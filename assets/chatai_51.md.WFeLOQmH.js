An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds). His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21. In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976). Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: When did Bob Hayes go to the Olympics?","response":"Bob Hayes went to the Olympics in 1964, as mentioned in the text: \\"At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter.\\""},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Slashdong is a blog about teledildonics and similar use of technology for erotic purposes. 2. Slashdong is a blog about teledildonics and a similar use of technology for erotic purposes. Step 1: Identify the differences between the two sentences The only difference between the two sentences is the presence of the indefinite article \\"a\\" in the second sentence. Step 2: Examine the effects of the difference In the first sentence, \\"similar use of technology for erotic purposes\\" implies that the blog covers various uses of technology that are related to teledildonics and have a similar purpose, which is erotic in nature. The use of \\"similar\\" here refers to the whole category or range of technologies used for erotic purposes. In the second sentence, the presence of \\"a\\" before \\"similar use of technology for erotic purposes\\" could be interpreted to mean that the blog is about teledildonics and one specific, similar use of technology for erotic purposes. It focuses on teledildonics and one other example of technology being used for erotic purposes. Step 3: Compare the meanings The first sentence implies that the blog covers a range of similar technologies used for erotic purposes, while the second sentence can be interpreted to focus on just teledildonics and one other similar use of technology for erotic purposes.

Question: suppose there will be weaker earthquakes happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"Weaker earthquakes can have varying effects on the occurrence of more or stronger earthquakes. These effects can be categorized into three main scenarios: more effect, less effect, and no effect. 1. More effect: Weaker earthquakes can sometimes increase the likelihood of stronger earthquakes by driving stress changes along different fault lines. When stress from one fault is released through a smaller earthquake, it may be transferred to nearby faults. This could cause a chain reaction, where the added stress makes it more likely for a larger earthquake to occur in the future. This phenomenon is called stress triggering, and it plays a significant role in how earthquakes progress and interact with one another. 2. Less effect: On the other hand, weaker earthquakes can sometimes help release pent-up stress in the Earth's crust, ultimately making stronger earthquakes less likely. When small earthquakes occur, they release energy and stress along the fault lines, which might decrease the chances of a larger, more powerful earthquake from happening. This can be observed in regions with frequent small earthquakes, where the constant release of stress prevents the build-up required for major seismic events. 3. No effect: In some cases, weaker earthquakes might have no significant impact on the occurrence of stronger earthquakes. Earthquakes can take place on different fault systems and at varying depths within the Earth's crust. These factors might result in weaker earthquakes having no direct correlation to stronger ones if the fault systems or depths differ significantly. Moreover, earthquakes in different parts of the world might have no influence on one another due to the vast distances between them and the dynamics of the Earth's tectonic plates. To summarize, weaker earthquakes can have more, less, or no effect on the occurrence of stronger earthquakes. This depends on the particular circumstances surrounding the fault systems, tectonic plates, and regions where the quakes take place. Further research into understanding the complex interactions between earthquakes can help predict their effects and assist in preparing for future seismic events."},{"question":"Context:Our family walked around these model houses and it was really cool .

Context: The question states that the performance is taking place at the school, implying it is a school-related event. The school band is the most common ensemble for student musicians to participate in within their educational institutions. It also encompasses a wider range of potential settings for the performance. 2. Instrument inclusion: The trombone is a versatile instrument, often found in different musical ensembles like brass quartets, orchestras, and marching bands. However, the trombone's presence in a school band is almost guaranteed, as they usually have a balanced mix of brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. This increases the likelihood of Mark playing in the school band. 3. Age-appropriate setting: School bands are specifically designed for young musicians learning to play their instruments and perform with others, which suits the situation well. Other options like orchestras or brass quartets often require higher levels of technical proficiency and may not be as age-appropriate for students. 4. Accessibility for parents: In this scenario, it mentions that \\"all the parents gathered in the cafeteria,\\" indicating a welcoming and easily accessible event for the families. School band concerts usually invite family, friends, and the school community to attend, making it more likely that it would be a school band performance. 5.

The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls.

A licence plate is like a car's name tag, and it helps people know who the car belongs to. Well, this Smart Hat will also have a tiny licence plate, so people can see and recognize the bicycle riders. This could help in case there's an accident or if someone loses their bicycle. But, guess what? Some bicycle riders are not happy about the licence plate on the Smart Hat. They may feel like it is not necessary, and they are worried about their privacy. It's important to know that everyone has different ideas, and we should always listen and try to understand why they feel that way. So, kiddos, the Smart Hat is a creative idea that can help make riding bicycles much safer by showing important information to the rider. However, we should also try to understand why some people may not like the idea of a licence plate on their helmets. And that's the story of the Smart Hat for responsible cyclists! What do you think about this invention? Is it a great way to help riders be safer, or are there other ways to make sure everyone enjoys riding their bikes? Let's discuss and share our ideas!"},{"question":"Combine facts and answer this: Who of Karen Carpenter and Alexi Laiho is from farther west?

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Tim had the cat for a few days.\\"?","response":"Based on the text provided, there is no solid evidence to suggest that \\"Tim had the cat for a few days.\\" Here is my step-by-step reasoning: 1) The text stated \\"Tim was walking home one day. He saw a cat and took it with him.\\" This line does not indicate how long he had the cat; it could have been a few minutes, a few hours, or maybe a few days. 2) The following part of the narrative - \\"After a while a neighbor knocked on his door\\" - is vague. \\"After a while,\\" could mean several things: it could be short as a few moments after Tim brought the cat home, or as long as a few days or even longer. However, it's not explicitly stated how much time passed. 3) There is no additional information within the text to provide a specific timeline.

Let's break it down to understand the positivity in the statement. 1. \\"Made\\": This word indicates that the person or entity being referred to has completed or produced something, which is generally seen as a positive action. In the context of the phrase, it shows accomplishment and productivity. 2. \\"Decent\\": This word is used to describe something that is fairly good or adequate. While it does not indicate a level of excellence, it does imply that the outcome or result is satisfactory or meets a certain standard. In this regard, 'decent' has a positive connotation, as it reflects a level of quality that is acceptable. 3. \\"Intro\\": This word serves as shorthand for an introduction or introductory aspect. An intro documentary typically provides an overview, basic information, or serves as a starting point for a topic or subject matter. This can be considered a positive element in the sense that it is beneficial for the audience to have an accessible and easy-to-understand introduction to a topic. 4. \\"Documentary\\": A documentary is a non-fiction film that presents factual information, often including interviews, photographs, and video footage, to inform, educate, or entertain an audience. Generally, documentaries are considered to be a positive medium, as they help to spread knowledge and raise awareness of various subjects. Taking all these components into consideration, the phrase \\"made a decent 'intro' documentary\\" can be perceived as positive. This statement praises the accomplishment of creating a satisfactory introductory documentary that fulfills its purpose of providing a basic understanding of a subject matter to its audience. However, it is worth noting that using the word 'decent' implies that there is room for improvement and that the documentary may not have achieved the highest level of quality or impact, but it still is seen as a positive achievement."},{"question":"Given a sentence, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

But the 35-year-old would never reach his destination. At an intersection near his home, he was ambushed and shot to death. Investigators found 34 bullet casings at the scene. Juarez was found facing down with multiple bullet wounds in his head, chest and left side of his body. His death made headlines in the Mexican city across the border from El Paso, Texas. Not only was the victim a police officer, but he was also the eighth member of the force to be murdered in two weeks. The number of violent deaths in OPTIONS: - CNN dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Ciudad Juarez dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - El Paso dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Juarez dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Julian Juarez Baena dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Mexican dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Mexico dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. - Texas dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before.","response":"The number of violent deaths in Ciudad Juarez dropped by almost 40% last year compared with the year before. However, the recent surge in police officer killings has raised concerns about the security situation in the city. Local authorities are alarmed by the increasing trend of targeting law enforcement personnel. Several motives could be behind these targeted attacks, including drug cartels, revenge for crackdowns on criminal activity, or internal disputes within the police force. In response to the killings, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Armando Cabada, has declared an emergency and called for immediate action to be taken by the municipal and state police forces, as well as the National Guard. He cited the need for a coordinated effort between all levels of government to address the issue and ensure the safety of police officers and the public. The governor of the state of Chihuahua, Javier Corral, stated that the state is working closely with federal authorities to implement strategies aimed at preventing further attacks on law enforcement personnel. He also highlighted the importance of purging corruption within the police force and establishing a trustworthy justice system, which could potentially reduce the influence of organized crime. In order to combat the violence and protect the community, Ciudad Juarez has increased police presence in high-risk areas and is working on intelligence-driven initiatives to identify and prosecute those behind this recent wave of killings. Additionally, the city is providing police officers with more advanced equipment and training, while offering assistance to their families in cases of loss. Community leaders, as well as federal and state authorities, have called for more resources and support to be allocated towards strengthening the police force and enhancing crime prevention programs. Such initiatives include a focus on rehabilitation and social development projects, improving collaboration between police and the public, and bolstering the capacity of specialized units to address violent crime. Despite the dramatic drop in violent deaths last year, the recent targeted killings of police officers in Ciudad Juarez underscore the complex and persistent challenges the city faces in overcoming the influence of organized crime and corruption. As efforts to address these concerns continue, the government must prioritize intelligence gathering, collaboration between law enforcement agencies, and investments in social development programs that break the cycle of violence and foster long-term peace and security in Ciudad Juarez and the surrounding region."},{"question":"Choose your answer from options.

It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime. The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. \\"not guilty\\"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of \\"not proven\\", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \\"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \\"the use of power\\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable. There... - An ambush is a long-established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from ancient to modern warfare. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a mountain pass, or a small guerrilla band or insurgent group attacking a regular armed force patrol. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Charles Swan ( died 1690 ) was a reluctant buccaneer . Captain Swan was forced into piracy by his crew in the 1680s , and proceeded to write letters to the owners of his ship Cygnet in London , begging them to intercede with James II of England for his pardon - even as he looted his way up and down the coast of South America . He was present at the attack on Payta in 1684 , where he petulantly burned the town after no booty was found . On 25 August 1685 , he separated from his confederates Peter Harris and Edward Davis , and sailed up the coast of Mexico , but met with little success . He seized the town of Santa Pecaque but lost fifty men to a Spanish counter-attack , including Basil Ringrose . On 31 March 1686 he set out across the Pacific to ambush the Manila treasure galleon , but failed to over-take the ship . Due to the failure of the assault on Santa Pecaque provisions were short , and by the time they reached the East Indies the crew were plotting to eat their officers of the Cygnet as it crossed the Pacific ( starting with the Captain ) . ( Swan is reported to have remarked that the lean William Dampier would have made them a poor meal ; the captain himself was a remarkably fat man . ) Fortunately they arrived at Guam without resorting to cannibalism , and made their way on to the Sultanate of Mindanao . The arrogance of Swan and unruliness of his men soon spoiled their good relations with the local ruler , Raja Laut ; and when the captain decided to abandon the attempt on the galleon , his men mutinied . He managed to save five thousand pounds ( legally the property of the Cygnet 's owners ) from the mutineers , and remained in Mindanao , becoming an officer in Laut 's army ; but in 1690 he attempted to escape back to England on a Dutch ship with the money , and was chased by Laut 's warriors , who capsized his boat and speared him in the water . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Buccaneers were pirates of the Caribbean Sea who challenged Spanish hegemony on the region by attacking ships and sacking coastal settlements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Before long, they became a threat to non-Spanish settlements as well, and the target of anti-piracy crusades. Today the idea of a buccaneer plays a role similar to \\"pirate\\". Original buccaneer crews, however, were larger, localized to the Caribbean region, and more apt to attack well-defended ports than pirates who sailed to the Indian Ocean on the Pirate Round of the late 17th century. - James II and VII (14 October 1633 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. - A pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if never convicted. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - The Sea Peoples were a purported seafaring confederation of groups known to have attacked ancient Egypt prior to the Late Bronze Age collapse. Following the creation of the concept in the nineteenth century, it became one of the most famous chapters of Egyptian history, given its connection with, in the words of Wilhelm Max Müller: \\"the most important questions of ethnography and the primitive history of classic nations\\". - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689. - Piracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship- or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Pirate Round was a sailing route followed by certain Anglo-American pirates, mainly during the late 17th century. The course led from the western Atlantic, around the southern tip of Africa, stopping at Madagascar, then on to targets such as the coast of Yemen and India. The Pirate Round was briefly used again during the early 1720s. Pirates who followed the route are sometimes referred to as Roundsmen. The Pirate Round was largely co-extensive with the routes of the East India Company ships, of Britain and other nations. - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - A privateer was a private person or ship that engaged in maritime warfare under a commission of war. The commission, also known as a letter of marque, empowered the person to carry on all forms of hostility permissible at sea by the usages of war, including attacking foreign vessels during wartime and taking them as prizes. Captured ships were subject to condemnation and sale under prize law, with the proceeds divided between the privateer sponsors, shipowners, captains and crew. A percentage share usually went to the issuer of the commission. Since robbery under arms was common to seaborne trade, all merchant ships were already armed. During war, naval resources were auxiliary to operations on land so privateering was a way of subsidizing state power by mobilizing armed ships and sailors. - Commerce raiding is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. It is also known, in French, as guerre de course (literally, \\"war of the chase\\") and, in German, Handelskrieg (\\"trade war\\"), from the nations most heavily committed to it historically as a strategy. - Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word \\"rob\\" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. \\"deraubare\\") of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic \\"raub\\" -- \\"theft\\". - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside.

Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density. - A hammermill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including: - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester. - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company . - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton. - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte. - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting. - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade. - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine. - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England. - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work. - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on. - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture. - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel. - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

Máel Sechnaill succeeded his predecessor, Muirchertach mac Mael Sechnaill, and was later succeeded by Mael Sechnaill got mac Mael Sechnaill. As a powerful leader, he derived his authority from his role as a king and military leader, often engaging in conflict with rival factions throughout his reign. His queenship was marked by his marriage to Gormflaith ingen Murchada, an influential and prominent figure in her own right. Together, they formed a powerful alliance that further solidified Máel Sechnaill's authority. Despite his successes, Máel Sechnaill's later years were marked by challenges to his authority, most notably from Brian Boru, who eventually defeated him in 1002, and briefly became the High King of Ireland. However, Máel Sechnaill regained his influence following Brian Boru's death in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.

Answer:","response":"The last step of the process would be to remove the now-frozen ice cubes from the tray and use them as desired, such as in a cold beverage or to chill a food item. This final step involves a few sub-steps to ensure the ice cubes are easily removed from the tray and ready for usage. 1. Allow enough time for the water to freeze completely: Depending on the temperature of the freezer and the size of the ice cube tray, this could take anywhere from a couple of hours to overnight. It is important to wait until the water has frozen entirely, as attempting to remove partially frozen ice cubes can be challenging and may result in broken or misshaped cubes. 2. Check on the progress: Periodically, you may want to check on the progress of the freezing process by opening the freezer and inspecting the ice cube tray. When the water has turned completely solid and appears opaque or white, it's a good indication that the ice cubes are ready to be removed. 3. Prepare the ice cube tray for removal: Before attempting to remove the ice cubes, it can be helpful to loosen them from the tray slightly. One method for doing this is to gently twist the ice cube tray from side to side. Another alternative is to briefly run the underside of the tray under cold or lukewarm water, taking care not to melt the ice cubes too much. This will help to release the ice cubes from the tray more easily. 4. Remove the ice cubes from the tray: With the ice cubes loosened, you can now remove them from the tray. Depending on the specific design of the tray, you might need to push on the bottom of each individual ice cube compartment to pop the ice cubes out, or simply invert the tray and give it a gentle tap on the countertop. 5. Store the ice cubes (if not using immediately): If you're not planning on using the ice cubes right away, it's a good idea to transfer them from the ice cube tray to a sealed container or resealable plastic bag. This will prevent them from absorbing any unpleasant odors or flavors from other items in the freezer. 6. Clean and refill the ice cube tray (optional): After removing all the ice cubes, you can choose to clean and refill the tray with water if you need more ice for future use. Simply wash the tray with warm water and mild dish soap, rinse it thoroughly, fill it with water again, and return it to the freezer to begin the freezing process anew. By following these steps, you will have successfully completed the last phase of the ice-making process and can enjoy the chilled benefits of your frozen ice cubes."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future. Question: From the passage we can infer _ Answer: A:","response":"From the passage, we can infer that consuming excessive amounts of sugar can have serious negative effects on health, potentially leading to long-term changes, altering development, and shortening lives. This is supported by the University of Utah study, where mice fed diets high in sugar had a higher mortality rate and faced reproductive issues, even without displaying signs of obesity or high blood pressure."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Answer choices: - bill - skin - growth - sugar - fat - H 2 O - organ - muscle Answer:","response":"The bill of a bird is generally adapted to the kind of food that they eat. Bird bills, also known as beaks, have evolved into various shapes and sizes to specialize in a particular diet or feeding strategy, which in turn helps birds to exploit food resources in their specific environment. Bird bills serve several functions, including preening, nesting material collection, handling food, and even defense. However, one of their most important roles is as a primary feeding tool. A bird's bill is made up mostly of keratin, a strong, flexible, and lightweight protein that is continually growing and being worn away just like our fingernails. There is a tremendous variety of bill shapes and sizes in the world of birds, each uniquely suited to help the bird feed on its preferred type of food. 1. Seed-eating birds: Species like finches, sparrows, and grosbeaks have stout, short, and strong bills that allow them to crack open hard seed shells to access the nutritious seed within. These robust bills are perfect for exerting the force necessary for breaking seeds apart. 2. Insect-eating birds: Birds that predominantly eat insects, such as warblers and flycatchers, have thin, pointed bills which enable them to pick out insects among the foliage, snatch them in mid-air or even glean them from the surface of tree trunks. The slender, needle-like bills are perfect for snatching up small prey. 3. Nectar-feeding birds: Species that feed on nectar, such as hummingbirds, have long, narrow bills that fit perfectly into tubular-shaped flowers to reach the nectar. Their bills are designed to easily suck up liquid from the flowers while hovering in the air. 4. Raptor birds: Raptors, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, have strong, hooked bills that are used for tearing apart their prey. These powerful and sharp-edged bills are ideal for dissecting and dismantling the flesh of other animals. 5. Wading birds: Wading birds like herons, egrets, and ibises possess long, sharp, pointed bills, well-suited for catching fish, frogs, and other aquatic prey. These elongated bills allow them to strike quickly in the water, with great precision and minimal disturbance to their surroundings. In summary, a bird's bill is the part of its body that is generally adapted to the kind of food that they eat. The shape, size, and structure of a bird's bill provide essential adaptations that support their feeding behavior and enable them to efficiently exploit the food resources found in their environment."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Question: suppose less metamorphic rock melts happens, how will it affect fewer animals are covered by sediment. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned.

Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. Context: Leno did not expect his show to beat competing first-run episodes, but to do better than reruns, in part because topical jokes benefit from the \\"immediacy\\" of the time slot versus 11:30 pm. A television analyst predicted that Leno would finish in \\"a safe third place\\" every night. NBC research before the show's debut indicated that fans of Leno would watch Leno two to three times a week. NBC saw a 1.5 rating for the show in the 18-49 demographic as \\"viable\\" and a 1.8 as a \\"home run\\". NBC told Leno that at a 1.5 rating, NBC makes 300 million a year. Tonight at 11:30 pm earned about a 1.3 to 1.5; the television audience at 10 pm is 40% larger than at 11:30 pm, and the network hoped Leno's audience would also grow. Industry observers have cited a range of ratings, from 1.7 to 2, as being necessary for the show to succeed at 10 pm. By comparison, 2.5 is generally necessary for a 10 pm drama to succeed; those that earned a 1.7 or less during the 2008-2009 season were generally cancelled. NBC's prime-time dramas averaged about 2 during 2008-2009. The first episode of The Jay Leno Show earned \\"fast national\\" estimates of 17.7 million viewers, an 11 Nielsen rating (5.1 among persons 18-49) and an 18 share, significantly above both his Tonight finale and the debut of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in all categories. By the second week and competing against season premieres, the audience fell to six million viewers, still on par with or exceeding NBC projections. As of November 1, 2009, The Jay Leno Show has averaged a 1.98 in the adults 18-49 ratings and 6.594 million viewers. During the week before Christmas, the ratings dropped to 1.4 during the week. Prior to the controversy regarding the move of the Jay Leno Show to 11:35 p.m., viewership bottomed out at 4.799 million viewers, although there was a slight bump as word of the controversy broke. Though the show had been meeting the network's projections for the show itself, it has been severely detrimental to the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates. Several stations across the country have seen what is known as the \\"Leno Effect\\", where the lower audience for Leno (as compared to NBC's scripted prime time offerings) translated directly into a domino effect of severe audience drops for late local news (on the order of 25-30%), effects that NBC had underestimated. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","response":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects in this article. One interesting point is that The Jay Leno Show was created to be similar to Jay Leno's version of The Tonight Show, featuring a comedic monologue, celebrity interviews, and comedy segments. Some sketches from The Tonight Show were even brought over to The Jay Leno Show along with new ones. Another interesting aspect is that Leno's show was expected to be in \\"a safe third place\\" each night, but NBC thought it would do better than reruns because of the \\"immediacy\\" of topical jokes. They also believed that fans of Leno would watch the show two to three times a week, and a rating of 1.5 in the 18-49 demographic was considered \\"viable\\" by the network. Finally, the ratings of The Jay Leno Show were interesting. The first episode had a significant number of viewers, but the audience dropped when competing against season premieres of other shows. The show also had a negative effect on local news ratings, known as the \\"Leno Effect,\\" which NBC had underestimated."},{"question":"– In the latest adventures of Cory Booker, the Newark mayor—who tends to be at the center of the action—is set to undergo a food-stamp challenge.

When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only 25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling 70 million, are to be left to a corporate trust, unless a blood heir can be found. Brittney's brash, relatively poor classmate Maya (Leila Arcieri) suddenly claims to be Dunlap's illegitimate daughter as the result of her mother's extramarital affair. She is ordered by a judge to submit to a DNA test, the result of which proves she is Dunlap's child. At the Dunlap home, Brittney hears a noise on her way to the wine cellar but it turns out to just be rats. Suddenly Maya appears and the girls reveal they are lovers before being joined by Dr. Julian Haynes (Joe Michael Burke), who had arranged the DNA test. The trio are in cahoots, running a scam to secure and share Dunlap's fortune. Insurance investigator Terence Bridge (Isaiah Washington), investigating the circumstances of the plane crash, finds out from Dunlap's medical records that Dunlap had scarlet fever as a child, one of the side effects of which can be sterility, and asks Dr. Haynes how Dunlap could have fathered a child. Dr. Haynes gets nervous about the plot unraveling and contacts Maya. He agrees to meet her and Brittney that night at the docks, where Maya shoots him. The two girls dispose of his body in Gator Alley. After Bridge learns the entire affair was planned, he shows up at the Dunlap home and demands half the money in return for not going to the police. Brittney, refusing to give up any of the money, gets a gun and points it at Bridge, but instead kills Maya. She tells Bridge that he has to earn his half.

Publishing your book in hardback will be expensive, but many readers may love the higher quality. It also might help your book get picked up by news outlets and book critics, who are more likely to consider a hardback as a more “literary” work--unfair as that may be! Trade paperbacks are still weighty, about the same size as hardbacks, and printed on good paper. They have the advantage of quality craftsmanship coupled with a lower price than a hardback edition. The book still looks good, so it can appeal to readers who are on a budget but still care about a book’s appearance. A small, mass-market edition will be the cheapest to buy and produce. They may not look as good as hardback or trade paperback versions, but publishing companies consider mass-market copies as great ways to introduce new authors and help them grow their readership. This is a rapidly-growing medium that will expose you to many different readers online and help you conserve even more money by saving on printing costs. You may not get the satisfaction of holding the physical book in your hands, but remember that e-publishing can serve as a stepping stone to print publishing. You’re on your way!

In a dark recording studio, Jim Morrison, lead singer for the rock band, The Doors, drinks whiskey while recording spoken-word versions of his poetry. The engineer (a cameo appearance by Doors drummer, John Densmore) plays a pre-recorded music track and Jim begins to recite his work \\"An American Prayer\\".In a flashback to 1949, a young Jim and his family are seen driving across the Southwestern United States in New Mexico. They pass the scene of a car accident involving two families; one family are American Indians. An old Indian man lies dying on the side of the road. Jim watches until his family has driven out of sight.The film then jumps to 1965. Jim is seen hitchhiking to California and is picked up by a motorist. In Los Angeles Jim attends UCLA's film school. His student film, an artistic and surreal collection of haunting images, is heavily criticized by both his classmates and his professor (a cameo by director Oliver Stone). His future band mate, Ray Manzarek, tells Jim that his movie is commendable, despite the criticism. When the professor asks Jim to defend the film, Jim says simply \\"I quit.\\"Jim takes up residence in Venice Beach and meets Pamela Courson, his future wife.

Original sentence information: 1. A black man. 2. In a dress shirt. 3. Is looking through a microscope. 4. A poster about blood cells. 5. Poster is on the wall in the background. Condensed sentence information: 1. A man. 2. Uses a microscope. 3. A poster hanging behind him. Step 1: Compare the subjects of the sentences. The original sentence describes \\"a black man\\" while the condensed sentence only says \\"a man.\\" These two descriptions are compatible since both refer to a man. So, the first part of the condensed sentence is correct. Step 2: Compare the actions of the sentences. The original sentence says the man \\"is looking through a microscope,\\" and the condensed sentence says \\"uses a microscope.\\" These two actions are essentially the same. Therefore, the second part of the condensed sentence is also correct. Step 3: Compare the contextual information of the sentences. The original sentence mentions \\"a poster about blood cells\\" and says that it \\"is on the wall in the background.\\" The condensed sentence says \\"a poster hanging behind him.\\" While they do not specifically mention that it is about blood cells in the condensed sentence, it is still true that there is a poster hanging in the background. So, the third part of the condensed sentence is correct as well. Based on these comparisons, the sentence \\"A man uses a microscope with a poster hanging behind him.\\" is true based on the information provided in the original sentence, although it omits some specific details (such as the man's appearance and the poster's content)."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Alimentum, eatType = restaurant, food = Japanese, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = 5 out of 5, area = city centre, near = Yippee Noodle Bar.

His works, like \\"Tropic of Cancer,\\" \\"Tropic of Capricorn,\\" and \\"Black Spring,\\" often contained explicit content that sparked censorship debates and legal battles due to their candid nature and portrayal of sexuality. Anaïs Nin, on the other hand, was Miller's contemporary and shared a close personal and professional relationship with him.

It has a population of - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - Lake Christabel is a small lake in the north of New Zealand's South Island. It is located 12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass. The lake is the source of the Grey River, one of the longest rivers on the South Island's West Coast, although its outlet is underground. The lake lies behind a landslide dam, thought to have been created by a prehistoric earthquake. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions.

The lake 's outflow is the Arnold River , a tributary of the Grey River . The lake lies 31 kilometres to the southeast of Greymouth . The main settlement close to the lake is Moana , on the northern shore . Located several kilometres inland from the coast road ( State Highway 6 ) , it is less frequently visited by tourists than many of the West Coast 's scenic highlights , but it is becoming increasingly popular , in part due to its reputation for fishing . Lake Brunner was named by John Rochfort for the 19th century explorer Thomas Brunner . The Mori name for the lake , Kotuku moana , means \`\` Sea of herons '' . The New Zealand freshwater mussel ( Hyridella menziesi ) is found in the lake . By 1976 twenty percent of the catchment of the lake was farmed and there was a population of 84 at the settlement of Moana . - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate. - The Grey River / Mwheranui is located in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in Lake Christabel, one of numerous small lakes on the western side of the Southern Alps,12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass, and runs westward for 120 kilometres before draining into the Tasman Sea at Greymouth. The river was named by explorer Thomas Brunner in honour of New Zealand politician Sir George Grey. The official name of the river was changed to Grey River / Mwheranui in 1998 by way of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The Maori name for the river system and surrounding area is Mwhera, with Mwheranui being distinguished from the northern branch Little Grey River / Mwheraiti. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. - Greymouth is the largest town in the West Coast region in the South Island of New Zealand, and the seat of the Grey District Council.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Thomas Brunner (April 1821 22 April 1874) was an English-born surveyor and explorer remembered for his exploration of the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\".

The two statements are distinct and describe different situations, which means that the truth of one statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the other. This is because the key difference between the premise and the hypothesis lies in the subject of the action - a man in the premise, and a woman in the hypothesis. As a result, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is necessarily true if the premise is true because the subjects involved are different. To further understand this, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their respective components: Premise: - Subject: A man - Action: Pulling - Object: A cart full of cleaning supplies Hypothesis: - Subject: A woman - Action: Pulling - Object: A cart full of cleaning supplies As seen above, the subjects in the premise and hypothesis are different. The truth of the premise does not provide any information about the woman and her actions mentioned in the hypothesis. If the premise is true, it confirms that a man is pulling a cart full of cleaning supplies, but it does not give us any information about whether a woman is also pulling a cart full of cleaning supplies.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Answer: The statement, \\"Early theological beliefs are typically referred to collectively as Paganism, typically European,\\" requires further elaboration to provide a detailed understanding. Firstly, it is essential to define \\"early theological beliefs\\" and \\"Paganism\\" to establish context and accuracy. In the case of early theological beliefs, these are ancient religious practices and beliefs which predate modern, organized religions. Paganism, on the other hand, is a term used to describe various polytheistic religious traditions, particularly those of pre-Christian Europe. This term encompasses a wide array of belief systems and practices, often centered around the worship of multiple gods and goddesses connected to nature, the elements, and celestial bodies. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. It is accurate to say that many early theological beliefs could be referred to as \\"Paganism\\", as these traditions often share the feature of being polytheistic and focused on natural or celestial deities. 2. However, it is important to recognize that Paganism as a term is not only applied to European religious beliefs. While it is typically used to describe pre-Christian European belief systems, Paganism can also encompass religious beliefs from other parts of the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The term is more of an umbrella category, rather than representing a single, specific religion. 3. Moreover, Paganism should not be considered synonymous with early theological beliefs or ancient religions as a whole. For example, even though some early belief systems can be categorized as Pagan, others like Zoroastrianism or early forms of Hinduism might not fit within this classification. In conclusion, the statement, \\"Early theological beliefs are typically referred to collectively as Paganism, typically European,\\" is partially accurate. Paganism does include a broad range of early theological beliefs, particularly focused on European pre-Christian traditions. However, Paganism is not an exclusive term for all early theological beliefs, as the term also encompasses a variety of religious practices worldwide, and there are some ancient belief systems not fitting within the classification of Paganism."},{"question":"Please capitalize where necessary: we have your legal documents translated by experienced translators with university law degrees who understand the legal system in bulgaria or other countries where the text is to be used.","response":"We have your legal documents translated by experienced translators with university law degrees who understand the legal system in Bulgaria or other countries where the text is to be used."},{"question":"Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"the soldier wears a down jacket to protect himself from a bullet\\" - Sentence B: \\"the soldier wears a body armor to protect himself from a bullet\\" Hmmm, let me think. I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, let's break down each sentence and analyze its meaning step-by-step: 1. Sentence A: \\"the soldier wears a down jacket to protect himself from a bullet\\" - A \\"down jacket\\" is typically made of a soft, insulating material, used primarily to keep a person warm in cold weather. - \\"Protecting himself from a bullet\\" implies that the garment is expected to provide some level of resistance against bullets. - Down jackets are not designed to protect against bullets, making this statement seem illogical. 2. Sentence B: \\"the soldier wears a body armor to protect himself from a bullet\\" - \\"Body armor\\" is specifically designed to protect a person from various threats, such as ballistic (bullet) impacts. - \\"Protecting himself from a bullet\\" is a primary function of body armor. - This statement is logical, as body armor would indeed provide some level of protection against bullets. Given this analysis, Sentence A (\\"the soldier wears a down jacket to protect himself from a bullet\\") does not make sense because a down jacket is not designed to protect against bullets. On the other hand, Sentence B makes sense, as body armor is meant for this purpose."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Now, I have a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. Answer this question please: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","response":"Based on the background information provided, the number of melanocytes in an individual's skin remains the same regardless of skin color, so the main factor that we can consider is UV light exposure, which increases melanin production. In the given situation, Robin starts exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, which will stimulate her melanocytes to produce more melanin. On the other hand, Samantha chooses not to expose herself to UV light and just uses lotion on her skin. As a result, her melanocytes will not receive the same UV light stimulation as Robin's. Considering these factors, Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin than Robin. It's important to note that the amount of melanin in Samantha's skin will still depend on her genetic predisposition and any inborn melanin production. Nonetheless, by not exposing her skin to UV light, Samantha is not artificially boosting her melanin levels like Robin is doing through repeated tanning sessions. Since Robin's tanning regimen is specifically designed to increase melanin production, it's clear that Samantha will have comparatively less melanin in this specific situation. However, the vitamin D production in Samantha might be reduced as well, increasing her risk of deficiency, and it is important to ensure that she obtains vitamin D through other sources like diet or supplements if necessary."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people.

If it is a prime number, we need to output 'Yes', otherwise output 'No'. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 and its only factors are 1 and itself. Given number: 91765 To determine if 91765 is a prime number, we will check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Step 1: Find the square root of the given number, because the divisors occur in pairs, and the largest possible divisor (besides itself) would occur below the square root value. The square root of 91765 is approximately 302.09. Step 2: Check for the divisors from 2 to 302. We find that 3 * 30555 = 91765. This means that 91765 is not a prime number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 30555).

Obama says congressional leaders have agreed to schedule a debate and vote when they return to session. They are scheduled to return from their summer recess on Sept. 9. The president did not say whether he'd forgo a strike if Congress rejects his call to action. \\"After careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets,\\" Obama said. \\"This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. \\"This attack is an assault on human dignity,\\" Obama said of the alleged Aug. 21 chemical assault the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Assad's regime. \\"It also presents a serious danger to our national security.\\" The remarks came amid a flurry of briefings for skeptical lawmakers by the president's national security team. Shouts from hundreds of activists outside the White House protesting against military action could be heard from the Rose Garden shortly before Obama spoke. \\"Over the last several days, we've heard from several members of Congress who want their voices to be heard,\\" Obama said. \\"I absolutely agree.\\" FULL COVERAGE: Latest developments in Syria STORY: 5 possible risks of a U.S. military strike on Syria House Speaker John Boehner announced in a joint statement with the GOP House leadership that he expected to consider a measure that would authorize the president to carry out a military strike the week of Sept. 9. \\"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\\" the statement said. \\"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Obama's decision. \\"The president's role as commander in chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress,\\" McConnell said. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization as \\"absolutely the right decision.\\" Corker in recent weeks had been a public advocate for an authorization vote, contending that the Congress too often takes a back seat on determining critical foreign policy decisions. Obama said some have advised not to seek Congress' approval, noting that the British Parliament this week rejected a similar call for action by Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama also rejected Boehner's notion that he must seek congressional authorization. \\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\\" Obama said. \\"We should have this debate. The issues are too big for business as usual.\\" The president's senior advisers had initially advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, according to a senior administration official. Obama indicated last Saturday during a National Security Council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations. But when Obama convened his senior advisers on Friday night to tell them he had decided to take military action, he also told his advisers that he would seek Congressional authorization, the official said. In the Friday night meeting and again on Saturday morning, Obama explained his reasoning to his advisers for seeking congressional backing. The same aides who had advised him not to go to lawmakers for backing threw their support behind his plan. Obama's remarks on Saturday afternoon came hours after United Nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus, left Syria bound for the Netherlands. The chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, which U.S. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children. They have taken blood and urine samples from victims and soil samples from areas where chemical attacks have been reported. The samples will be tested in Europe. Obama attempted to put the onus on Congress, which he suggested has a moral responsibility to take action. He noted that Americans have become weary after more than a decade of war, but that something as heinous as a chemical attack could not be ignored. \\"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\\" Obama said. The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the civil war in Syria that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a \\"red line\\" that must not be crossed. The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups. Obama said that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has advised him that the U.S. military's capacity to execute a strike is not time-sensitive. Five U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with land-attack cruise missiles are deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and stand ready to carry out an assault on the president's order. \\"In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security,\\" Obama said. \\"And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/15IWQnI ||||| President Barack Obama says he has decided that the United States should take military action against Syria in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack.

The article ignited a heated discussion on Twitter, with some readers sharing their experiences of harassment in the science field. The professor, Jason Lieb, a molecular biologist, made unwelcome sexual advances to several female graduate students at an off-campus retreat of the molecular biosciences division, according to a university investigation letter obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Lieb, 43, also engaged in sexual activity with a student who was “incapacitated due to alcohol and therefore could not consent.” The article highlighted an increasingly tense debate over how universities deal with harassment claims in their science departments. Students and faculty members at the University of Chicago blamed the school, saying it overlooked previous accusations against Mr. Lieb when he worked at the University of North Carolina, and did not find out why he resigned abruptly from Princeton University after just seven months.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. and the situation: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids. Answer the following question: When both liquids are at equilibrium, which liquid will have less molecules in the liquid phase? A:","response":"Liquid A Given the background information, it is essential to consider the strength of the intermolecular forces when discussing the properties of liquids A and B, and how these forces influence vapor pressure and the number of molecules in the liquid phase. To recap, vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid when that substance is at equilibrium, and it is affected by the strength of intermolecular forces and temperature. Stronger intermolecular forces cause an increase in viscosity and surface tension while decreasing vapor pressure, as it is harder for the molecules to escape into the gas phase. In contrast, weaker intermolecular forces result in lower viscosity and surface tension and higher vapor pressure, as it is easier for the molecules to escape into the gas phase. In this situation, liquid A has stronger intermolecular forces compared to liquid B, which has weaker intermolecular forces. When both liquids are at equilibrium, liquid A (with stronger intermolecular forces) will have a lower vapor pressure, meaning it is more challenging for its molecules to escape into the gas phase from the liquid phase. Consequently, this will result in a higher concentration of molecules in the liquid phase for liquid A. On the other hand, liquid B (with weaker intermolecular forces) will have a higher vapor pressure, implying that it's easier for its molecules to escape into the gas phase from the liquid phase. As a result, the concentration of molecules in the liquid phase will be lower for liquid B compared to liquid A. Therefore, when both liquids are at equilibrium, liquid A will have more molecules in the liquid phase, and liquid B will have less molecules in the liquid phase."},{"question":"Based on the premise \\"and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The men that drive the trucks aren't tested very much.\\" is true (see options)?

As Fidell stated, \\"I think it's important that people, particularly people who have been vilified, have proper representation, and every lawyer has a responsibility to represent even unpopular clients.” Eugene Fidell brings years of experience to the table, particularly in cases involving military justice. His expertise, combined with his commitment to providing legal representation for all, is expected to be a valuable asset in fighting for the rights of Bergdahl. As for the progress of the case, Fidell mentioned that substantive interviews with Bergdahl regarding the circumstances of his capture by the Taliban will likely not take place for at least another two weeks. It is crucial to provide a thorough account of the traumatizing events he experienced in order to build a strong defense. In conclusion, the addition of Eugene Fidell to Bowe Bergdahl's legal team is a significant development in this high-profile case. Fidell's commitment to providing proper representation for even unpopular clients, coupled with his expertise in military justice, makes his involvement crucial as the case moves forward. With interviews expected to begin in the coming weeks, the true circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's capture and subsequent treatment by the Taliban will soon be brought to light."},{"question":"What happens next?

Here are some tips on how to do that: 1. First, we need to make sure your profile picture looks really nice, just like a well-dressed and happy person. People like to be friends with those who look good and friendly. So, ask someone to take a nice photo of you or find the best one you have. 2. Now, you want to search for these beautiful people. You can find them by joining groups or pages where they like to hang out, like fashion, fitness, or beauty groups. It's like going to a party where all the cool kids are and wanting to join their group. 3. Once you find them, you can send them a friend request. But remember, just like you wouldn't want a stranger asking to be friends in a playground, it's the same on Facebook. It's a good idea to send them a short message to introduce yourself and say why you want to be friends. Be nice and polite, like you would in the real world. 4. Finally, keep in mind that not everyone will accept your friend request, and that's okay! Don't get upset or discouraged.

Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good.

Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment. But I can use this background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . What is an answer for this question: Does Cell A have more or less nuclei than Cell B? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine if Cell A has more or less nuclei than Cell B. Gary only observed and reported the size difference between the two cells but did not provide any details about the number of nuclei or other cellular structures. Although large cells like some white blood cells might have more nuclei to support their increased metabolic needs, it is not a guarantee that Cell A has more nuclei just because of its size. Moreover, cells from different organisms or even different cell types within the same organism can vary significantly in their structures and functions. To accurately answer this question, Gary would need to observe and compare the number of nuclei in both Cell A and Cell B under the microscope."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: A comfort for adults, too Review: I read this book to my son last night.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... According to the above context, answer the following question. When are supplements mainly of assistance to people? Answer:","response":"Supplements are mainly of assistance to people with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets. They can be helpful if dietary sources are lacking."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Sort through the berries and pull out any that are moldy or overripe. Put the berries in a plastic container lined with paper towels. Lay the lid on top of the container so that it's slightly ajar. Keep the berries in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\\"","response":"Title: The Art of Keeping Berries Fresh: A Guide to Proper Storage Introduction: One of the most delightful aspects of summertime is the abundance of fresh, juicy berries. From blueberries to strawberries, raspberries to blackberries, these tasty fruits are not only delicious, but they are also packed with nutrients and antioxidants. However, one common challenge faced by berry-lovers is that these delicate fruits can spoil very quickly if not stored properly. In this article, we will provide guidance on how to keep your berries fresh for up to five days using a simple and effective storage method. Step 1: Sorting the Berries The first step to ensuring that your berries stay fresh for an extended period is to sort through them and remove any moldy or overripe ones. Overripe berries will continue to deteriorate even when stored correctly, and moldy berries can spread the mold to other healthy ones. By taking the time to inspect and remove these unwanted culprits, you are effectively eliminating the factors that could negatively impact the freshness of your remaining berries. Step 2: Preparing the Container Next, choose a suitable container that can safely hold your berries without crushing them. A plastic container is an ideal choice as it is lightweight, durable, and easy to clean. To absorb excess moisture and create a healthy environment for the berries, line the bottom of the container with paper towels. This layer of absorbent material will help prevent the development of mold and prolong the freshness of your berries. Step 3: Transferring the Berries to the Container Carefully place the sorted berries into the lined container, taking care not to overcrowd them. By leaving some space between the berries, you allow air to circulate more freely around each fruit, helping to prevent moisture buildup that could lead to mold growth. Step 4: Adjusting the Lid When it comes to sealing the container, the trick is to avoid completely closing it. Instead, lay the lid on top of the container so that it is slightly ajar. By creating a small opening, airflow is improved around the berries, allowing excess moisture to escape and preventing the fruits from becoming too damp and overly ripe. Step 5: Storing the Berries Finally, after the container is prepared and the berries are safely nestled inside, place the container in your refrigerator. The optimal temperature should be between 32 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 1 degree Celsius), which maintains the cold chain without freezing the berries. By keeping the berries chilled, you are significantly slowing down the natural ripening process, allowing them to stay fresh for up to five days. Conclusion: By following these five simple steps, you can enjoy your favorite berries and prolong their freshness without worrying about waste. This effective storage method not only keeps your fruits in tip-top condition but also guarantees that their delicious taste and essential nutrients are preserved. So go ahead, indulge in your favorite berries, and savor their goodness for days to come."},{"question":"Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Alphaville Movie plot: Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \\"the Outlands\\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed. He also learns that Swedes, Germans and Americans assimilate well with Alphaville. Images of the EÂ =Â mcÂ² and E = hf equations are displayed several times throughout the film as symbols of the regime of logical science that rules Alphaville.

(Lo Sai Hung/AP) Like a shot of adrenalin, Hong Kong quickens the pulse. Skyscrapers march up jungle-clad slopes by day and blaze neon by night, across a harbour criss-crossed by freighters and motor junks. Hong Kong can overwhelm but offers fantastic experiences, especially to visitors who are willing to step out of their comfort zone. See The Peak Tram rises above skyscrapers, departing from the lower terminus and climbing to the 552-metre Victoria Peak. On clear days and at night, the view from the top is amazing (7am-midnight, every 15 minutes; £3). The largest of Hong Kong’s Man Mo temples was the hub of civil life on the island in the 19th century. The Taoist temple was built in 1847 by Chinese merchants and was dedicated to the gods of literature, ‘man’, and of war, ‘mo’ (24-126 Hollywood Rd, Sheung Wan; 8am-6pm; free). Hong Kong’s first heritage trail, the Ping Shan, includes the territory’s oldest pagoda, a magnificent ancestral hall and temples. All were built by the Tang clan, the most powerful of the five clans that settled in the New Territories around the 11th century (West Rail Tin Shui Wai station, exit E; 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm; free). Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong’s liveliest.

Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the teams leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6–1 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16–0, in 1976 Los Angeles Rams season on Monday Night Football. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and 1976 Atlanta Falcons season that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G.

Barack Obama cautioned supporters Thursday against becoming complacent during the final days leading up to the election, noting he lost the New Hampshire primary despite a lead in the polls. After debating Sen. John McCain, Sen. Barack Obama says there's still plenty of campaigning to be done. \\"For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky and think this is all set, I just [have] two words for you: New Hampshire,\\" the Democratic presidential nominee said during a fundraiser breakfast in New York. \\"You know I've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked. And so that's another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me.\\" About 10 hours after debating Sen. John McCain, Obama urged top campaign contributors at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan to not be overconfident, despite leading in a number of national polls. A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Wednesday showed him leading 51 percent to 42 percent. \\"We've got 19 days,\\" Obama said. \\"We're going to have to work absolutely as hard as we've ever worked in our lives in order to just to get to the start of what is going to be a very difficult and very challenging but ultimately a very fulfilling four years where we can get this country back on track.\\" Watch more of Obama's comments ». Hours later, Obama spoke to a crowd in Londonderry, New Hampshire, lashing out at McCain's debate tactics. \\"Well, New Hampshire, last night we had a debate. I think you saw a bit of the McCain attack strategy in action,\\" he said. \\"But here's what Sen. McCain doesn't seem to understand: With the economy in turmoil and the American dream at risk, the American people don't want to hear politicians attack each other -- you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle-class families each and every day.\\" Obama urged McCain to \\"debate our genuine differences on the issues that matter\\" rather than making the Arizona senator's campaign \\"all about me.\\" \\"The truth is, this campaign is about you.

McCain, speaking at an event in Downington, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, touched on his debate performance. \\"We had a good debate last night. It was a lot of fun. ... I thought I did pretty well,\\" he said to loud cheers. McCain reiterated his position for taking America forward as economists say a recession is all but inevitable. \\"We can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change ... I'll take us in a new direction,\\" he said. \\"Our troubles are getting worse, our enemies watch and we have to fight, and that's what I'll do for you ...

We will carry Pennsylvania. ... We need your help. ... It's a close race, my friends,\\" he said. McCain also responded to Obama's assertions that his crowds are unruly and use dangerous language to describe the Illinois senator. \\"I cannot tell you about how proud I am of you,\\" he said. It was a line that he used in Wednesday night's debate. iReport.com: Obama survived knock-out punch. Obama and McCain are scheduled to speak Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith dinner, a political tradition that dates back to 1945. It honors the first Catholic ever nominated for president and was begun by Francis J. Spellman, the archbishop of New York's Roman Catholic Archdiocese at the time. The Republican presidential nominee will also appear on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman,\\" after canceling an earlier appearance, which left the host fuming. Also Thursday, McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, sounded a note of triumph about Wednesday's presidential debate while campaigning in Bangor, Maine. \\"They [Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden] look to the past because they'd rather run against the current administration, it sounds like, and that strategy though, thankfully, it's really starting to wear very very thin,\\" Palin said. \\"As John McCain reminded Barack Obama last night, if he wanted to run against George Bush, he had his chance four years ago. This year, the name on the ballot is John McCain -- and America knows that John McCain is his own man, he is the maverick.\\" Though Maine has trended Democratic for nearly two decades, the McCain campaign is making a push in the state's rural 2nd Congressional District, which is allotted one electoral vote independent of how the state votes at large. Despite the McCain camp's efforts, the Republican National Committee has stopped running advertisements in the state. Palin later traveled to Elon, North Carolina. At an afternoon rally at Elon University, near Greensboro, Palin pressed the audience to stand firm against accusations of negative campaigning, and told them to pay \\"close attention\\" to Obama's record. \\"It's not mean-spirited and it's not negative campaigning when you call someone out on their record,\\" she said. \\"So don't let anyone, don't let them make you believe that you're being negative or mean-spirited or unpatriotic or unfair when you are asking about somebody's record, OK?\\" After the rally, Palin continued on to a fundraiser at a home in Greensboro.

So, the answer is (II. yes) because the questions are the same in meaning."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas? Answer the above question based on the context below: Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted... The answer is:","response":"Massenet. Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet is the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas. He was a French composer of the Romantic era, best known for his operas. Massenet was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired."},{"question":"Consider the question.

For more than 30 years, I have seen a stream of tales about gender differences in brain structure under headlines that assure me that from birth men are innately more rational and better at map-reading than women, who are emotional, empathetic multi-taskers, useless at telling jokes. I am from Mars, apparently, while the ladies in my life are from Venus. And there are no signs that this flow is drying up, with last week witnessing publication of a particularly lurid example of the genre. Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia revealed they had used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to show that the neurons in men's brains are connected to each other in a very different way from neurons in women's brains. This point was even illustrated by the team, led by Professor Ragini Verma, with a helpful diagram. A male brain was depicted with its main connections – coloured blue, needless to say – running from the front to the back. Connections within cranial hemispheres were strong, but connections between the two hemispheres were weak. By contrast, the female brain had thick connections running from side to side with strong links between the two hemispheres. \\"These maps show us a stark difference in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks and women at others,\\" said Verma. The response of the press was predictable. Once again scientists had \\"proved\\" that from birth men have brains which are hardwired to give us better spatial skills, to leave us bereft of empathy for others, and to make us run, like mascara, at the first hint of emotion. Equally, the team had provided an explanation for the \\"fact\\" that women cannot use corkscrews or park cars but can remember names and faces better than males. It is all written in our neurons at birth. As I have said, I have read this sort of thing before. I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now. It is biological determinism at its silly, trivial worst. Yes, men and women probably do have differently wired brains, but there is little convincing evidence to suggest these variations are caused by anything other than cultural factors. Males develop improved spatial skills not because of an innate superiority but because they are expected and encouraged to be strong at sport, which requires expertise at catching and throwing. Similarly, it is anticipated that girls will be more emotional and talkative, and so their verbal skills are emphasised by teachers and parents. As the years pass, these different lifestyles produce variations in brain wiring – which is a lot more plastic than most biological determinists realise. This possibility was simply not addressed by Verma and her team. Equally, when gender differences are uncovered by researchers they are frequently found to be trivial, a point made by Robert Plomin, a professor of behavioural genetics at London's Institute of Psychiatry, whose studies have found that a mere 3% of the variation in young children's verbal development is due to their gender. \\"If you map the distribution of scores for verbal skills of boys and of girls, you get two graphs that overlap so much you would need a very fine pencil indeed to show the difference between them. Yet people ignore this huge similarity between boys and girls and instead exaggerate wildly the tiny difference between them. It drives me wild.\\" I should make it clear that Plomin made that remark three years ago when I last wrote about the issue of gender and brain wiring. It was not my first incursion, I should stress. Indeed, I have returned to the subject – which is an intriguing, important one – on a number of occasions over the years as neurological studies have been hyped in the media, often by the scientists who carried them out. It has taken a great deal of effort by other researchers to put the issue in proper perspective. A major problem is the lack of consistent work in the field, a point stressed to me in 2005 – during an earlier outbreak of brain-gender difference stories – by Professor Steve Jones, a geneticist at University College London, and author of Y: The Descent of Men. \\"Researching my book, I discovered there was no consensus at all about the science [of gender and brain structure],\\" he told me. \\"There were studies that said completely contradictory things about male and female brains. That means you can pick whatever study you like and build a thesis around it. The whole field is like that. It is very subjective. That doesn't mean there are no differences between the brains of the sexes, but we should take care not to exaggerate them.\\" Needless to say that is not what has happened over the years. Indeed, this has become a topic whose coverage has been typified mainly by flaky claims, wild hyperbole and sexism. It is all very depressing. The question is: why has this happened? Why is there such divergence in explanations for the differences in mental abilities that we observe in men and women? And why do so many people want to exaggerate them so badly? The first issue is the easier to answer. The field suffers because it is bedevilled by its extraordinary complexity. The human brain is a vast, convoluted edifice and scientists are only now beginning to develop adequate tools to explore it. The use of diffusion tensor imaging by Verma's team was an important breakthrough, it should be noted. The trouble is, once more, those involved were rash in their interpretations of their own work. \\"This study contains some important data but it has been badly overhyped and the authors must take some of the blame,\\" says Professor Dorothy Bishop, of Oxford University. \\"They talk as if there is a typical male and a typical female brain – they even provide a diagram – but they ignore the fact that there is a great deal of variation within the sexes in terms of brain structure. You simply cannot say there is a male brain and a female brain.\\" Even more critical is Marco Catani, of London's Institute of Psychiatry. \\"The study's main conclusions about possible cognitive differences between males and females are not supported by the findings of the study. A link between anatomical differences and cognitive functions should be demonstrated and the authors have not done so. They simply have no idea of how these differences in anatomy translate into cognitive attitudes. So the main conclusion of the study is purely speculative.\\" The study is also unclear how differences in brain architecture between the sexes arose in the first place, a point raised by Michael Bloomfield of the MRC's Clinical Science Centre. \\"An obvious possibility is that male hormones like testosterone and female hormones like oestrogen have different effects on the brain. A more subtle possibility is that bringing a child up in a particular gender could affect how our brains are wired.\\" In fact, Verma's results showed that the neuronal connectivity differences between the sexes increased with the age of her subjects. Such a finding is entirely consistent with the idea that cultural factors are driving changes in the brain's wiring. The longer we live, the more our intellectual biases are exaggerated and intensified by our culture, with cumulative effects on our neurons. In other words, the intellectual differences we observe between the sexes are not the result of different genetic birthrights but are a consequence of what we expect a boy or a girl to be. Why so many people should be so desperate to ignore or obscure this fact is a very different issue. In the end, I suspect it depends on whether you believe our fates are sealed at birth or if you think that it is a key part of human nature to be able to display a plasticity in behaviour and in ways of thinking in the face of altered circumstance. My money is very much on the latter. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The article argues that claims about inherent differences between male and female brains are often exaggerated and based on cultural expectations rather than biological determinism. While there may be some differences in how male and female brains are wired, these differences are likely influenced by upbringing and societal expectations. The author reminds readers that human brains are highly adaptable and should not be pigeonholed by gender stereotypes. The idea that men and women are \\"hardwired\\" for specific tasks is oversimplified, and more research is needed to understand the complex factors that influence brain development and function."},{"question":"Davy Jones is a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, portrayed by Bill Nighy.

Answer:","response":"In order to answer this question, let us first analyze the given process step by step and then assess the perturbation hypothesis and its possible effects on the cellular damage. Step 1: Contact is made with a virus - The virus encounters a human or animal host. Step 2: The virus enters the human or animal body - The virus penetrates the host's body through various routes of entry, such as inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, etc. Step 3: The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food - Viruses are specific to certain host cells and tissues, so the virus will travel to the part of the body where it can infect the cells it targets. Step 4: The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses - The virus will use host cell's materials and machinery to replicate itself. Step 5: The virus replicates and spreads - As the virus replicates, it will generate more copies of itself, which will then infect nearby cells and spread throughout the host's body. Step 6: The virus causes symptoms in the body as the immune system tries to expel the virus - The host's immune system will detect and try to eliminate the virus, causing inflammation and various symptoms in the process. Now, let us consider the perturbation hypothesis: Suppose heating the water takes less time. The hypothesis seems unrelated to the process of viral infection and replication. However, if we interpret the hypothesis as \\"suppose inactivating the virus takes less time,\\" we can explore its effect on cellular damage. In this case, if inactivating the virus takes less time, it could potentially slow down or halt the progression of the viral infection in the host. This would mean that fewer host cells would be damaged or destroyed during the viral replication process. The host's immune system may also have an easier time responding to and eliminating the virus, which could lead to milder symptoms or a faster recovery. In conclusion, if the perturbation hypothesis were related to inactivating the virus instead of heating water, it could have a direct effect on the process, leading to less cellular damage overall. However, as it stands, the perturbation hypothesis does not appear to have a direct or indirect effect on the process of viral infection, replication, and the associated cellular damage."},{"question":"You will be given a context, a subject and a relation.

Here's a question with a factual answer for you: Question: What is the process called in which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen? Answer: The process in which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions or the Calvin Cycle. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and involve the splitting of water molecules (photolysis), producing oxygen as a byproduct. The energy from sunlight is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are energy-rich molecules. The light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle, occur in the stroma of chloroplasts. During the Calvin Cycle, the energy provided by ATP and NADPH is utilized to fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into glucose molecules. This process consists of several chemical reactions, including carbon fixation, reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, regeneration of RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate), and the synthesis of glucose from the acquired glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules. Once formed, glucose can be used by plants for energy and growth or converted to other molecules like cellulose and starch for storage."},{"question":"LONG ISLANDERS - 'FELT I HAD A STORY TO TELL THE WORLD' - NYTimes.com ''ROCKY and I have known each other for about 36 years,'' said Ralph Corsel as he reminisced about the former middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano. ''One day - this must have been about five years ago - I said, 'Rocky, it's been over 20 years since your first book' -''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' -'came out.' ''So I said, 'Why don't you do another book?' I said, 'I'll do the book for you.' So he said, 'Yeah, go ahead, you want to do it?' He didn't know how involved I'd get with it.'' Mr. Corsel became involved with it to the point that the project is now reality in the form of ''Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,'' (12.95) by Rocky Graziano with Ralph Corsel, published by Stein & Day. ''I think I probably ran home and started that same day, doing an outline,'' said the 62-year-old Mr. Corsel, who divides his time between homes in Manhattan and East Quogue. To compose the biography - which recapitulates the fighter's troubled youth, including reformatory and prison terms, and takes him through his championship and beyond, into the realm of show business and marriage and celebrity friends and the counselling of delinquent youngsters and jail inmates - Mr. Corsel followed Mr. Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends and conducted research in files of old newspapers. ''It's a book about a man who came up as a poor kid and made it in life regardless of all the obstacles that were thrown in his path,'' Mr. Corsel said. ''There's something electrifying about the guy.'' When it comes to colorful lives, Mr. Corsel is no slouch himself. Starting out as Raffaelo Corsalini, the Bronx-born son of Italianimmigrant parents, he was - by his own account - a thief at the age of 9, a reformatory inmate as a teen-ager, a gun moll's boyfriend who worked in a bootlegging plant, and a Depression-era hobo and panhandler who trekked cross-country to California, where he tried to become a professional singer and became instead a pickpocket and confidence man. After Army service in World War II, he came east and worked as a bartender before establishing his own business as a manufacturer's agent. ''All of a sudden,'' he said of his adoption of the salesman's life, ''the money started pouring in like mad. I realized that nothing makes a man honest like money in the bank, and I lost all desire to do anything crooked.'' After a decade, he was able to let others handle his business for him. ''In the back of my mind, ever since I was very young, I always felt I wanted to write - probably because of the life I had led, my background as a kid. I felt I had a story to tell the world.'' Mr. Corsel, whose formal education had ended in the eighth grade (he spent a good many years reading while on the road as a salesman), enrolled in writing courses at the School of General Studies of Columbia University. Within weeks, he said, a short story he had written about his colorful youth prompted his teacher to encourage him to try a novel. The result was ''Up There the Stars,'' an autobiographical novel published in 1968. Mr. Corsel, who has been married twice and has a daughter, went on from here to write columns for Italian-American publications while keeping an eye on his business, traveling and pursuing his hobby of seeing what he can find while roaming here and there with a metal detector. Right now he's at work on a sequel to ''Up There the Stars.'' As for his biography of Mr. Graziano, he said: ''I put a message in the book, to give hope to kids like ourselves who came up out of the bottom of the barrel, to make them feel that if guys like Rocky and myself could make it, then regardless of the poverty and the background, there's always the possibility of making it. ''This is the most beautiful country in the world.'' Illustrations: Photo of Ralph Corsel What was this article about?","response":"This article is about Ralph Corsel, a writer who decided to write a biography for his friend, former middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano. Corsel and Graziano had known each other for many years, and with Graziano's approval, Corsel went on to write the book titled \\"Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,\\" published by Stein & Day. The book covers Graziano's life, from his troubled youth and time spent in reformatory and prison, to becoming a boxing champion, show business personality, and a counselor for delinquent youngsters and jail inmates. In the article, Corsel shares how he followed Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends, and conducted research in old newspaper files to compose the biography. He mentions that it is a story of a man who succeeded in life despite numerous obstacles. Corsel himself has led a colorful life, having been a thief, reformatory inmate, gun moll's boyfriend, bootlegging plant worker, hobo, and eventually a successful businessman. Corsel's affinity for writing began from a desire to share his story with the world, which led him to enroll in writing courses at Columbia University's School of General Studies. He then penned an autobiographical novel titled \\"Up There the Stars,\\" published in 1968, and continued to write columns for Italian-American publications while overseeing his business. Corsel is currently working on a sequel to his first novel and believes that his biography of Graziano serves as a message of hope for disadvantaged youth, proving that anyone can succeed with determination, regardless of their background."},{"question":"Definition: In this task you will be given a list of numbers.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity,\\" according to Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee?

Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for 2 per pound. To find out how much money he would make from selling one watermelon, we must multiply the weight of the watermelon by the price per pound: 23 pounds * 2/pound = 46 So, Farmer Kent would make 46 for selling one watermelon. Now, we need to find out how much money he would make for selling 18 watermelons.

Put them together and, believe it or not, you have an art project that is judged to be worth £50,000 of taxpayers’ money. Artist Simon Faithfull bought the 24ft Brioney Victoria on eBay for £75. He lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire, then opened its valves, filling it with water. As it sank, he dived into the sea. And the point of this performance? The boat had been fitted with underwater cameras, which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the Dorset coast. Footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live, and will later be made into a film. Scroll down for video. Dramatic display: British artist Simon Faithfull leaps from the side of the concrete fishing boat as it begins to sink off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset. He set off smoke bombs to make it look like the vessel was on fire. The REEF project will cost £120,000, nearly half funded by the Arts Council. The rest will come from European Union grants. Mr Faithfull, 48, the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: ‘A boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one.’ REEF was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, groups supported by the Arts Council. It cost £80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts, of which £32,000 came from the Arts Council. An extra £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton and France, of which the Council will pay half. The boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12-month journey of the ‘dead’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life. The footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions. But the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the British taxpayer through grants from the Arts Council. It was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, two arts organisations in Brighton supported by the Arts Council.The remaining cost has come through European Union arts grants. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art. 'If this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought. This sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end.' Going under: The ship dips below the waves. Five underwater cameras have been attached to the vessel to document the 'dead' ship's journey over the next year as it becomes an artificial reef for marine life. The project, called REEF, has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required. Mr Faithfull, who is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: 'The idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea. 'I bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on eBay then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat. We had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful. 'I was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble. 'Then I opened the seacocks and let water into the boat. As it went down I dived off to symbolise abandoning ship. He explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef. The cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in Brighton, Calais and Caen in France. Of the £120,000 that the project cost, £80,000 went into buying, building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts. Of that money, £32,000 was funded by the Arts Council with the rest being met by grants from Interreg, a scheme funded by the European Regional Development Fund to encourage European projects to work together. A further £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton, Caen and Calais, half of which will be met by the Arts Council and half by Interreg. Creative family: Simon Faithfull, pictured left, is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, pictured right earlier this year. One of his recent art projects involved him walking through a burning plane. Laurence Hill from Fabrica, one of the main backers of the project, added: 'Eventually there will be an exhibition at Fabrica with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking. 'In was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it. It was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it.

Include other facets of her career: Besides being a singer, Streisand has also appeared in various films and even directed some herself. As these also contribute to her fame and impact on the entertainment world, we should mention her roles as an \\"actress\\" and \\"filmmaker.\\" 4. Specify her nationality: In order to provide more context about her background, adding \\"American\\" to her description is helpful so that users can get an idea of where she is from and the entertainment industry she has primarily worked in. Putting it all together, we have a succinct but informative answer that captures the essence of who Barbra Streisand is: \\"Barbra Streisand is a famous American singer, actress, and filmmaker.\\""},{"question":"Question: Where was Angela's purse stolen? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Net Context: United States Secretary of Defense Michael Bergstrom (Ken Howard) commits suicide after being informed that he has tested positive for HIV. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is a systems analyst from Venice, California who telecommutes to Cathedral Software in San Francisco. Her interpersonal relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother (Diane Baker), who is institutionalized with Alzheimer's disease and often forgets who Bennett is. Bennett's co-worker Dale sends her a floppy disk with a backdoor labeled \\"Ï\\" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called \\"Gatekeeper\\" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but Dale's private plane's navigation system malfunctions and sends the plane into a tower, killing him. Bennett travels to Cozumel, Mexico on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam). After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a mugger to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the foliage and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting him. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's dinghy collides with rocks, destroying the disk and hospitalizing her. She is unconscious for three days. When Bennett wakes up, she finds that all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room, her car is no longer at the LAX parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is empty and listed for sale. Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett's Social Security number is now assigned to a \\"Ruth Marx,\\" for whom Devlin has entered arrest record by hacking police records. When Bennett calls her desk at Cathedral, an impostor answers and offers Bennett her old life back in... The answer to this question is:","response":"Angela's purse was stolen in Cozumel, Mexico, while she was on vacation. This happened during a walk along the beach with Jack Devlin, who had arranged for a mugger to steal her purse. Devlin then chased the mugger into the foliage, retrieved the floppy disk from the purse, and killed the mugger."},{"question":"14:14 David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them.

The night Geoff Hunt killed his family before taking his own life his wife Kim had raged at him about finances, claiming one of her husband's brothers was stealing from the family trust. An inquest into the deaths of Lockhart farmer Geoff, nurse Kim and their children Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8, and Phoebe, 6, is taking place this week. A forensic psychologist told the inquest it's likely the farmer primarily wanted to kill himself due to his depression and a total loss of hope. However, he may have decided to kill his family as he believed they were dependent on him and he thought 'he would spare them future pain'. His use of a gun to inflict a single fatal injury also indicates he did not wish to inflict pain on his wife and children, the psychologist said.Inquest into brutal deaths of the Hunt family in rural NSW began TuesdayPolice say Geoff Hunt, 44, killed wife, Kim, and their three young childrenHearing told Hunt blamed himself for the brutal murders in a suicide noteKim struggled with physical and mental issues after near-fatal car accidentThe father packed his children's lunches for school next day in final hoursState Coroner Michael will preside over four days of hearings in NSWTragic shooting took place in Lockhart, NSW, on September 9, 2014 Question:The evidence suggests Mr Hunt gunned his wife down in the driveway of their property in the _ before walking inside his house and shooting each of his children dead as they lay in their bed.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Passage: Hynde, originally from Akron, Ohio, moved to London in 1973, working at the weekly music paper NME and at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's clothes store. She was involved with early versions of the Clash and the Damned and played in short-lived bands such as Masters of the Backside (1976) and the Moors Murderers (1978 lineup). The Pretenders formed in 1978 after Dave Hill at Anchor Records heard some demos of Hynde's music. He arranged a rehearsal studio in Denmark Street, where a three-piece band consisting of Hynde, Mal Hart on bass (he had played with Hynde and Steve Strange in the Moors Murderers), and Phil Taylor of Motörhead on drums played a selection of Hynde's original songs. Dave Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough \\"star potential\\" to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records. Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\". Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers. Hynde named the band \\"The Pretenders\\" after the Platters song \\"The Great Pretender\\", which was the favourite song of one of her former boyfriends.

Options: - talk to each other - cook food - demand justice - learn from each other - share food Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"When people think some wrongdoing has occurred in government, they usually react by demanding justice. This means that they voice their concerns about the perceived injustice, address authorities, and seek ways to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Explanation: Talking to each other: While people may discuss the incident amongst themselves, this option doesn't necessarily suggest a course of action that directly addresses the wrongdoing. Cooking food: This is irrelevant to addressing a perceived wrongdoing in government. Demanding justice: This is the most appropriate reaction in this context. It indicates that individuals will actively seek resolution, transparency, and correction of the perceived injustice. This might involve actions such as protests, campaigns, petitions, or contacting representatives to express their concerns. Learning from each other: Although there may be valuable lessons to learn from discussing instances of government wrongdoing, this doesn't address the issue directly. Sharing food: Like \\"cooking food,\\" this option also lacks relevance to addressing wrongdoing in government. In summary, when people think there is a wrongdoing in government, they often react by demanding justice to hold those responsible accountable, and seek change to correct the injustice."},{"question":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.\\" Answer: A:","response":"According to the 1912 compromise in China, Yuan Shikai emerged as the foremost head of state in the country. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China, the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen assumed the role of the first Provisional President in Nanjing. However, the power dynamics within the country were more complex at that time, with Yuan Shikai controlling the Beiyang Army, the most powerful military force in China. Yuan Shikai wielded significant influence and had the ability to destabilize the newly formed republic by inciting a civil war or provoking foreign intervention. Thus, to prevent such disastrous outcomes and maintain stability in the delicate political climate, the leaders of the Republic of China reluctantly agreed to the Beiyang Army's demand that the country be united under a Beijing government, with Yuan Shikai at the helm. As a result, on March 10, 1912, in Beijing, Yuan Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China, effectively becoming the head of state. Although Sun Yat-sen was the initial leader and a prominent revolutionary figure, the 1912 compromise resulted in Yuan Shikai emerging as the predominant head of state in China due to his military strength and political maneuvering. Yuan Shikai's presidency, however, was marked by his attempts to centralize power and establish himself as a dictator, ultimately leading to instability and contributing to the Warlord Era that followed.

One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.

A:","response":"Tristram of Lyonesse and William Morris are related through their roles in the realm of literature and arts, particularly in the context of medievalism and the romantic movement. Tristram of Lyonesse, a mythical knight and hero from the Arthurian legend, is a character drawn from British and French medieval literature. He is most famously depicted in the romantic tale \\"Tristan and Iseult,\\" where he falls in love with the Irish princess Iseult, who is betrothed to Tristram's uncle, King Mark of Cornwall. William Morris, on the other hand, was an influential 19th-century English poet, novelist, and artist who contributed significantly to the revival of medieval and romantic themes in literature and art. He was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of artists who rejected the neoclassical tradition, seeking inspiration from medieval stories, legends, and aesthetics. Given Morris's interests and stylistic influences, it is no surprise that the legend of Tristram of Lyonesse would capture his imagination. Although William Morris did not directly write about Tristram of Lyonesse, his works were heavily influenced by myth, legend, and the medieval period, which includes the Arthurian lore in which Tristram is a prominent character. Thus, the connection between Tristram of Lyonesse and William Morris lies in the latter's fascination, adaptation, and revival of the medieval and romantic themes that pervade the tales surrounding the former."},{"question":"UK imports at record high The UK's trade gap widens sharply from 4.4bn to 5.3bn, as imports hit 21.5bn, the highest monthly level since records began.

When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me mad. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration. The acting was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN, we don't see it. I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. When Pierre, Cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different. I might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing. The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep up with films like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right, but CU didn't capture and hold onto the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. It has an air of pretension in its 'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing, figure it out for yourself' presentation. It's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.

Title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity.

Here's how I deduce this: - Firstly, we start from the premise that workouts usually take place in close or confined spaces where many people do exercises simultaneously. - The speaker mentions being kicked 'just as they pulled up', indicating that they were perhaps in a state of motion. - The user's phrase 'someone jumped over me' infers that another person was also doing exercises in the same vicinity and possibly lost control, misjudged their jump or didn't see the user, leading to the collision with the speaker's head. Therefore, the most likely reason the speaker was kicked in the head during the workout is accidentality due to a lack of space or a miscalculated movement from another person in the workout area."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: HOTEL INFORMATION 3800 W.

Threatened with frostbite and pneumonia, he is coerced into divulging intelligence to his German interrogator.He and many other Americans are later transferred by train to a prisoner of war camp. While en route, a flight of P-51 Mustangs attack the station. Since the painted letters POW on the top of the train are covered by thick snow, the Mustangs fire on the train, causing some of the POWs to be killed by friendly fire. To save themselves, the POWs leave the train, spell POW with their bodies, and prevent further strafing.After arriving at the camp, Hart is debriefed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it.

Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Dominica 'in a daze' after Hurricane Maria leaves island cut off from world Read more Maria, now a category 3 storm with winds of 115 mph, is currently lashing the Dominican Republic as is it passes to its north and is expected to move near the Turks and Caicos later on Thursday. It previously hit the islands of Dominica, Guadeloupe and the US territory of St Croix, where Donald Trump has declared a major disaster. “Once we’re able to go outside, we’re going to find our island destroyed,” warned Abner Gomez, Puerto Rico’s emergency management director. “The information we have received is not encouraging.” The storm made landfall early on Wednesday morning with winds of 155mph (250kph). Residents said roofs were torn off buildings and doors flew off their hinges. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rossello, ordered a curfew every night until Saturday, from 6pm until 6am, saying the move was essential to maintain order. “Remain in safe places,” Rosello said. Emergency personnel, health workers and reporters are exempt.

People took cover in stairwells, bathrooms and closets as trees and communication towers were knocked down in the storm. Felix Delgado, mayor of the northern coastal city of Catano, told the Associated Press that 80% of the 454 homes in a neighborhood known as Juana Matos were destroyed. “Months and months and months and months are going to pass before we can recover from this,” he said. Mike Brennan, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, said Maria would remain “a major, very dangerous hurricane” for the next couple of days and that rainfall would be a problem even after the center of the hurricane moved away from the island. Federal officials were reporting that all energy customers in Puerto Rico had been left without power late on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) told the Guardian. Where is Hurricane Maria heading? Mapping the storm's path Read more The executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration (PRFAA), Carlos Mercader, said there were 13,000 evacuees in Puerto Rico’s shelters. This includes people who evacuated from other islands during Hurricane Irma. In a meeting broadcast online on Wednesday morning, Mercader warned power was expected to shut down. Because of this, he said, his administration was prioritizing getting generators to help power hospitals, schools, the water system and flood pumps. “In order to help with the floodings, we need electricity,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Rossello warned the country would lose “a lot of infrastructure”. Homes built after 2011 – when the island, a US territory, introduced newer construction codes – could survive the winds but those in flood-prone areas “have no chance”, he said. Maria is the first category 4 hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1932. As Puerto Rico residents braced for the storm on Tuesday, Trump sent a message of support on Twitter: “Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane,” he said. “Be careful, our hearts are with you – will be there to help!” Residents of the British Virgin Islands told the Guardian that it was hard to tell how badly the islands had been hit because the damage inflicted by Hurricane Irma was so fresh. Communication with the territory remained patchy, and a strict curfew was being enforced. The hurricane was still category 5 early Wednesday morning when it pummeled St Croix, the largest and southernmost of the US Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe, where at least one person died and about 40% of homes were without power in the aftermath of the storm.

Communications with the island were severely disrupted and inhabitants were only able to make contact with the outside world using shortwave radios. At least seven people died there, according to Hartley Henry, a chief aid to the prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit. Henry gave an update on the impact of the hurricane after speaking to Skerrit, who he said expected the death toll to increase as they received more information from rural communities. Henry said: “The country is in a daze – no electricity, no running water – as a result of uprooted pipes in most communities and definitely to landline or cellphone services on island, and that will be for quite a while.” ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Gadi Schwartz, Alex Johnson and Daniel Arkin SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Hurricane Maria is likely to have \\"destroyed\\" Puerto Rico, the island's emergency director said Wednesday after the monster storm ripped roofs off buildings and flooded homes. Intense flooding was reported across the economically strained U.S. territory, particularly in San Juan, the capital, where many residential streets looked like rivers. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the entire island shortly after 12:30 a.m. ET. Yennifer Álvarez Jaimes, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's press secretary, told NBC News that all power across the island was knocked out. \\"Once we're able to go outside, we're going to find our island destroyed,\\" Emergency Management Director Abner Gómez Cortés said at a news briefing. Rosselló imposed a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, citing flood warnings and the importance of keeping streets clear for repair and rescue teams. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz told MSNBC that the devastation in the capital was unlike any she had ever seen. \\"The San Juan that we knew yesterday is no longer there,\\" Yulín said, adding: \\"We're looking at four to six months without electricity\\" in Puerto Rico, home to nearly 3.5 million people. Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, had maximum sustained winds of 155 mph when it made landfall as a Category 4 storm near the town of Yabucoa just after 6 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said. After weakening, Maria strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday, it added. By 2 a.m. ET, it was about 55 miles north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Tropical storm conditions were expected to continue on Puerto Rico through the night, but hurricane warnings for the island were lifted late Wednesday as Maria moved away from its the northwest coast. \\"The wind threat has decreased,\\" the hurricane center said, but the threat of rain-gorged floods remains \\"devastating to catastrophic,\\" it said. Airports in San Juan, Aguadilla and Ponce were ordered closed until Friday at the earliest because of flooding and debris, authorities said. \\"Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and rescues,\\" the agency said. \\"Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks in many places with deep moving water.\\" Rosanna Cerezo, a lawyer and radio host in metro San Juan, said the city was deluged. It sounded as though bombs were going off when the wind toppled trees around her house, she said. Along the beachfront, she said, cement structures had been wrenched from their foundations as islanders scrambled for refuge. \\"Rooftops collapsed, windows shattered,\\" Cerezo said in a text message. \\"People are huddled in hallways, closets, bathrooms.\\" Maria's next move was expected to take it near the coasts of the Dominican Republic and the Turks & Caicos islands, which were under hurricane warnings, and then begin drifting more northwestward by Friday. Forecasters said it remained too early to know how close Maria will move to the U.S. mainland, but Domenica Davis, a meteorologist for The Weather Channel, said, \\"It looks like it will stay in the open waters of the Atlantic.\\" Puerto Rico was already struggling to dig itself out of a historic financial crisis. Maria could destroy any progress the territory has made under a year-old economic rehab plan ─ and set it back further. Maria was a Category 5 hurricane — the strongest there is — when it hit the Caribbean on Monday night, killing at least seven people on the island of Dominica and one person on Guadeloupe.

(AP Photo/Tatiana Fernandez) (Associated Press) SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The Latest on Hurricane Maria (all times local): 5 a.m. Hurricane Maria is lashing the northeastern Dominican Republic early Thursday and is expected to pass near the Turks and Caicos later in the day. The Category 3 storm's maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 kph) and the U.S. National Hurricane Center says some strengthening is possible during the next day or so. Maria, which has killed at least 10 people across the Caribbean, is centered about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and is moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph). Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans are rebuilding after the hurricane slammed into the U.S. territory Wednesday, crushing concrete balconies and paralyzing the island with landslides, flooding and downed trees. ___ 3:30 a.m. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans stunned by a hurricane that crushed concrete balconies and paralyzed the island with landslides, flooding and downed trees vowed to slowly rebuild amid an economic crisis as rescue crews fanned out across the U.S. territory. The extent of the damage is unknown given that dozens of municipalities remain isolated and without communication after Maria hit the island Wednesday morning as a Category 4 storm with 155 mph winds, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in over 80 years. Uprooted trees and widespread flooding blocked many highways and streets across the island, creating a maze that forced drivers to go against traffic and past police cars that used loudspeakers to warn people they must respect a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed by the governor to ensure everyone's safety. ||||| SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Hurricane Maria, the second major storm to ravage the Caribbean in a month, skirted past the Turks and Caicos Islands on Friday, leaving devastation in its wake that included fresh flooding on Puerto Rico two days after pummeling the U.S. island territory. Maria, which ranked as the most powerful hurricane to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, has killed at least six people there and claimed 19 lives on several other Caribbean islands, according to government officials and local news media accounts. But even as Puerto Ricans struggled without electricity to clean up and dig out from tangles of rubble, uprooted trees and fallen power lines, another potential disaster was unfolding in northwestern corner of the island, where a dam was on the verge of collapse. The U.S. National Weather Service warned in a series of bulletins that the dam on the rain-engorged Guajataca River, was failing, causing flash flooding in the area and prompting an evacuation of communities below the reservoir by way of buses. Roughly 70,000 people live in the area downstream from the earthen dam that was under evacuation, the island’s governor, Ricardo Rossello, said in a late-afternoon news conference. Christina Villalba, an official for the island’s emergency management agency, said there was little doubt the dam would give way. “It could be tonight, it could be tomorrow, it could be in the next few days, but it’s very likely it will be soon,” she said, adding that authorities were aiming to complete evacuations Friday night. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and cut a path of destruction through the center of the island on Wednesday, ripping roofs from buildings and triggering widespread flooding. Torrential downpours from the storm sent several rivers to record levels. Officials in Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million inhabitants, confirmed six storm-related fatalities: three from landslides in Utuado, in the island’s mountainous center; two from drowning in Toa Baja, west of San Juan, and a person near San Juan who was struck by a piece of wind-blown lumber. Earlier news media reports had put the island’s death toll as high as 15. “We know of other potential fatalities through unofficial channels that we haven’t been able to confirm,” said Hector Pesquera, the government’s secretary of public safety. In and around San Juan, the capital, people worked to clear debris from the streets on Friday, some working with machetes, while others began to reopen businesses, though they wondered how long they could operate without power and limited inventory. “There’s no water, no power, nothing,” said Rogelio Jimenez, a 34-year-old pizzeria worker.

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas Motorists lined up for hours outside the few gasoline stations that were open. “I’ve been here for three and a bit hours,” said Angel Serra, sitting in a blocks-long line hoping to fill up his tank. Long lines also formed at the handful of automated teller machines that appeared to be working in the region. DAMAGE ESTIMATED AT 45 BLN Puerto Rico was already facing the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history. A team of judges overseeing its bankruptcy has advised involved parties to put legal proceedings on hold indefinitely as the island recovers, said a source familiar with the proceedings. The storm was expected to tally 45 billion in damage and lost economic activity across the Caribbean, with at least 30 billion of that in Puerto Rico, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler at Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia. Slideshow (20 Images) Elsewhere in the Caribbean, 14 deaths were reported on Dominica, an island nation of 71,000 inhabitants. Two people were killed in the French territory of Guadeloupe and one in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two people died when the storm roared past the Dominican Republic on Thursday, according to local media outlet El Jaya. Maria churned past Turks and Caicos and was 295 miles (480 km) east of the Bahamas by 8 p.m. EDT (midnight GMT) on Friday, the NHC said. It was packing sustained winds of up to 125 miles per hour (205 km per hour), making it a Category 3 hurricane, but was expected to gradually weaken over the next two days as it turned more sharply to the north. Officials on Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory, had ordered residents to remain indoors and businesses to close on Friday as the hurricane neared, bringing a storm surge of as much as 12 feet (3.7 meters) above normal tide levels. But hurricane warnings were later canceled as Maria passed. Storm swells driven by Maria were expected to reach the southeastern coast of the U.S mainland on Friday, the NHC said, adding that it was too soon to determine what, if any, other direct effects it would have. In the Dominican Republic, Maria damaged nearly 3,000 homes and sent more than 9,300 to shelters, local emergency response agencies reported. Maria passed close by the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix, home to about 55,000 people, early Wednesday, knocking out electricity and most mobile phone service. Maria hit about two weeks after Hurricane Irma pounded two other U.S. Virgin Islands: St. Thomas and St. John. The islands’ governor, Kenneth Mapp, said it was possible that St. Thomas and St. Croix might reopen to some cruise liner traffic in a month. Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and the United States. It followed Harvey, which also killed more than 80 people when it struck Texas in late August and caused flooding in Houston. More than two months remain in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, although the busiest period is generally from mid-August to mid-October. ||||| Read the latest on Hurricane Maria with Friday’s live updates. Puerto Rico remained in the throes of chaos and devastation Thursday as the remnants of Hurricane Maria continued to dump rain on the island — up to three feet in some areas. Flash flood warnings persisted, according to the National Hurricane Center, with “catastrophic” flooding “especially in areas of mountainous terrain.” The strikingly powerful storm had rendered an estimated 3.4 million people without power, and with the territory’s energy grid all but destroyed, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló predicted a long period of recovery. Anxious relatives in the mainland United States and elsewhere took to social media in an effort to find news of their loved ones. Late Thursday, the mayor of Toa Baja, a town in northern Puerto Rico, told The New York Times that eight people had drowned there after flooding. That brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb. Puerto Rico faces numerous obstacles as it begins to emerge from the storm: the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis; a recovery process begun after Irma, which killed at least three people and left nearly 70 percent of households without power; the difficulty of getting to an island far from the mainland; and the strain on relief efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other groups already spread thin in the wake of several recent storms. “Irma gave us a break, but Maria destroyed us,” said Edwin Serrano, a construction worker in Old San Juan. The storm churned off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic as a Category 3 hurricane on Thursday, and the National Hurricane Center repeated hurricane warnings for late Thursday and early Friday morning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos. ||||| SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Hurricane Maria delivered a destructive full-body blow to this U.S. territory on Wednesday, ripping off metal roofs, generating terrifying and potentially lethal flash floods, knocking out 100 percent of the island’s electrical grid and decimating some communities. With sustained winds of 155 mph at landfall — a strong Category 4 storm and nearly a Category 5 — Maria was so powerful that it disabled radar, weather stations and cell towers across Puerto Rico, leaving an information vacuum in which officials could only speculate about property damage, injuries or deaths. “Definitely Puerto Rico — when we can get outside — we will find our island destroyed,” Abner Gómez, director of Puerto Rico’s emergency management agency, said in a midday news conference here. “The information we have received is not encouraging. It’s a system that has destroyed everything it has had in its path.” The entire island experienced hurricane conditions, with 20 inches or more of rain falling, often at torrential rates of up to seven inches per hour, leadi ng to reports of raging floodwaters and people seeking help to escape them. The storm, having passed through the U.S. Virgin Islands earlier, made landfall on the Puerto Rican coast near Yabucoa at 6:15 a.m. It was the first Category 4 storm to strike the island directly since 1932. By midmorning, Maria had fully engulfed the 100-mile-long island. [ Capital Weather Gang: Tracking Maria ] Winds snapped palm trees, shredded homes and sent debris skidding across beaches and roads. Recreational boats sank in San Juan’s marinas. Across the island, residents reported trees downed and blocking roadways. Far inland, floodwaters inundated homes that had never before flooded. In San Juan, the capital, Maria shook buildings and blew out windows. Residents of high-rise apartments sought refuge in bathrooms. First responders, including a fire-rescue team deployed from Fairfax, Va., had to ride out the storm for hours before emerging to help people. In the meantime, calls to emergency services went in vain. A family in the southern coastal town of Guayama, for example, reportedly pleaded for help as they were trapped in their home with rising water. In Hato Rey, a San Juan business district, a woman sought assistance as she was experiencing labor pains. “Unfortunately, our staff cannot leave,” Gómez said at the news conference. “They will be rescued later.” Macarena Gil Gandia, a resident of Hato Rey, helped her mother clean out water that had started flooding the kitchen of her second-floor apartment at dawn. “There are sounds coming from all sides,” Gil Gandia said in a text message. “The building is moving! And we’re only on the second floor, imagine the rest!” Farther west, in the community of Juana Matos, in the city of Catano, 80 percent of the structures were destroyed, the mayor of Catano told El Nuevo Día. “The area is completely flooded. Water got into the houses. The houses have no roof,” the mayor said. “Most of them are made of wood and zinc, and electric poles fell on them.” William “Brock” Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told The Washington Post that rescue and recovery operations are poised to help the U.S. territories — and had significant resources already deployed in the area as a result of Hurricane Irma, which hit the region just days ago. “Right now we’re in wait-and-see mode,” Long said Wednesday afternoon. “We know that St. Croix took a tremendous hit, and we know obviously Puerto Rico took the brunt of the storm. Once the weather clears and the seas die down, we’ll be in full operation.” Satellite images showed that Maria became disorganized, without a defined eye, and weakened as it moved slowly across the high terrain of Puerto Rico. Late Wednesday afternoon, the center of the vast storm exited the north coast of the island, its peak winds having dropped to 110 mph as a dangerous but less powerful Category 2 storm. As Maria journeys across open Atlantic waters, it is expected to reorganize and gain strength. It is moving parallel to the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic, heading toward the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.

Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post) The storm track and atmospheric conditions suggest it will stay offshore of the U.S. East Coast and eventually curve northeast and out to sea. But forecasters warn that it is too soon to say with certainty that the U.S. mainland is in the clear. Southern New England already is dealing with pounding surf and powerful wind gusts from Hurricane Jose. That storm could help in keeping Maria away from the coast by drawing it to the northeast. If Jose weakens too quickly, Maria could drift closer to the East Coast by the middle of next week. Maria was the most violent tropical cyclone to hit Puerto Rico in more than 80 years. It had raked St. Croix hours earlier, just two weeks after that island was the only major land mass in the U.S. Virgin Islands that was spared Hurricane Irma’s wrath. Maria also produced flooding in St. Thomas, an island that Irma hit. In the French island of Guadeloupe, officials blamed at least two deaths on Maria, and at least two people were missing after a ship went down near the tiny French island of Desirade. At least seven deaths have been reported on the devastated island of Dominica. Del. Stacey Plaskett, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands in Washington, said St. Croix had been a staging ground for relief efforts after Hurricane Irma devastated other parts of her district before Maria’s eye skimmed the edge of St. Croix on Tuesday night as a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph. The damage has yet to be fully assessed, but in a sign of the possible devastation, Plaskett said the roof of the local racetrack blew into the runway of the airport, complicating relief efforts. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló on Wednesday afternoon imposed a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for the general public, which will continue until Saturday. “Resist, Puerto Rico,” the governor tweeted earlier as the storm blew in. “God is with us; we are stronger than any hurricane. Together we will lift up.” Speaking on NBC’s “Today” show Wednesday, Rosselló said, “This is clearly going to be the most devastating storm in the history of our island.” Buildings that meet the island’s newer construction codes, established around 2011, should have been able to weather the winds, Rosselló said. But wooden homes in flood-prone areas “have no chance,” he predicted. The last hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico was Georges in 1998. Just one Category 5 hurricane has hit Puerto Rico in recorded history, in 1928. Broken windows at an apartment in the Ciudadela complex of Santurce. (Photo by Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post) Puerto Rico’s vulnerability to tropical cyclones has been driven home in the past two weeks as first Irma and then Maria have howled into the Caribbean. The back-to-back nature of the storms has had one minor upside: Some 3,200 federal government staffers, National Guardsmen and other emergency personnel overseen already were in Puerto Rico when Maria approached. President Trump praised FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security for “lifesaving and life-sustaining” work in the islands, and he sent his thoughts and prayers to “all those in harm’s way,” according to a White House statement. Late Wednesday, Trump issued a message on Twitter naming the Puerto Rican governor, adding: “We are with you and the people of Puerto Rico. Stay safe! #PRStrong.” The federal recovery effort, FEMA administrator Long said, will attempt to restore power to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as quickly as possible but in a way that makes the grid less vulnerable to similar disruptions. The power grid, he said, “is a fragile system in both territories. It’s going to be a long and frustrating process to get the power grid up.” In the lobby of Ciqala Luxury Home Suites in Miramar, a neighborhood in San Juan, Maria Gil de Lamadrid waited with her husband as the rain and wind pounded the hotel’s facade. The door of the hotel’s parking garage flopped violently in the wind. Hurricane Maria passed through Puerto Rico leaving behind a path of destruction. (Photo by Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post) Gil de Lamadrid had spent the night in the hotel after evacuating her nearby 16th floor waterfront apartment. But even in a luxury hotel room, Gil de Lamadrid could not evade flooding. On Wednesday morning, water began seeping into her room through the balcony doors. “I’m feeling anxious,” she said. Her husband shrugged. “For me, it’s an adventure,” he said. “Something to talk about later.” By midafternoon, the gusts had become less frequent, and lashing rains had eased. Soon residents emerged to survey the damage from a storm for the ages. Some walked their dogs. “The hotels, they lost all the windows, they had structural damage even on concrete,” reported Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo, a freelance photographer working for The Washington Post, as he surveyed the tourist area of San Juan. “Trees are without a single leaf.” In Miramar, residents began clearing the roads of larger trees. One man walked down the street wearing only a T-shirt, shorts and a fedora hat, beaming despite the rain. “I was bored,” he said. The Nieves Acarón family decided to walk their dogs just before nightfall. “He couldn’t last any longer,” Adriana Acarón said, pointing at her dog, Toffee. She had been anxious throughout the storm. With cellphone reception down, she had not yet heard from her mother-in-law, who is 83 and lives in an area where a river reportedly overflowed its banks. “It didn’t stop for hours,” she said of the storm. “I could feel everything. You could feel things flying at your window shutters.” Residents of San Juan take refuge at Roberto Clemente Coliseum, the biggest shelter in the island. (Photo by Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post) In the San Juan district of Santurce, residents used machetes to cut branches from trees blocking the road. The sidewalks were rendered impassable by downed trees, metal roofing and power lines. Anton Rosarios, 81, looked over what remained of the front of his wooden house, the walls of which had collapsed, exposing the interior. He said he was hoping that FEMA would show up: “They are the only ones who can help fix this neighborhood. God willing, they will be coming to help us soon.” The home of his neighbor, Vitin Rodriguez, 55, had lost its roof, and all of his belongings had been ruined by Maria. A tree had fallen and crushed his car, and he said he had no way to check on the status of family members. Further down the block, a small crowd gathered at an emergency shelter, as residents checked on friends and neighbors, some of whom had ridden out the storm playing dominoes. “It’s important to help, to give a life to people who don’t have homes because of the storm,” said Eudalia Sanata, 46, one of the four employees of the shelter. “Look, there are even a few dogs here. Dogs are part of the family, too, and no one wants to leave their family out in the rain.” 1 of 88 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hurricane Maria devastates Puerto Rico View Photos The storm has left widespread destruction along its path, including some areas battered earlier by the huge Hurricane Irma.

(CNN) -- Remember the time United Airlines broke a guitar? Dave Carroll does. He's the musician who three years ago turned his misfortune into an Internet sensation. His video, \\"United Breaks Guitars,\\" got a million views in just four days and prompted the airline to offer him compensation. But despite struggling with the airline for months, Carroll turned down the money because he wanted something bigger: he wanted to reform the system. Carroll is not the first angry customer to take his complaints online. Rants abound on video sharing sites; many feature nothing more than the offended party on a webcam spinning a tale of woe. That's what made Carroll's video stand out. The Canadian crooner spent seven months putting together a song and video. His real time and real talent combined to make something that people could really enjoy. After months of struggling with United, that's what","response":"Carroll decided to focus on – creating a positive change within the airline industry and raising awareness about customer rights. His video continued to gain popularity, and eventually sparked a conversation on social media and major news outlets. People from around the world started sharing their own experiences with airlines, leading to the rise of a collective voice demanding better customer service. As a result, United Airlines and other major airlines began implementing changes to improve customer relations. United started by training their staff to handle complaints more effectively, focusing on communication and empathy. They also invested in better technology to assist with baggage tracking and handling, resulting in a significant decrease in incidents like Carroll's broken guitar. Other airlines, seeing the power of social media and inspired by Dave Carroll's video, began to reevaluate their own customer service practices. Many started implementing customer service training programs and creating social media channels dedicated to handling complaints promptly and efficiently. Governments and aviation regulatory bodies also took notice of the situation and began implementing stricter regulations to protect customers' rights. Dave Carroll, in the meantime, continued to use his platform to advocate for better customer service across different industries. He wrote a book about his experience called \\"United Breaks Guitars: The Power of One Voice in the Age of Social Media,\\" which became a best-seller. He also started a consulting firm, empowering companies to improve their customer service practices and monetize their customer relationships. As the years go by, the power of social media in holding companies accountable becomes undeniable, and Dave Carroll’s story is now considered a turning point. The situation not only transformed himself into an influential public figure, but also brought to light the importance of treating customers with respect and dignity. In the end, the legacy of \\"United Breaks Guitars\\" is a story of perseverance, revolution, and change. It is a reminder of how the power of one voice can impact an entire industry and how technology can turn an angry customer's lament into a force for good. Today, while the airline industry still has room for improvement, many aspects of customer service have significantly improved, all thanks to Dave Carroll and his relentless pursuit for change."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: what are superannuation contributions?

Isner, an affable American eager to be known as more than tennis’s marathon man, came back intent on writing a new chapter to his career. They are fierce competitors but will be remembered forevermore as collaborators on one of the most memorable stories in Wimbledon history. In 2010, Isner needed more than 11 hours to separate himself from Mahut, who succumbed, 70-68, in the fifth set. By comparison, Isner’s 7-6 (4), 6-2, 7-6 (6) victory in the sequel, which ran 2 hours 3 minutes, was prosaic. In fading daylight, he secured a berth in the second round when Mahut hit an errant forehand on the second match point. “I’m just really thrilled to have won that third set,” Isner said, “because if I lose that third set, then chances are we don’t finish. You know, our match goes to a second day.” The six-time champion Roger Federer also advanced, as did the three-time runner-up Andy Roddick. Marcos Baghdatis, the No. 32 seed, barely thwarted the upset bid of James Blake, whose ranking has fallen outside the top 100, winning, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 4-6, 6-4. On the women’s side, the winners included the top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki and the 2004 champion Maria Sharapova. First-round matches are fret-filled exercises, but for Isner, who is 6 feet 9 inches with the wingspan of an albatross, the pressure was intense. His career did not take flight last year after his iconic victory. Less than 24 hours after dispatching Mahut, he lost to Thiemo de Bakker in straight sets. The rest of the summer was a struggle. In his return, he kept his focus on the big picture, even as pundits spent four days talking about his first-round date with Mahut. “The goal is the second week,” Isner said. Last year’s match was played in the cozy confines of Court 18, which now bears a plaque on an outside wall that commemorates the marathon match. The sequel took place on Court 3, one of the All England Club’s show — but by no means showy — courts, with a capacity of 1,980. There were several dozen empty seats when Isner and Mahut walked out for their warm-ups after 6 p.m. After winning the first set, Isner swung with much more freedom on his serve and forehand. In the second and third sets, he produced 26 winners against 7 unforced errors and five of his eight aces. “After the first set, I felt actually really comfortable out there,” said Isner, who finished with 41 winners and 10 unforced errors. “I came out a little tight. Won that first-set tiebreaker. That was huge. That took a lot of pressure off me. Felt like I played pretty well from that point on.” If Isner was uncomfortable last summer being asked to relive his match against Mahut over and over, it was because he knew he had set himself up for a huge encore. “Nothing’s going to live up to that match,” Isner said. Asked what he has to achieve to be known for something other than outlasting Mahut, Isner replied, “In all honesty, I think that’s going to have to be something really big.” He added, “I’d have to make a huge, huge mark in the course of a Grand Slam some time in my career.” In many ways Mahut’s loss last year was a breakthrough. Serving second, Mahut served to stay in the match for 64 consecutive service games, showing a tenacity and focus that has not always been evident in his career. Philippe Bouin, the former lead tennis writer for L’Équipe who collaborated with Mahut on his book, “The Match of My Life,” wrote in an e-mail, “ I had told him that what interested me really was to try to find why a ‘normal French player’ like him, meaning talented, but mentally fragile, had been able for once to behave like a champion.” Mahut could find no such consolation after Tuesday’s match, which was played in adverse conditions. He is one of the few players who does not wear a visor or cap during his matches, and his well-gelled hair made a handy wind gauge as strands waggled in gusts that made serving tricky. Isner was the better returner, earning five break points and converting three. Mahut, who wore black adhesive strips around his left knee, was not moving as well as he normally does. He managed only two break points, one of which he converted. After finishing with 32 winners and 16 unforced errors, Mahut said: “Was difficult to play this match. We talk about last year during three days. That was not easy. But he handled it much better than I did.” It was nearly 8:30 when the last point was played Tuesday. The players met at the net, and Isner said Mahut told him, “I want to see you in the second week of the tournament.” That’s Isner’s mission: to write the perfect ending for both of them.","response":"Wimbledon Rematch: Isner vs. Mahut - A New Chapter in Tennis History"},{"question":"Next question: who played the fish in the cat in the hat?","response":"In the movie \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" released in 2003, the fish character was voiced by Sean Hayes.

He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. A:","response":"Based on the hint provided and the concept of the dilution effect, it is important to understand that animals living in larger groups tend to dilute their risk of attack, leading to increased safety for each individual. In the case of the African Buffalo, the dilution effect would play a significant role in defining the benefits to individuals depending on the size of the group. In case A, when buffaloes live in a large herd often exceeding hundreds, the dilution effect is more pronounced, providing increased safety from predators and other potential threats. This increased safety benefits each individual buffalo, as the risk of being attacked is spread across a larger number of individuals. This is similar to the examples provided in the hint, where larger groups of Camargue horses and water striders experienced decreased attack rates per individual. In case B, when buffaloes live in a small herd, the dilution effect is less pronounced, which means that the benefits from the group living are not as strong as in case A. Under these circumstances, each individual buffalo is relatively more exposed to potential threats as compared to case A, and the risk of attack is not as effectively spread across the smaller number of individuals. Considering the dilution effect and its benefits to individual animals within a group, the African Buffalo would experience greater benefits as a whole in case A when living in a large herd. In this scenario, the risk of attack is more effectively spread across the numerous individuals in the group, providing increased safety for each buffalo. On the contrary, case B, with smaller herds, would provide less benefit to the group as a whole due to a weaker dilution effect. Thus, the African Buffalo group in case A is better off in terms of safety and overall benefits as compared to case B."},{"question":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

The pole should be long enough to accommodate the desired number of mugs and the hooks must be able to securely hold the weight of the mugs. Step 2: Determine the desired height and location Next, I would choose an appropriate location for the pole, considering factors such as accessibility and aesthetics. I would also decide on the height of the pole, ensuring it is installed at a level that is both practical and comfortable for users. Step 3: Install the pole Once the location and height are determined, I would securely install the pole. If mounting on a wall, I would find the studs in the wall, mark the screws' positions, and drill holes for the screws. Next, I would insert the screws through the pole's brackets into the drilled holes and tighten until secure. If using a freestanding pole, I would assemble the pole according to the manufacturer's instructions and ensure it is stable and level on the floor. Step 4: Attach hooks or mug holders Now that the pole is in place, I would attach the hooks or mug holders to the pole. I would space them evenly apart, taking into account the size and shape of the mugs being hung. Each hook should be sturdy enough to hold the weight of the mug without bending or breaking. Step 5: Hang the mugs With the hooks or mug holders in place, I would carefully hang each mug by its handle. I would arrange the mugs in a visually pleasing manner, considering factors such as size, color, and design. If the pole is accessible from all sides, I would hang the mugs to evenly distribute their weight all around the pole. Step 6: Inspect the setup Finally, I would inspect the entire setup to ensure its stability, security, and functionality. I would check that the pole is firmly in place, the hooks are holding the mugs securely, and the entire structure can withstand day-to-day use without any risk of falling or causing injury. Once these steps are completed, the goal of hanging mugs from a pole would be successfully accomplished."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Process: - Warm water floats up from the ocean - A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean - Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area - The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds - The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean - This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger - As it gets bigger the wind rotates faster.

The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper.

There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime.

(AP) — The family of a 10-year-old boy who died on a giant waterslide at a Kanas water park will receive nearly 20 million in settlement payments, according to court documents. The largest payment to Caleb Schwab's family, 14 million, will come from SVV 1 and KC Water Park, two companies associated with the Texas-based water park operator Schlitterbahn, The Kansas City Star (http://bit.ly/2qvFqgb ) reports. The rest of the money will come from the general contractor, the raft manufacturer and a company that consulted on the 17-story \\"Verruckt\\" waterslide that was dubbed the tallest in the world. The waterslide at the park in Kansas City has been closed since Caleb's death on Aug. 7, 2016. The settlements had already been announced, but the amount wasn't disclosed. The Star obtained the court documents after filing motions to intervene. The newspaper argued that the amounts paid by each defendant should be released to ensure those responsible for Caleb's death are held publicly accountable. Caleb's father is Republican Kansas state Rep. Scott Schwab. Attorneys for the family declined to comment to The Star. They said previously in a written statement that the family was \\"determined to hold all those responsible for this tragedy accountable, while doing all they can to ensure this never happens again to another family.\\" Schlitterbahn spokeswoman Winter Prosapio in an email to The Star that Caleb's family and the others affected will \\"forever be in our thoughts and prayers.\\" The company previously announced it would tear down Verruckt once a court allows it, although it remains unclear when that will happen. Verruckt — German for \\"insane\\" — featured multi-person rafts that made a 17-story drop at speeds of up to 70 mph, followed by a surge up a hump and a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. During the ride, Caleb was decapitated, a person familiar with the investigation previously told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly about the boy's death. The two women who took the ride with Caleb suffered serious facial injuries. They have settled their claims against the companies involved in the making of Verruckt. At the time of Caleb's death, Kansas was known for its light regulation of amusement park rides. But last month, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signed off on legislation that beefs up the state's requirements. Rep. Schwab said in March on the floor of the Kansas House that the bill was for \\"the next kid who goes some place in Kansas for a fun weekend.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"The Verruckt water slide at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City gained notoriety in 2016 after the tragic incident involving the death of 10-year-old Caleb Schwab.

Born on January 7, 1800, Fillmore grew up in the Finger Lakes region of New York in a town called Summerhill. His parents, Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard, were farmers and Fillmore was the second of nine children in the family. He was raised in an environment with limited resources and very little formal education. Early in his life, Millard Fillmore worked various jobs to support his family and gained knowledge through reading, displaying traits of self-discipline, determination, and hard work. Eventually, he found his calling in law and became an apprentice in a law office. After several years of hard work and self-education, Fillmore was admitted to the New York bar in 1823. He built a successful legal practice and became active in local politics, eventually joining the anti-Masonic and anti-Jacksonian political movements that were prevalent at that time. His political career began with his election to the New York State Assembly in 1828, and later to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832. Millard Fillmore served three successive terms from 1833 to 1839, and during his time in Congress, he focused on issues ranging from infrastructure to national fiscal policy. Fillmore became a member of the newly-formed Whig party and in 1848, he was nominated as the vice presidential candidate to run alongside the party's presidential candidate, General Zachary Taylor. In the election that year, the Whig party won the presidency, and Fillmore became the 12th Vice President of the United States. However, on July 9, 1850, only sixteen months into his term, President Zachary Taylor passed away, thrusting Fillmore into the role of the 13th President of the United States. One of the most significant events during Fillmore's tenure was the Compromise of 1850, a series of legislative measures aimed at resolving the issues of expanding slavery in the newly acquired territories as a result of the Mexican-American War. Fillmore supported the compromise, which temporarily eased the tensions between the North and South, but its provisions were seen as controversial, and its effects would later contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Millard Fillmore's presidency concluded on March 4, 1853, after he failed to secure his party's nomination for a second term. He retired to his home in Buffalo, New York, where he continued to be involved in various local and national issues. He passed away on March 8, 1874, at the age of 74."},{"question":"Lee was playing with all the kids, she built a snowman for them to have fun.

Fact 2: Basalts are volcanic, micro-crystalline rock. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" with the following options: - glass - basalt - calcite - soils - fire - water - air - sand Answer:","response":"Basalt is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in the process of weathering. To provide a comprehensive explanation, let's examine each option in the context of weathering. 1. Glass: While glass can be physically broken by external forces, it is typically a human-made material and not a natural product of geological processes. Thus, it is not relevant to the process of weathering. 2. Basalt: Basalt is a volcanic, micro-crystalline rock, formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in minerals like plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. Over time, basalt experiences weathering due to the exposure to elements like water, wind, and temperature fluctuations. This causes the rock to break down into smaller pieces, such as pebbles, gravel, or sand. Therefore, basalt is the correct answer. 3. Calcite: Calcite is a carbonate mineral found in many sedimentary rocks like limestone or in metamorphosed marble. While calcite indeed undergoes weathering through processes such as dissolution and carbonation, the given facts do not relate to calcite specifically as they referred to basalt and weathering in general. 4. Soils: Unlike rocks and minerals, soils are a product of the weathering process. Weathering breaks down rocks, transforming them into smaller particles that combine with organic matter to create soil. Therefore, soil is a result of weathering rather than something broken down in the process. 5. Fire: Fire is a product of combustion, a chemical reaction, and not a substance or material that undergoes weathering. It does not fit within the context of the question. 6. Water: Water is one of the primary agents of weathering that contributes to the breakdown of rocks through processes like freeze-thaw, hydration, and dissolution. While water plays a significant role in weathering, it does not break down into smaller pieces itself. 7. Air: Similar to water, air acts as an agent of weathering, primarily through wind erosion or as a facilitator of chemical reactions. However, air is not a material that is broken down during the weathering process. 8. Sand: Sand is a product of weathering and can be created through the breakdown of various rocks, including basalt. Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller particles, such as sand. Sand, therefore, results from weathering rather than undergoing the process itself. In conclusion, given the two facts provided and the available options, basalt is the correct answer to the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" Basalt, a volcanic rock, undergoes weathering through exposure to natural elements, breaking down into smaller particles such as sand or gravel."},{"question":"there are two hydroelectric sites there already but a proposed dam would generate enough electricity to meet the needs of all of africa.

Fact: For too long, many in the Christian church have stood on the wrong side of the gay/lesbian issue. Instead of standing with homosexuals, many in my tradition, and I was one of these once, have mistakenly thought we were upholding the Bible and protecting what we presumed was normal--being straight--from abnormal--being gay. But, more often, we were just hiding our anxiety, as well as our ignorance on the matter, by judging gays and lesbians and disassociating from them. But, no matter what our opinion may be, it was wrong then, and it is wrong today, to be misinformed, to judge or, worse, to disassociate from other people. Anyone with any sense of sanity grieves over the sad consequences of the recently reported bullying of gay teens that resulted in their suicides. I suppose these tragic reports have caused all of us to wake up a bit to the bullying that's been tolerated far too long on school playgrounds, in church sanctuaries and from Christian pulpits. This madness must end. What is clear to me today is this: when prejudice is in the heart, as it is in many toward the LGBT community, you can and will find the scripture to defend your position and to justify your intolerance. For centuries, Christians and churches engaged in this sort of insanity to defend slavery and oppress women. Surprisingly, there are still churches that subjugate women and vigorously defend this prejudice with scripture. They mistakenly think they are just being true to the teachings of Saint Paul regarding the roles of men and women in the world and in the church. But, using any portion of the Bible to justify prejudice of any kind is to demean the scriptures and to damage human beings in the process. It is past time for this abuse of scripture to end, as well as the fear and prejudice that motivates it. How can I claim to be following the compassionate Christ while fostering fear, bigotry, or disgust in my heart? For all I don't know, this much I do know: First, it is inconsistent, not to speak of downright dishonest, to condemn homosexuals on the grounds the Bible says it is \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" Rape, child abuse, promiscuity, and exploitation are a few acts described in the Bible as \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" And these are evils can, and are, committed by people, homosexual and heterosexual alike. What the church should be concerned about is the protection of all people from harm, including dangerous clergypersons, who rape, abuse, and exploit others. Second, gays don't \\"choose\\" to be gay any more than straight people \\"choose\\" to be straight. So, Christians should stop pretending this is a lifestyle choice. Third, sexual orientation is not a political or military issue as in this debacle that is the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" debate. It is instead a civil rights issue. How two-faced can we be to argue against human rights violations in other countries while depriving people of their civil rights in our own? One more thing. The legacy media need to stop reporting on this issue primarily from the perspective of \\"Christians\\" who are opposed to the LGBT community. Not all Christians feel that gay people are sinners for being gay. So, I'm asking the media to give an equal voice to the straight Christian community that stands in solidarity with the gay Christian community. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, \\"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter most.\\" This matters. And, if you're like me, you're ready to take your stand with all people. You're tired of the judging of others and the division it causes. You want, as I do, to practice living like Christ who said, \\"Judge not,\\" (Matt. 7:1) and \\"Do to others as you wish them to do to you,\\" (Matt. 7;12); like the Buddha who said, \\"Have compassion for all beings;\\" and, like Muhammad who said, \\"No man is a true believer unless he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.\\" Steve McSwain is the author of The Enoch Factor: The Sacred Art of Knowing God.

Those who promote it simply don't understand Christian teaching. Jesus did not change the law rather he fulfilled it. What that means is that it is still wrong to do the things proscribed. However, when we fail to do so and confess our sins to Jesus asking for forgiveness, His death on the cross covers our sins (hence the reason why you don't see anyone stoning adulterers any longer). Dietary laws were also not applied to \\"gentile\\" Christians after the Acts 15 council. So, to describe Christians as inconsistent on this issue is to be the \\"cherry-picker\\" not the full counsel of scripture guy. Straight Christians who support homosexuals are consistently those who have, for about a hundred years or so, changed their interpretations of the Bible in the name of \\"modernity\\". These \\"liberal\\" Christians find much in common with Obama's \\"many roads to God\\". The secularists, & the liberal Christians, Jews, Muslims bear in mind jonswitzer is 100% correct. When you appeal any decrypt scripture you are out of luck. All progress is only possible when you do not appeal to scripture. Take slavery, civil rights, human rights were only possible when you made secular appeals. The innate fairness of most people will prevail. Those who do not have that will fall in place after a generation or two. Nothing tangible is achieved, without safeguarding the progress made with utmost vigil for a few generations. The secularists must launch a two pronged strategy. 1) We need to proselytize for the progressive agenda, using secular arguments only. If we have to throw a bone once in a while to the liberal religious crowd we should. But the emphasis is secular arguments of fairness. 2) We need to erode the credibility of scripture all the time, incessantly. The goal is to relegate religion to the dust heap of history. This has been done before several times and successfully too. Each and every time one religion has replaced the another. In the past it has been a religion replacing another and mostly by force. This time it has to be religion & superstition replaced by reason.

It is equally true that they choose how they act upon their orientation. To say one is oriented toward a particular sexual behavior does not mean one should act upon it. How many would say one whose sexual orientation is toward six year olds should feel free to act upon that orientation? Unless you are willing to permit such behavior on the basis that one is oriented toward it, ask yourself how strongly you feel sexual orientation should sanction sexual behavior.

So, to describe Christians as inconsistent on this issue is to be the \\"cherry-picker\\" not the full counsel of scripture guy. Straight Christians who support homosexuals are consistently those who have, for about a hundred years or so, changed their interpretations of the Bible in the name of \\"modernity\\".

But, married heterosexual men and heterosexual men with girlfriends or fiancees back in the USA chose to go on R&R to places where prostitution was legal. When they came back, they didn't wait for you to ask what they did on a 6-day R&R, they BRAGGED ABOUT IT. And not only that, many of them had explicit pornographic proof of themselves \\"doin' it!\\" And they made sure that you saw those pictures because they stuck them in your face. Also, a couple of the \\"straight\\" guys in Company 8, 8th Support Battalion, 196th Light Infantry Brigade in Vietnam had 16mm movie projectors and they only used them to show pornographic movies in their hooches (living quarters).

It has been federally document that close to 98 percent of all people who sexually molest children are exclusively HETEROSEXUAL in their sexual orientation. Pedophilia (real Greek word should be \\"pederastia,\\" sexual activity wit boys) is a mental disorder and is about control and not innate sexual orientation. The original Greek word \\"paraphilia\\" literally means NORMAL human fondness/love for boys.

If the duties can be performed, which is in fact the case regardless of orientation, then why deprive any able-bodied volunteers the privilege of becoming cannon fodder for the American way. The arguments against gays serving openly in the military are exactly the same arguments that were made against blacks and women, yet women and blacks now serve openly and proudly in the ranks and have brought great honor to the institution.

You sat by while gays (black & white) renovated the very neighborhoods where your churches stand and did nothing for the communities (except collect money). Now these same ministers protest the establishment of a gay restaurant or bar in that neighborhood. A neighborhood that has received millions of dollars in equity to the benefit of it's long term residents through increasing property values and lower crime rates. You've neglected your gay sons and forced them on the \\"Down Low\\" where shame and self loathing have driven HIV in African Americans to new highs. You've protested our right to marry, while for years gay communities in urban areas were the primary tax base paying for your children's education. We've fought for your rights for decades now you deny us ours taking your own sons and daughters down in the process.

Furthermore, when you read Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians 5:9-11: \\"9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral peopleâ 10 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. 11 But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister, but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. 12 What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? 13 God will judge those outside. âExpel the wicked person from among you.\\" it is clear that the Church is called to judge it's members.

So, lets stop using the word \\"marriage\\" in all laws and keep the word \\"marriage\\" exclusive to religious organizations who want to convey the blessing of their faith on a civil union. Under the law, there would only be civil unions, straight or gay couples. Our military is much more capable of behaving as adults than we seem to think they are. There have always been gays in the military, sleeping in the same barracks with straights, protecting their buddies backs in a fight, and killing the enemy. DADT is a way to perpetuate a lie - that gays are not in the military. DADT is dishonorable on its face - requiring a person to lie, or at least to deceive. How can we ask those who do us the honor of protecting us to behave dishonorably? Potaboc: I don't care and don't want to know about your sexual behavior - unless it involves a child or coercion of an adult. Why are you interested in the sexual behavior of consenting adults? There are many other Christians who agree with Dr. McSwain - Jesus loves us all. They also believe that the issue of tax breaks and other legal (civil, world of Caesar) benefits of marriage/civil union should be available to committed couples of any various combination of the sexes. The real difference we need to observe is that civil benefits of marriage exist in a civil world of freedom and equity under the law.

Select from: (a). yes. (b). no.","response":"(b). no. Although the given statement provides some information about computers controlling various utilities, it does not specifically answer the question about demonstrated equipment controlled by computers that are not connected to the internet and their vulnerabilities. A more detailed and relevant answer would be: Computers that control various equipment and systems in critical infrastructure, such as power plants, water treatment facilities, and transportation networks, can also be vulnerable despite not being connected to the internet. Some of these vulnerabilities stem from physical security breaches, malicious insiders, or attacks via secondary connections, such as USB drives or other removable media. One such example is the Stuxnet malware, a sophisticated computer worm that was discovered in 2010. It was specifically designed to target industrial control systems (ICS) in nuclear plants, most notably the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz. Stuxnet managed to compromise the air-gapped (isolated from the internet) systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and then reprogramming the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that manage the plant's centrifuges, effectively disrupting their operation. Another example of demonstrated vulnerability is the BlackEnergy malware, which was responsible for the 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine's power grid. It caused significant blackouts, affecting more than 200,000 residents. The malware was delivered through a phishing email, thus bypassing the air-gapped control systems, and was designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the ICS. Moreover, in October 2020, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert about the Ripple20 vulnerabilities, which are a set of 19 vulnerabilities found in the software library developed by Treck Inc., widely used in embedded devices. These vulnerabilities, some deemed critical, can potentially allow an attacker to compromise the device, steal sensitive data, or launch a denial-of-service attack. More than millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, industrial control equipment, and medical devices are at risk due to these vulnerabilities. In conclusion, despite not being connected to the internet, computers controlling equipment in utilities and other critical infrastructure can still be vulnerable to security threats. The vulnerabilities may arise from a variety of sources, including physical security breaches, insider threats, and attacks through removable media or secondary connections. As a result, it is crucial to implement robust security measures, both in terms of network security and employee education, to mitigate such risks and protect the critical infrastructure."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Possible A: laugh, sit, being entertained, math, meet Why is \\"meet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","response":"\\"Meet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it signifies the initial point of contact between two friends before they engage in any activity together, such as playing. Oftentimes, friends need to meet at a specific location or time before they can start their planned activities. This is especially true for kids, who, unlike adults, typically have limited modes of private transportation and may not have constant access to communication devices like mobile phones. Therefore, meeting is a crucial step in arranging and coordinating shared experiences. In contrast, the other possible answers do not generally align with the logical prelude to playing. Here's a brief analysis of each: 1. \\"Laugh\\": Laughing is a spontaneous expression of amusement and joy, which might occur during or after playing, rather than before; it is not a precursor to play but rather a byproduct of enjoyment. 2. \\"Sit\\": Sitting is usually associated with stationary or passive activities such as resting, eating, or engaging in conversation. Although it is plausible that a child might sit for a moment before playing, it is not an immediate prerequisite for play. 3. \\"Being entertained\\": This phrase suggests that the child is passively receiving entertainment, rather than actively participating in an activity like playing with a friend. Moreover, the notion of being entertained before playing does not directly convey an action or interaction with a friend that would lead to playtime. 4. \\"Math\\": While math can be a fun and engaging educational activity, it is not typically considered as a precursor to playing with a friend. In this context, math would seemingly be an unrelated activity that might be done independently or in a school setting. In summary, \\"meet\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly represents the necessary initial interaction between two friends before they can embark on any shared activities, like playing. The other options, though potentially related to a child's experiences, do not logically precede a play session or directly involve interactions with a friend in the same way that meeting does."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. Context: As a presbyter of the church at Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (199 - 217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that Origen of Alexandria, then a young man, heard him preach. He accused Pope Zephyrinus of modalism, the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably Justin Martyr, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when Pope Callixtus I (217 - 222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery. Hippolytus himself advocated an excessive rigorism. At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack Pope Urban I (222 - 230 AD) and Pope Pontian ( 230 - 235 AD). G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome. Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher. Under the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 AD to Sardinia, likely dying in the mines. It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under Pope Fabian (236-250), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called chronography of the year 354 (more precisely, the Catalogus Liberianus, or Liberian Catalogue) reports that on August 13, probably in 236 AD, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the Via Tiburtina, his funeral being conducted by Justin the Confessor. This document indicates that, by about 255 AD, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church. Question: Was he a good leader? Answer:","response":"Evaluating whether Hippolytus of Rome was a good leader necessitates considering various aspects of his personal and theological contributions as well as the context in which he lived. 1. Theological Knowledge and Eloquence: Hippolytus was reputed for his learning and eloquence, as noted during his time as a presbyter of the Church at Rome. His dedication to the promotion and articulation of the Christian faith demonstrates his commitment to sharing his knowledge and providing strong theological arguments. 2. Defense against Heresies: Hippolytus actively fought against theological heresies, such as modalism. In doing so, he upheld the integrity of Christian doctrines. Championing the Logos doctrine, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"), further demonstrates his commitment to protecting and preserving the purity of Christian beliefs. 3. Ethical Conservatism and Rigorism: Hippolytus was an ethical conservative, upholding traditional Christian values, especially in matters of morality. However, his rigorism often led to him advocating excessively strict policies, which may have alienated some believers who sought forgiveness and reconciliation within the Church. 4. Schismatic Behavior and Rivalry: While Hippolytus showcased strong leadership qualities, his actions in allowing himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome and his persistent attacks on Popes Urban I and Pope Pontian indicate an inclination toward divisiveness rather than unity within the Christian Church. 5. Possible Reconciliation: It is believed that Hippolytus might have reconciled with the Church in Rome before his death. His burial in Rome and eventual recognition as a martyr and priest suggest that the schism might have been resolved and that Hippolytus may have been incorporated back into the Church community. In conclusion, whether Hippolytus was a good leader is a matter of interpretation. On the one hand, he displayed theological wisdom, eloquence, and the ability to provide compelling arguments against heresies. On the other hand, his rigorism and involvement in schismatic behaviors indicate a more divisive and unyielding approach to leadership. It is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of his leadership style and the environment in which he lived to form a well-rounded opinion on his effectiveness as a leader."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

The fundamental unit of solar time is the day. Two types of solar time are apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). A tall pole vertically fixed in the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local apparent noon, or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly. The problem is that in September the Sun takes less time (as measured by an accurate clock) to make an apparent revolution than it does in December; 24 \\"hours\\" of solar time can be 21 seconds less or 29 seconds more than 24 hours of clock time. As explained in the equation of time article, this is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e. the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, meaning that the Earth-Sun distance varies throughout the year), and the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit (the so-called obliquity of the ecliptic).

And I was wondering How would Kai feel as a result? Answer:","response":"In order to answer this question, I will first assume that Kai enjoys bedtime stories. Now, let me analyze step-by-step the possible feelings Kai might experience as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night. Step 1: Setting the context The bedtime story routine creates a calming and soothing environment for Kai. Creating a specific time and place for a story can signal to their brain that it's time to wind down and get ready for sleep. Step 2: Emotional connection During the bedtime story, Kai might feel a stronger emotional connection with the person reading the story to them, such as a parent or guardian. This shared time can build trust and a sense of safety in the relationship. Step 3: Impact on imagination and creativity Bedtime stories can stimulate Kai's imagination and creativity, as they listen to various stories featuring different characters, settings, and scenarios. This can make them feel excited and intrigued by the endless possibilities within the stories. Step 4: Developing empathy and understanding As Kai listens to different stories with characters facing various challenges or displaying particular emotions, they might develop empathy and understanding for others' feelings and situations. This can make them feel more connected to the world and the people around them. Step 5: Sense of comfort and relaxation Finally, the act of listening to a bedtime story can provide a sense of comfort and relaxation, as they unwind from the day and let their mind be transported into the story they are hearing. This can result in a feeling of contentment and peace. Based on these steps, it is reasonable to conclude that Kai would feel comforted, connected, and relaxed as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night before going to sleep."},{"question":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is accused of being a devil?, using the article: Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue., what would be the answer ?

King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies.

You get your genes from your parents. You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells. An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes. In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian José Mourinho admitted an \\"impossible\\" save by Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper on loan at Atlético Madrid, had been critical as his team were well beaten in the Champions League semi-final. The Spanish club progress to confront their city rivals, Real, in the showpiece in Lisbon. This game, and with it the tie, was level on aggregate when Courtois dived to his left to turn aside a 53rd-minute header from John Terry at full stretch. The young Belgian's involvement in the tie had been the subject of some controversy, with the terms of his loan to Atlético demanding payments of around £2.5m for each appearance made against his parent club. Atlético had claimed they could not afford to pay those fees, prompting Uefa to insist any deal that affected the competition's integrity should be deemed \\"unenforceable\\". Courtois played both legs of the tie and, having denied Terry, saw Samuel Eto'o foul Diego Costa to concede a penalty and hand Atlético an initiative they did not relinquish. \\"The difference was one moment in the second half, where the Atlético goalkeeper makes an impossible save from John Terry's header, an amazing save, and instead of 2-1 to Chelsea a few minutes later [we concede] a penalty,\\" said Mourinho. \\"After that, there was only one team on the pitch. My team played with pride, honour and professionalism, but we had immediately the feeling the game was lost. \\"From that moment the game was controlled by Atlético in a very mature way. They had complete control. They had the feeling the game was in their hands, and after that they were very solid, very mature, a real team. I knew that before, and I congratulate them now.\\" Asked specifically about the irony of Courtois being a Chelsea player, with the youngster's future next season still unresolved and Atlético keen to retain him for a further 12 months, the manager added: \\"No, he's the Atlético goalkeeper, and he did his job.\\" Mourinho's heaviest home defeat as Chelsea manager was confirmed by Arda Turan's late third to inflict his fourth successive exit in the semi-finals of this competition since he won it with Internazionale in 2010, and his third with Chelsea. Chelsea hope to become more adventurous against the elite next term with reinforcements added in the summer. \\"Next season will be better than this season – that's our objective,\\" said Mourinho, who had selected César Azpilicueta in midfield with Oscar injured and both Frank Lampard and Mikel John Obi banned. \\"Our young players will be better, hopefully we will have a couple of players to improve our team and we will try to do better next season. \\"We are realistic but, at the same time, there have been times this season when we have been optimistic. There is a moment where you can dream and you think things are possible. Because we did well in the Champions League and in the Premier League, there was a moment where we felt we could do it. In the Premier League it was the match against Aston Villa that made me believe that we had no chance to be champions. After that we built again the momentum and we were waiting for the Liverpool match to be the title match, but we had another surprise against Sunderland. Even so, the boys did a very good Premier League. \\"In the Champions League, it's the same. We knew there were teams with more potential than us, who were more ready than us to win the competition, but because you go step by step and beat Paris Saint-Germain after a 3-1 defeat in the first leg, you build your dream. And today, I think it was proved that we had our chance. Until minute 59 we were completely in the game. But the save and the penalty were crucial and, from that moment, the game was over. The players gave everything, but they can go home with a clear conscience. They did their work well but lost to a very good team. That's football.\\" Mourinho conceded that Atlético and Real were \\"probably the best two teams in the competition\\", with Diego Simeone's side the only unbeaten team in this year's Champions League to date and now in their first final for 40 years. \\"This will be a new experience for us because it's been so many years since our club was last in a final like this,\\" said Simeone. \\"Real are a very powerful side used to these big European nights, but we know them. This is a very special moment for us.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"The most significant parts of the text concern Chelsea's defeat by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, resulting in Atletico Madrid advancing to face Real Madrid in the final. José Mourinho, Chelsea's manager at the time, concedes that key moments in the game were the \\"impossible\\" save by Chelsea's then-loanee goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who played for Atlético, and a penalty that shifted the advantage to Atlético. Mourinho points out that after these events, Atlético controlled the game and his team could not make a comeback. Another crucial segment of the text is the controversy revolving around Courtois' position due to his loan terms from Chelsea to Atletico, which demanded high payments for each match he played against Chelsea. Atlético argued they could not afford the payments, resulting in Uefa stepping in to state that such deal affecting the competition's integrity was \\"unenforceable.\\" Therefore, Courtois played in both legs of the tie. Reflecting on Chelsea's performance, Mourinho names the defeat as his heaviest home loss as Chelsea manager but praises his team for playing with \\"pride, honour, and professionalism.\\" He also talks about the team's outlook, expressing optimism about their chances in the next season with the improvement of young players and potential new recruits. Lastly, the text highlights Atlético advancing to their first Champions League final in 40 years, the only unbeaten team in the competition at that point. Atlético's manager, Diego Simeone, views the upcoming match against Real Madrid as a \\"very special moment\\" for the team."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You already know that you have feelings for this person. If you have not fully admitted to yourself just how strong those feelings are, though, you will need to do that before you can start getting over them. Ignoring the strength of the enemy—in this case, your own feelings of affection will only make it more difficult to triumph in the end. Even though you never actually dated, you invested a lot of time, energy, and emotion into this person. The depth of your feelings probably reflect this. Resist the urge to brush this off as nothing more than a “silly little crush.” Admitting to the full depth of your feelings may knock your pride down a peg or two, but ultimately, this action will be more helpful than letting yourself stay in denial. There are two main truths you need to admit to. First, the person in question does not share your feelings. Second, your situation is no different from that of others who have suffered the same fate. Your feelings are one-sided. Even if you know this deep down, honestly admitting this to yourself can be one of the toughest parts of the whole process. You might want to think that something can happen between the two of you, but the fact of the matter is that your feelings are not mutual. Others have gone through the same thing you are going through now. The good news is that this means you are not alone and that you can survive this just as well as all the others who have gone before you have. The bad news is that, odds are, your situation is no exception to the rule. You might think that you can make the other person fall for you, but in spite of what romance novels and movies suggest, this rarely happens in real life. Your situation is far more likely to follow the path of reality than of fiction. Being head-over-heels for someone can be a nice feeling, but after a certain point, that feeling brings you more pain than pleasure. Letting go of the feeling will make you a happier person in the long run. Ask yourself if you are really, honestly happy with the way things are now. Chances are, if you are online and reading articles about how to get over someone you never dated, the answer is “no.” If you are not happy, then the best thing to do is move on so that you can be happy again. The person you adore might say or do something genuinely misleading on occasion, but more often than not, the supposedly misleading things that person does are only misleading because you are desperate for hope. If an action does not express affection on the surface, do not tell yourself that it does so beneath the surface. The vast majority of guys will be obvious about it if they like you back. While girls are a bit more notorious for giving off mixed signals, if you are obvious enough about your own feelings and she does not respond in kind, she is probably not interested in you in that way. The two of you likely have some history of interaction, and you may have let yourself believe that the interaction between you indicated a possible spark. Think back and be honest with yourself about whether or not that spark ever existed. Treat your memories with the same objective eye you have begun to use when viewing your present interactions. Summary:","response":"To get over someone you never dated, admit your strong feelings and accept that they are one-sided, understand others have gone through the same thing, and focus on becoming happier by letting go of the situation."},{"question":"Continue the following story. Kevin was a better baker than Hunter so Possible answers: a). Kevin could create a beauliful flan from the oven.. b). Hunter could create a beauliful flan from the oven..","response":"a). Kevin could create a beautiful flan from the oven. The aroma of the flan filled the kitchen as Kevin carefully removed the dish from the oven. He had practiced his baking skills time and time again, hoping to outshine his rival, Hunter. Step by step, he honed his techniques and perfected his recipes, which led him to become the better baker between the two. Kevin's careful approach to baking began with selecting the best ingredients. He would visit the local market, handpicking the freshest fruits and dairy products. This allowed him to ensure the optimal taste and quality of his creations. Next, he would meticulously measure and sift the dry ingredients. He believed that the key to a perfect flan was in the delicate balance of its components. As he mixed the ingredients, he paid close attention to their consistency, making sure not to overmix the batter. After pouring the mixture into the mold, Kevin would gently tap the dish on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles. This step was crucial in achieving a smooth and delicate texture in the final product. As the flan baked, Kevin monitored the temperature and adjusted the oven as needed. He knew that just a few degrees could make the difference between a perfect flan and a burnt disaster. He used his experience and intuition to determine the precise moment when the flan was ready to be taken out of the oven. As Kevin unveiled the flan, it became evident that his efforts had paid off. His dessert had a flawless, golden brown surface, and the sides were perfectly set. The sweet scent wafted through the kitchen, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. In contrast, Hunter's flan lacked that same finesse and attention to detail. Though he too was a skilled baker, he often took shortcuts or neglected critical steps in pursuit of efficiency. As a result, his creations, while still delicious, couldn't compare to the delicate beauty and perfection that Kevin was able to achieve. Ultimately, it was Kevin's dedication to mastering his craft that earned him the title of a better baker. His success served as proof that patience, practice, and precision were truly the keys to creating a beautiful flan worthy of admiration and praise."},{"question":"public glasses outdoor blowjob Add punctuation.","response":"I'm really sorry, but I'm unable to make those changes for you.

Eliminate irrelevant options: Nylon leggings are a type of clothing, so we can eliminate options that don't have a direct relationship with clothing storage - rope and car. 3. Consider the nature of nylon leggings: Nylon leggings are a clothing item typically worn on the legs and are commonly stored along with other clothing items. 4. Compare the remaining options - stockings, clothing, and drawer: Stockings are a related but separate clothing item, and thus not a suitable storage place for nylon leggings. Between clothing and drawer, storing nylon leggings with other clothing might be too general, as it does not denote a specific designation for storage. 5. Final verdict: Based on the above analysis, a drawer (specifically, a clothing drawer) would be the most suitable place for someone to keep their nylon leggings."},{"question":"(1) There is a dramatic showdown , where Tom rides a horse and organizes in to vindicate Jack . (2) There is a dramatic showdown where Tom rides a horse and organizes to defend Jack . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the Valentine's Day of 1997, in a small town, a cave-in on the north side of a Hanninger mine trapped six miners. Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially reluctant to go, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before going inside. Sarah goes alone and gets lost looking for Axel and Irene. She runs across a teen and a few seconds later, he is stabbed through his eye. She is confronted by Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a bloody pickaxe, and she flees, finding several dead bodies. Axel grabs her and they, along with Irene, hide from the killer. Warden eventually sees the trio, and they run out of the mine, meeting Tom as he comes in. Warden hits Tom with the pickaxe, injuring him, while the other three run...

Hypothesis: The Dayton Peace Treaty was formulated to end the war in Bosnia.","response":"Although the provided paragraph does not explicitly mention the Dayton Peace Treaty, the situation stated does refer to a significant diplomatic and military endeavor undertaken in Bosnia that resulted in peace. This aligns with the overall circumstances that led to the formulation of the Dayton Peace Treaty. The Dayton Agreement, signed in 1995, was, indeed, a successful effort to end the Bosnian War. However, the paragraph provided only indirectly infers this. It makes a broader point about the combination of diplomacy and military force used by the international community, including the U.S., to bring peace to a very fragile region, which aligns with the intent and goals of the Dayton Peace Treaty. In more detail, Bosnia was a conflict zone during the early- to mid-1990s due to the Bosnian War, which was an extremely violent, complex, and destructive conflict fueled by ethnic tensions among Bosniacs, Serbs, and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The U.S., as well as other international actors, were heavily invested in restoring relative peace and stability in the region, primarily to prevent further humanitarian catastrophes and inhibit potential ripple effects of the conflict to other regions. Therefore, while the paragraph does not directly confirm the specified hypothesis about the Dayton Peace Treaty being formulated to end the war in Bosnia, it does exhibit circumstances consistent with the formulation and objectives of the Dayton Peace Treaty. Consequently, the hypothesis could be regarded as potentially true based on the provided paragraph. However, without more specific mention of the Dayton Peace Treaty in the text, a definitive verdict on the hypothesis's truthfulness based solely on this paragraph remains open-ended."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables.

Natalie found it easier to write children's books than Emily because","response":"Natalie found it easier to write children's books than Emily because she had a natural ability to connect with and understand the world from a child's perspective. This unique skill allowed her to craft stories that resonated deeply with young readers, capturing their imaginations and creating memorable characters and narratives that were both educational and entertaining. One of the main reasons Natalie excelled in writing children's books was her extensive experience working directly with children. Over the years, she had volunteered at schools and libraries, organized reading programs, and even taught creative writing workshops for kids. These experiences provided her with invaluable insight into the minds of young readers, enabling her to tune in to their interests, preferences, and attention spans when crafting her stories. Natalie's background in education and child psychology also played a significant role in her prowess as a children's author. Her understanding of children's cognitive and emotional development allowed her to create age-appropriate content that not only entertained but also Foster emotional growth and intellectual curiosity. She carefully crafted her stories to include themes like empathy, friendship, and responsibility, making them more than just enjoyable reads but also valuable tools for character development and moral education. Moreover, Natalie had a unique storytelling style that particularly resonated with young readers. Her ability to weave intricate tales in simple, easy-to-understand language allowed her to create immersive worlds that were both exciting and approachable for children. This, combined with her gift for humor and wit, made her stories delightful and engaging even for reluctant readers. Emily, on the other hand, struggled with writing children's books because her strength was in crafting more complex, thought-provoking literature for an adult audience. While she had an incredible talent for developing intricate plots and multi-faceted characters, her writing style and thematic choices were not always suitable for younger readers. She often found it challenging to strike the right balance between simplicity and sophistication, which consequently made her stories less accessible and less appealing to young readers. Furthermore, Emily had limited experience working with children, and therefore lacked the deeper understanding of their thought processes and reading preferences that Natalie possessed. Although she had a genuine love for storytelling and a passion for connecting with readers, it was difficult for her to adjust her approach to cater to a younger demographic. In conclusion, Natalie found it easier to write children's books than Emily because of her unique ability to connect with young readers, her extensive experience with children, her background in education and child psychology, and her natural flair for storytelling that captivated young audiences. In contrast, Emily's strengths and experiences were better suited for writing literature geared towards an adult audience, making it more challenging for her to create content that resonated with children."},{"question":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

And according to a survey by social networking site badoo. com, they all best illustrate the word \\"cool\\". But just what does it mean to say someone is \\"cool\\"? Most would answer that it is something to do with being independent-minded and not following the crowd. Yale University art professor Robert Farris Thompson says that the term \\"cool\\" goes back to 15th century West African philosophy . \\"Cool\\" relates to ideas of grace under pressure. \\"In Africa, \\" he writes, \\"coolness is a positive quality which combines calmness, silence, and life. \\" The modern idea of \\"cool\\" developed largely in the US in the period after World War II. \\"Post-war 'cool' was in part an expression of war-weariness . . . it went against the strict social rules of the time, \\" write sociologists Dick Pountain and David Robins in Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude. But it was the American actor James Dean who became the symbol for \\"cool\\" in the hugely successful 1955 movie Rebel without a Cause. Dean plays a tough guy who disobeys his parents and the authorities . He always gets the girl, smokes cigarettes, wears a leather jacket and beats up bullies . In the movie, Dean showed what \\"cool\\" would mean to American young people for the next 60 years. Today the focus of \\"cool\\" has changed to athletics stars. Often in movies about schools, students gain popularity on the athletics field more than in the classroom. This can be seen quite clearly in movies like Varsity Blues and John Tucker Must Die.

Chess and other thinking games have been becoming more popular in schools. \\"Call it the Harry Potterization of America --a time when being smart is the new cool, \\" writes journalist Joe Sunnen.

But a federal appeals court has now overturned that decision. The lawsuit was filed by a woman who claims she was drugged and raped by men who had contacted her through the website. The woman, referred to in court documents as Jane Doe, was an aspiring model who had created a profile on Model Mayhem. She claims she was contacted and invited to a casting session in 2011, but it was a sham and she was drugged and then raped on camera by two men. Two men were jailed for such a scam in 2012. The woman claims Internet Brands was aware that people were using the Model Mayhem site to target women in this way, but failed to warn its members, making it liable for negligence under California law. Internet Brands filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the grounds that it was barred by the US Communications Decency Act (CDA), which says websites cannot be held responsible for content posted by their users. \\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,\\" the law states. At the time, online giants including eBay and Facebook told the court that the lawsuit would have a \\"chilling effect\\" on the internet. The district court dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. However, a federal appeals court in California has now revived the lawsuit because it does not concern what was posted on Model Mayhem. \\"Jane Doe does not claim to have been lured by any posting that Internet Brands failed to remove.

Evolution, on the other hand, is the change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. This process is driven by genetic variation, natural selection, and genetic drift, all of which take place across multiple generations as organisms are born and die. So, in this context, it would be more accurate to associate birth and death with the process of evolution rather than illness."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Q: Acetyl-coa is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and what else? Choices: - hormones - acids - hydrocarbons - proteins A: Answer:","response":"Acetyl-CoA, a vital molecule in metabolism, is formed from the breakdown of three primary biomolecules, namely carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Each of these biomolecules undergoes a series of complex metabolic processes to generate Acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle) to produce ATP, the primary cellular energy currency. Here, we will delve into a bit more detail about how carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins contribute to the production of Acetyl-CoA. 1. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates, primarily in the form of glucose, are the primary fuel source for generating Acetyl-CoA. Glucose undergoes glycolysis, which is a set of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to Acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the mitochondria. This commits the glucose-derived carbon to the citric acid cycle, where it can be completely oxidized to produce ATP. 2. Lipids: Lipids, specifically fatty acids, are another essential source of Acetyl-CoA. The breakdown of fatty acids, a process called beta-oxidation, occurs in the mitochondria. In this process, fatty acids are broken down into two-carbon units, which are then converted into Acetyl-CoA molecules. These Acetyl-CoA molecules can then enter the citric acid cycle and contribute to ATP production. Beta-oxidation is particularly crucial when glucose levels are low since it allows the body to tap into its stored energy reserves in the form of triacylglycerols. 3. Proteins: Proteins are primarily responsible for the structure, function, and regulation of cells, but they can also serve as an energy source under certain conditions. When proteins are broken down, their constitutive amino acids are released and subjected to deamination, a process that removes the amino group of the amino acid. The carbon skeletons that remain can then be converted into various metabolites, which can enter either glycolysis or the citric acid cycle. Subsequently, some of these metabolites can generate Acetyl-CoA, which can then participate in the citric acid cycle to produce ATP. In conclusion, Acetyl-CoA is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins through various metabolic pathways. These three essential biomolecules contribute to the production of Acetyl-CoA, which serves as a critical entry point to the citric acid cycle and ATP generation, ensuring that cells have the necessary energy to function and maintain their structural integrity. Thus, the correct answer to the question is proteins."},{"question":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Earthquakes also occur at divergent plate boundaries.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

It tells the story of Eric \`\` The Kid '' Stoner , a young Depression - era poker player , as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best . This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \`\` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his \`\` ugly duckling '' film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances . - A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person. - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. - Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \\"the stakes\\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you?

There is every book by Chomsky in this library.","response":"The sentence \\"There is every book by Chomsky in this library\\" is linguistically understandable, but it is not the most standard or preferred way to express the idea that the library contains all books written by Chomsky. Although the sentence does convey the intended message, its structure is somewhat awkward and can be improved for greater clarity, fluency, and adherence to conventional English grammar and syntax norms. To analyze why the sentence is not optimally constructed, let's break down its structure: - \\"There is\\": This phrase typically functions as an existential statement, asserting the existence or presence of something within a context. - \\"every book by Chomsky\\": This phrase acts as the subject, though it would be more straightforward to place the subject at the beginning of the sentence. The use of \\"every\\" implies that the library indeed possesses each book Chomsky has authored. - \\"in this library\\": This prepositional phrase describes the location where the books are present, i.e., the library in question. Taking these aspects into account, a revised version of the sentence that adheres more to standard English grammatical structure would be: \\"All of Chomsky's books are in this library.\\" By rephrasing the sentence in this manner, we achieve the following improvements: 1. The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence (\\"All of Chomsky's books\\"), which adheres to the canonical English subject-verb-object sentence structure and provides a clearer focal point. 2. The verb \\"are\\" replaces \\"there is,\\" leading to a clearer assertion about the presence of the subject (i.e., Chomsky's books) in the library, and making it more concise. 3. The location of the books is still clearly communicated through the prepositional phrase \\"in this library.\\" The revised sentence maintains the essential meaning without compromising precision or clarity. In summary, while the original sentence \\"There is every book by Chomsky in this library\\" is linguistically acceptable in the sense that it conveys the intended idea, it can be restructured and improved for clarity and grammatical correctness by revising it to \\"All of Chomsky's books are in this library.\\""},{"question":"Options: a).

Question: suppose owls see more prey happens, how will it affect MORE recyling. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","response":"The question associates an increase in prey observed by owls with the effect on recycling. While the two concepts might appear unrelated, there could be an indirect connection based on the potential impact of increased recycling on the environment. Therefore, the answer would involve understanding the potential link between these two processes. In the recycling process described, items that can be reused are collected, sorted, broken down into smaller parts, and then converted into raw materials that can be sold to manufacturers to create new products. This process contributes to reducing waste, conserving natural resources, and lowering energy consumption. Consequently, recycling can have a positive impact on the environment, promoting a healthier ecosystem for various species, including owls and their prey. An increase in recycling might lead to improvements in natural habitats, enhanced food sources for prey species, and reduced pollution. As a result of these positive changes in the environment, the prey population may prosper, enabling owls to observe more prey. Therefore, if the question implies how an increase in prey observed by owls would be affected by more recycling, the answer would be: A: more This is because increased recycling has the potential to improve environmental conditions for prey species, which could then lead to owls seeing more prey in their habitats. However, it is important to note that this relationship is not direct, and various other factors can influence prey populations and owls' ability to observe them."},{"question":"Answer the following question. Since 2004, 'The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands' has fought for independence from which country?","response":"The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands, an unrecognized and symbolic micronation, declared its struggle for independence from Australia since 2004. The Coral Sea Islands are a group of uninhabited islets located east of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, and they encompass an extensive area within the Coral Sea. The establishment of this unique micronation was a direct response to the Australian government's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage as legal and legitimate. At the time, the Marriage Amendment Act 2004 had just been passed, subsequently defining marriage exclusively as the union of a man and a woman in Australia. In response, a group of LGBTQ+ activists sailed to the Coral Sea Islands, raised the flag of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom on Cato Island, which would then serve as the capital of the new nation, and declared independence from Australia on June 14, 2004. Led by their emperor, Dale Anderson, the micronation adopted a national flag based on the pride flag commonly used by the LGBTQ+ community, the rainbow flag. The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom also chose the iconic gay anthem, \\"I Am What I Am,\\" by the late Gloria Gaynor, as their national anthem. Additionally, they adopted the slogan \\"The kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands is not a micronation for the gay and lesbian elite, but a nation for all who are gay or support gay rights.\\" While the micronation declared itself as a constitutional monarchy, it lacked any real authority, political structure, or physical territory beyond the uninhabited Coral Sea Islands. Its claim for independence from Australia has never been officially recognized by any government, and it remains largely a symbolic and political statement to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly marriage equality. In December 2017, Australia finally legalized same-sex marriage through a postal survey that recorded nearly 62% of respondents voting in favor of marriage equality. As a result, the significance and symbolic resonance of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands have shifted, and its relevance in the modern pursuit for LGBTQ+ rights continues to evolve."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Mounted officers in bright green jackets sit on their horses wearing helmets.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Police are riding animals.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others (in this case, PersonY) might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Q: Head: PersonX accepts happily<sep>Tail: grateful A:","response":"Task explanation: You have a tuple with two phrases separated by \\"<sep>\\". The first part (Head) describes an event involving generic person names, and the second part (Tail) mentions a feeling. Your objective is to classify whether PersonY or other participants in the event experience the feeling in the Tail as a result of the situation in the Head. The answer should be either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Guidelines for solving: 1. Identify the event in the Head and the feeling in the Tail. 2. Determine if the event causes PersonY or others to experience the mentioned feeling. Applying these guidelines, we can solve the given task as follows: Q: Head: PersonX accepts happily<sep>Tail: grateful 1. The event is \\"PersonX accepts happily,\\" and the feeling is \\"grateful.\\" 2. As PersonX is the one happily accepting something, it's likely PersonX feels grateful. However, the task inquires about PersonY or others, not PersonX. Therefore, we can't confirm that PersonY or other participants feel grateful as a result of PersonX accepting happily.

Here’s an example in French: \\"La vie est un voyage, pas une destination.\\" This translates to \\"Life is a journey, not a destination.\\" In this sentence, we can see a philosophical perspective on life expressed in French. This quote encapsulates the idea that the most important aspect of life is not necessarily where we end up (the destination), but the experiences, growth, and learning that transpire while we are getting there (the journey). Just like other languages, French is divided into semantic units: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections that construct meaningful sentences. In the sentence given, \\"La\\" is a definite article indicating a specific noun, \\"vie\\" is the noun meaning life, \\"est\\" is the verb 'to be' in third person singular, \\"un\\" is an indefinite article indicating a non-specific noun, \\"voyage\\" is the noun meaning journey, \\"pas\\" is a negation adverb, and \\"une destination\\" is a noun phrase where \\"une\\" is an indefinite article and \\"destination\\" means destination. The sentence embodies the rich diversity and complex structure of the French language. French, as a Romance language, has a significant influence on many languages in terms of vocabulary, syntax, and pronunciation, and it is spoken by almost 300 million people around the world, in all five continents. Not only is it an official language in more than 25 countries, but it also holds special status in numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, European Union, and the Red Cross, to name a few. In conclusion, the sentence is just a small sample of the French language's richness and depth, showcasing the poetic and philosophical side of this world language."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The relieved British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941, and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the RAF conclude?\\" Select from: A). yes. B). no.","response":"B). no. The sentence \\"The relieved British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941, and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the RAF conclude?\\" The sentence merely explains that the British started evaluating the consequences of the Blitz and that the RAF Air Staff utilized the German experience to enhance their bombing offensives. However, it does not specifically detail the conclusions drawn by the Royal Air Force (RAF) after their assessment. In order to provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the RAF conclude?\\", the response must include specific findings or insights that the RAF reached. For instance, the valid answer could refer to conclusions regarding the effectiveness of certain bombing strategies, the need to update or upgrade aircraft or technology, or the insights gained about enemy tactics and defensive measures. It would be helpful to mention any adjustments or plans that were implemented following the assessment, which demonstrated the RAF's learnings and conclusions from the Blitz. An example of a valid response could be something like this: \\"The RAF concluded that night-time bombing raids were more effective in avoiding enemy defenses, so they increased the frequency of nocturnal sorties. They also realized the importance of developing better navigational aids and more accurate bombing technology to improve the precision and efficacy of their air offensives.\\" This response not only includes specific findings and conclusions but also highlights the actions taken by the RAF in response to their assessment.

It's not clear when investigators might talk to Sailor, who despite being bloodied and suffering a broken wrist, pulled herself from the wreckage and walked to the nearest home. She was dressed for Florida, where her family had been visiting, and was wearing shorts, a short-sleeve shirt and only one sock when she found a home about a mile from the crash site. Authorities said she walked through thick woods and briar patches in near-freezing temperatures. \\"She absolutely went to the nearest house that she could have,\\" Kentucky State Police Lt. Brent White said. \\"But it was still a considerable feat for her to do that.\\" The remains of the Piper PA-34 plane were moved Sunday so officials with the NTSB can inspect it.

The agency will issue a preliminary report in about 10 days, Moats said at a news conference in Eddyville. Sailor was treated at a hospital and released to a relative Saturday. After the Friday night crash, Sailor trekked to the home of 71-year-old Larry Wilkins, who answered her knock at the door and called police. Wilkins said the girl was crying and covered in blood. \\"She told me that her mom and dad were dead, and she had been in a plane crash, and the plane was upside down,\\" Wilkins said. Sailor was alert and able to point emergency workers looking for the plane in the right direction, said Lyon County Judge executive Wade White, who arrived at the crash site. The crash killed Sailor's parents, Marty Gutzler, 48; and his wife, Kimberly Gutzler, 46; Sailor's sister, Piper Gutzler, 9; and a cousin, Sierra Wilder, 14. All were from Nashville, Illinois. White said the father's body was \\"the last one they pulled out because of how deep he was buried.\\" Marty Gutzler was flying the plane, which reported engine trouble and lost contact with air traffic controllers around 5:55 p.m. CST, authorities said. Controllers tried to direct the pilot to an airport 5 to 7 miles from the crash scene. About 40 minutes later, 911 dispatchers received the call from Wilkins. The Gutzlers had been visiting family in Key West, Florida, and stopped in Tallahassee, Florida, on the way back to Mount Vernon, Illinois. Gutzler was a licensed commercial pilot and flight instructor, according to the FAA website. A woman who answered the telephone at Campagna Funeral Home in Nashville said Sunday that arrangements for Marty Gutzler, his wife and their 9-year-old daughter were pending.

The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew : ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto .

Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Do you have any questions?","response":"Alright little buddy, let me explain this big story in a simpler way for you! A long time ago, there was a place called Melaka. It was just a small, swampy land that wasn't very good for living. But Melaka had something special - a safe harbor near the ocean that was perfect for big ships to come and visit. One day, people from China, led by Admiral Cheng Ho, came to Melaka with a great idea. They offered to help the local ruler, Parameswara, build a nice port and give him some money. In return, they wanted his help in keeping the place safe from bad pirates called Thais. Parameswara agreed, and soon Melaka became a very important place for many different people, like traders and travelers. People started to follow a new religion called Islam, which taught them to be strong, kind and work together. Then, there was a very smart and brave man named Tun Perak, who became the leader. He helped Melaka grow even bigger and more powerful. He made sure the seas were safe from pirates and even won a big battle against the Thais! So, even though Melaka started as just a small, swampy place, it became very important and famous thanks to the hard work of people like Tun Perak and the help from friends like the Chinese.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Where are Damiel and cassel from Movie title: Wings of Desire Movie plot: Note: This film was shot in black/white and color. The Angels cannot see color. Therefore, when the shot is from the angels' point of view, the shot is black and white, and when the shot is from a human point of view, it is in color. There is much poetic language used in this film that simply cannot be properly conveyed.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is writing on a paper, When the child was a child. He goes through a series of statements about when children were children: what they thought, how they acted, etc. Then, the opening credits appear. It fades to a scene of the sky, then a close-up of a human eye, then a bird's eye view of Berlin.Damiel is looking over the city from atop a large statue. He has wings, but they disappear only a few seconds into the scene. He can hear the people below, but only the children can see him. There is a quick shot of a flapping wing, and then we see one man walking with a baby. While we see this, Damiel speaks about wanting to see color and feel alive.We hear the thoughts of a woman on a bicycle. Damiel is on an airplane, passing through the aisle. He stops to see a little girl. Then, he focuses on Peter Falk (as himself). People's voices are heard.Peter talks to himself about the writer's block he is having over his script. Peter speaks in English. A shot of Berlin is shown from the airplane's view. We hear various radio stations as we see the radio tower over Berlin. The camera pans into an apartment, and we hear various people's thoughts. Many of the things we hear are typical thoughts, or people's problems.Again, Damiel starts to think, When the child was a child. This time he is wondering what children think about. We follow Damiel around his daily routine. First, we fly once more over the city, listening to an ambulance. Then we see the pregnant woman inside the ambulance. We hear the pregnant woman's thoughts. Then, we hear the thoughts of the people in the cars around the ambulance.Damiel sits in a car with Cassiel (Otto Sander). They discuss their log books for the day. As... A:","response":"Damiel and Cassiel, portrayed by Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander, are the main angel characters in the movie \\"Wings of Desire.\\" The film, directed by Wim Wenders, was released in 1987 and set in West Berlin before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The movie combines black and white shots representing the angels' point of view and colored shots representing human interactions. Throughout the film, poetic language is employed to amplify the emotional depth of the story. Damiel and Cassiel originate from heaven, and they are depicted as angels overseeing the city of Berlin. In their otherworldly existence, they possess the power to hear people's thoughts and offer comfort in times of need. However, they are invisible to most individuals, with only children being able to see them. Despite their celestial roles, both angels grapple with their inabilities to experience life as humans do, particularly regarding feelings, sensations, and colors. At the beginning of the film, Damiel writes a series of reflections about children's thoughts and actions. This highlights his yearning to fully understand and connect with human emotions and experiences. As the movie progresses, Damiel becomes increasingly invested in the mortal realm, and he ultimately decides to give up his immortality to pursue a romantic relationship with a woman named Marion. Meanwhile, Cassiel also contemplates the nature of human existence. However, he maintains a stronger sense of duty to his angelic purpose and decides to remain in his celestial capacity, despite witnessing firsthand the desires and sufferings of the people in Berlin. In \\"Wings of Desire,\\" director Wim Wenders employs a unique filming style and narrative technique, intermingling poetic language and visuals to capture the complexity of human experience. The movie also explores themes of love, longing, and the contrast between the eternal and the ephemeral. When considering whether to invest in a film proposal like this, it is crucial to weigh the artistic merit, potential audience interest, and production costs against other factors such as market trends and competition. \\"Wings of Desire\\" received both critical and commercial success and has since become a classic in the world cinema. However, it is essential to approach each film proposal individually and analyze its potential to resonate with contemporary audiences and deliver a return on investment."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: – The latest to tussle with Donald Trump: Pope Francis. When asked Thursday about the presidential contender while returning from a six-day visit to Mexico, he responded, \\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\\" reports the New York Times. That appears to refer to Trump's promise to build a border wall between Mexico and the US (and make Mexico pay for it). The pope wouldn't weigh in on whether Americans should vote for Trump, though: \\"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\\" Trump responded quickly, notes Politico: \\"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\\" Trump also noted that \\"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’ ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all-talk, no-action politicians.\\" He said Mexico must have been talking disparagingly about him and using the pope as a \\"pawn\\" because \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" He also responded at a South Carolina rally, and made sure to note that \\"I like the pope.\\" In other news, during his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis also appeared to suggest Catholic women could use contraception if there is a concern of contracting the Zika virus, CNN reports. But abortion is still totally off the table in such a case, he said.","response":"Pope Francis vs. Donald Trump: A Clash of Ideologies In a world where political leaders and religious figures are constantly being scrutinized for their words, actions, and ideologies, a recent verbal exchange between Pope Francis and Donald Trump has caught the attention of the media. While both leaders have been known to make controversial statements, their latest disagreement shines a light on the wider social and political issues that underscore the global landscape today. Pope Francis, during an interview on his return from a six-day visit to Mexico, was asked about the American presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has been infamous for his views on immigration, specifically his idea of building a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. The Pope responded, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” as reported by the New York Times. While Pope Francis did not explicitly instruct Americans on whether to vote for Trump or not, he said, “I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.” Trump was quick to respond to Pope Francis’ comments, calling the Pontiff’s questioning of his faith “disgraceful.” Trump went on to say, “I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.” The Republican presidential candidate also added that should the Vatican ever face an attack from terrorist group ISIS, the Pope would wish that Trump had been president, as he claims that under his leadership, ISIS would have been eradicated. He further accused Mexico of using the pope as a pawn in their ongoing struggle with the United States over trade and the border issues. As one can imagine, this heated exchange between two powerful figures has drawn widespread attention and speculation. While Pope Francis’ comment on building “bridges, not walls” advocates for unity and understanding amid diversity, Trump’s stand on immigration reform highlights a more conservative approach. This back-and-forth signifies a broader ideological clash at the heart of contemporary society, as globalization continues to redefine relationships between individuals, communities, and nations. It is essential to recognize the significance of engaging in meaningful dialogue and debate, even if it brings about disagreements. An exchange between two individuals with such unique platforms and capabilities to influence change, such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump, can stimulate further reflection and discussion on vital societal issues. As the world is grappling with identity, security, and faith, different viewpoints must be acknowledged, especially when they come from world leaders like Pope Francis and potential leaders like Trump. Their exchange highlights the necessity for empathy and understanding in a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected. In other news of significance, Pope Francis also addressed the ongoing global health concern of the Zika virus during his interview. While appearing to suggest that Catholic women may use contraception to avoid pregnancy in case of potential risk from the Zika virus, he clarified that abortion remains entirely off the table. This latest exchange, in the end, only underscores the importance of discussion and dialogue in today's connected world. As ideologies clash and the world continues to change, the contrasting viewpoints of leaders such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump serve as catalysts for reflection on our shared human condition."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A younger man is putting liquid into a vile.\\" is it true that \\"The young man pours liquid into a vile.\\"?

The Nationals right-hander is scheduled to have his second MRI exam in less than a week as the team tries to gather more information about the strained flexor tendon in his right forearm that sent Strasburg to the disabled list. This will be an \\"enhanced\\" MRI exam in which dye will be injected to give a more detailed look at the area in question. As the Nationals and baseball fans wait for the results, Will Carroll, Stephania Bell and others like them try to fill the void with analysis, insight and some speculation. Carroll writes a column for Baseball Prospectus called \\"Under The Knife\\" and has a video with a thorough and easy-to-understand explanation of Strasburg's injury. Bell is a physical therapist who provides injury analysis for ESPN.com. They both agree that Strasburg is unlikely to return this season. The second MRI exam will presumably show whether the injury is more severe than a strain, and that could create one of two scenarios: The ideal result is there is nothing in Strasburg's forearm beyond a strain and he just needs to rest. That scenario, too, could mean the Nationals opt to sit him for the remainder of this season. Joe Posnanski of Sports Illustrated is no injury expert, but the Strasburg injury is nothing new to him. Writes Posnanski: The arm isn't built to throw a baseball as hard as Strasburg throws it. The arm isn't built to make a baseball do the things that Strasburg can make it do. ...

I was excited to try the restaurant after hearing about its exquisite Italian cuisine and warm atmosphere. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Bella's Bistro to anyone due to the poor service, substandard dishes, and lack of cleanliness. Upon entering the restaurant, the host's attitude was far from welcoming, more akin to an inconvenience. Even though we had a reservation, our table was not ready, forcing us to wait an additional 20 minutes in the cramped entryway. The hostess showed little interest in accommodating our needs or checking on us during the wait, further dampening our excitement for the evening. Once we were shown to our table, the inattentiveness continued with our server. It took him more than 15 minutes to take our drink orders, leaving us parched and frustrated. Despite being well-versed in wine, our server seemed to lack knowledge about the menu, providing vague answers to our questions and making poor recommendations that failed to take our preferences into account. When our appetizers finally arrived, the presentation was underwhelming, and sadly, the taste matched. I ordered the classic bruschetta, but instead of the anticipated fresh, juicy tomatoes, I discovered a soggy, tasteless mess of bread and watery tomatoes. My dining companion's calamari was oversalted and rubbery, making it almost inedible. For our main course, I opted for the highly-recommended seafood linguine, while my companion chose the eggplant Parmesan. Upon tasting the dishes, it quickly became apparent that the seafood in my linguine was not fresh. The shrimp tasted off and had a questionable odor, while the clams were clearly overcooked. My companion's eggplant Parmesan had layers of oil-saturated eggplant, giving the dish a greasy texture that was far from enjoyable, and the sauce was overly acidic, lacking the richness one would expect from a classic Italian dish. Throughout the meal, the service continued to be substandard. The server disappeared for long stretches of time, making it difficult to request drink refills or condiments, and never once checked to see if we were satisfied with our dishes. It was only upon completion that our server paid attention to us, pressuring us to order dessert despite our clear reluctance due to the poor preceding courses. To make matters worse, I could not ignore the general lack of cleanliness in the establishment. The floors were littered with crumbs and napkins from previous diners, and the restrooms were in dire need of attention, with minimal supplies and unclean facilities. In summary, my experience at Bella's Bistro was a major disappointment. The service was abysmal, the dishes were below average both in taste and presentation, and the general lack of cleanliness was off-putting. Regrettably, I feel compelled to advise anyone considering Bella's Bistro to look elsewhere for an enjoyable and satisfying Italian dining experience."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"Let me provide you with an example of a movie review for the film \\"Inception\\" directed by Christopher Nolan.

Another factory worker takes a seat inside the vehicle; he will be found dead afterwords.Present day, September 16, 1978 in Northern California. Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a meek teenager who spends his weekends playing Scrabble with his parents (Christine Belford and Richard Darnell), who still treat him as a child. Arnie and his best friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) are going to their school, as usual. Arnie is clumsy, and his black-rimmed glasses characterize him as being nerdy. Dennis is a football player, who still befriends Arnie and tries to stand up for him.During shop class, Arnie is bullied by several students led by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander).

Context: Apologies again that it’s been a while since I last posted. You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Does it follow that \\"The Clinton supporters were to be admired. \\"? OPTIONS: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","response":"[II] it is not possible to tell The statement \\"The Clinton surrogates also held the high ground in the context war.\\" suggests that the supporters of Clinton were effective in framing the political discussions in a way that benefits their candidate, by holding the high ground in the context war. However, this statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the Clinton supporters should be admired or not. Admiration is a subjective emotion that is often tied to one's personal values, beliefs, and perceptions. One person may admire the Clinton surrogates for their ability to seize the high ground in the context war, while another person may disapprove of their tactics or not be impressed by their success. In addition, the term \\"high ground\\" is open to interpretation. It could mean that the Clinton supporters were more successful in shaping the narrative or it could mean that they took a more morally or ethically superior stance in the debates and discussions. Depending on these interpretations, one's admiration for the Clinton surrogates may differ. Furthermore, the statement is limited in scope and does not provide a holistic view of the Clinton supporters' actions, their motivations, or their impact on the political landscape. It would be helpful to know more about the specific tactics they employed, the issues they prioritized, and how these choices influenced public opinion and voter behavior. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"The Clinton supporters were to be admired.\\" One needs more context and information on their actions, motivations, and consequences to make a well-informed determination about the level of admiration that they may deserve."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate.

It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier.

Available options: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","response":"Based on the information provided in the statement \\"Two girls walking in the ocean,\\" it is difficult to conclude with certainty that \\"There are girls on the beach.\\" The reason for this is that the statement only focuses on the girls being in the ocean and does not explicitly mention their location on the beach. Therefore, the most appropriate answer from the available options would be b). It is not possible to tell. It is worth mentioning that while people often associate walking in the ocean with being near the beach, this statement does not establish a connection between the girls and the beach itself. They could be walking in shallow waters near the shore, they could have accessed the ocean from a boat, or they could be in deeper waters away from the beach. Although it is reasonable to assume that if someone is walking in the ocean, they might have accessed the water from the beach, there might be other possibilities as well. To draw a more definitive conclusion, we would need additional information or context that links the girls' presence in the ocean to being on the beach. For example, \\"Two girls were seen walking in the ocean near the beach\\" or \\"Two girls walked into the ocean from the beach.\\" In such cases, it would be appropriate to select option a). Yes. In summary, based on the given statement, it is not possible to tell whether there are girls on the beach, and the appropriate answer choice would be b). It is not possible to tell.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture.

In the 19th-century, it was used in a much narrower sense by English writers to discuss developments in the early Italian libretto, e.g., \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\". Characteristic are the influence of French bourgeois drama, female instead of male protagonists, and the practice of opening the action with a chorus. - Opera seria (plural: \\"opere serie\\"; usually called \\"dramma per musica\\" or \\"melodramma serio\\") is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and \\"serious\\" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once \\"opera seria\\" was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as a historical genre. The popular rival to \\"opera seria\\" was \\"opera buffa,\\" the 'comic' opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte. - Italian Baroque (or \\"Barocco\\") is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Thésée (\\"Theseus\\") is a \\"tragédie en musique\\", an early type of French opera, in a prologue and five acts with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and a libretto by Philippe Quinault based on Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\". It was first performed on 11 January 1675 by the Paris Opera for the royal court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was first performed in public in April at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris. - The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a royal palace in the commune of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in the \\"département\\" of Yvelines, about 19 km west of Paris, France. Today, it houses the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale (National Museum of Archaeology). - Ottone, re di Germania (\\"Otto, King of Germany\\", HWV 15) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, to an Italianlanguage libretto adapted by Nicola Francesco Haym from the libretto by Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino for Antonio Lotti's opera \\"Teofane\\". It was the first new opera written for the Royal Academy of Music (1719)'s fourth season and had its first performance on 12 January 1723 at the King's Theatre, Haymarket in London. Handel had assembled a cast of operatic superstars for this season and the opera became an enormous success. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - The Paris Opera() is the primary opera company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV as the , and shortly thereafter was placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the ', but continued to be known more simply as the . Classical ballet as we know it today arose within the Paris Opera as the Paris Opera Ballet and has remained an integral and important part of the company. Currently called the ', it mainly produces operas at its modern 2700-seat theatre Opéra Bastille which opened in 1989, and ballets and some classical operas at the older 1970-seat Palais Garnier which opened in 1875. Small scale and contemporary works are also staged in the 500-seat Amphitheatre under the Opéra Bastille. - Teseo ( \`\` Theseus '' , HWV 9 ; Italian pronunciation : ( tezo ) ) is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel , the only Handel opera that is in five acts . The Italian - language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym , after Philippe Quinault 's Thésée .

First performed on 10 January 1713,Teseo featured \`\` magical '' effects such as flying dragons , transformation scenes and apparitions and had a cast of notable Italian opera singers . It was a success with London audiences , receiving thirteen performances even though the stage machinery for the \`\` magical '' effects broke down , and would have received more performances had not one of the theatre 's managers run away with the box office receipts . - Flavio, re de' Longobardi (\\"Flavio, King of the Lombards\\", HWV 16) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's \\"Flavio Cuniberto\\". It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music. Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera. - Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars. - Dramma per musica (Italian, literally: \\"drama for music\\", plural: \\"drammi per musica\\") is a term which was used by dramatists in Italy and elsewhere between the late-17th and mid-19th centuries. In modern times the same meaning of \\"drama for music\\" was conveyed through the Italian Greek-rooted word \\"melodramma\\" (from = song or music + = scenic action). \\"Dramma per musica\\" never meant \\"drama \\"through\\" music\\", let alone music drama. - Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon. - Nicola Francesco Haym (6 July 1678 31 July 1729) was an Italian opera librettist, composer, theatre manager and performer, and numismatist.

Libretti that he provided for Handel included those for \\"Giulio Cesare\\", \\"Ottone\\", \\"Flavio\\", \\"Tamerlano\\", \\"Rodelinda\\", and several others; for Bononcini, he produced two, \\"Calfurnia\\" and \\"Astianatte\\". - An organ concerto is a piece of music, an instrumental concerto for a pipe organ soloist with an orchestra. The form first evolves in the 18th century, when composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel wrote organ concertos with small orchestras, and with solo parts which rarely call for the organ pedal board. During the Classical period organ concerto became popular in many places, especially in Bavaria, Austria and Bohemia (whether called there a concerto, pastorella, or sonata), reaching a position of being almost an integral part of the church music tradition of \\"jubilus\\" character. From the Romantic era fewer works are known. Finally, there are some 20th- and 21st-century examples, of which the concerto by Francis Poulenc has entered the basic repertoire, and is quite frequently played. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Tamerlano (\\"Tamerlane\\", HWV 18) is an opera seria in three acts written for the Royal Academy of Music theatre company, with music by George Frideric Handel to an Italian text by Nicola Francesco Haym, adapted from Agostin Piovene's \\"Tamerlano\\" together with another libretto entitled \\"Bajazet\\" after Nicolas Pradon's \\"Tamerlan, ou La Mort de Bajazet\\". - Tragédie en musique (Musical tragedy), also known as tragédie lyrique (French lyric tragedy), is a genre of French opera introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lully and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending in fact, they generally don't but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \\"tragédie en musique\\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\\"petits airs\\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \\"divertissement\\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons. - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] 14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Giulio Cesare in Egitto (Italian for \\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\", HWV 17), commonly known as Giulio Cesare, is a dramma per musica (\\"opera seria\\") in three acts composed for the Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas. Composition history. \\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" was first performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell's new one, called Jules César in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670 9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers. - Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661. - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists. - Opera buffa (plural: \\"opere buffe\\"; Italian for \\"comic opera\\") is a genre of opera. It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as \\"commedia in musica\\", \\"commedia per musica\\", \\"dramma bernesco\\", \\"dramma comico\\", \\"divertimento giocoso\\". - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The characters of the \\"\\" usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains. The characters are exaggerated \\"real characters\\", such as a know it all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati. - In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.

My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box. Summary: Excellent tea!

Step 3: Analyze the information The review talks about the high quality of the tea and its taste. It also mentions criticism about the number of sachets in the box and how it is not enough. Step 4: Compare the review and summary The summary simply states \\"Excellent tea!\\". While it does capture the overall positive sentiment of the review, it does not address the criticism mentioned about the number of sachets in the box, which is a crucial part of the reviewer's perspective. Step 5: Determine if the review and summary match Based on the comparison, the summary partially matches the review but misses an important aspect. So, the answer is: A: False"},{"question":"Title: Most boring narrator ever.

The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. Question: \\"When did Dulles detect a primary target that triggered them to alert Reagan National Airport?\\" Response: \\"9:25\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Options are: [i] no [ii] yes","response":"[i] no"},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person Black Francis told he was keen to record again? While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became \\"a lot more spontaneous\\" while recording the...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Far Country Context: In 1896, Jeff Webster (James Stewart) sees the start of the Klondike gold rush as a golden opportunity to make a fortune in beef. He and his friend Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) drive a cattle herd from Wyoming to Seattle, by ship to Skagway and through the mountains to Dawson City.On the way, he annoys town boss and self-appointed Skagway judge Gannon (John McIntire) by interrupting a hanging. Webster ends up being taken into custody and jailed. He meets French-Canadian gamine Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet) at the jail, when she brings supper to his cell mate. Renee immediately takes a liking to Webster and flirts with him.Webster doesn't have to wait long for trial, and he's escorted to the saloon to meet with the judge. Renee goes along and Webster calls her \\"Freckle Face,\\" which irritates her. Judge Gannon asks him who he shot. Webster explains it was two men who took it upon themselves to combine his herd with theirs. The judge agrees that was justified, so he dismisses the case, but he also tells Webster his cows are being confiscated for disturbance of the peace, among other things. Webster wants to take issue with that, but he realizes he's badly outnumbered, and justice usually goes to the strongest at the time.The owner of the saloon, a woman named Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), asks the judge why he confiscated Webster's cattle. \\"Because I wanted them,\\" he says.Webster and Tatum decide to make for the Klondike, even though they lost their cattle, and begin making preparations. Ronda just happens to be heading up a party bound for Alaska with the cows and she offers Webster a job as her trail boss. Since Webster and Tatum are down to their last 50, and it requires a minimum 100 in food and supplies to receive permission from Judge Gannon to head up the trail, Webster agrees to the job. Plus, he's obviously attracted to Ms. Castle and her to him.Not long into their trip, Webster, Tatum and Ben Rube (Jay C. Flippen), slip off during the night, and take off with the cattle. Gannon and his men pursue. After...","response":"In the movie \\"The Far Country,\\" Dawson becomes much more dangerous primarily due to the presence and actions of the following characters: 1. Judge Gannon – Played by John McIntire, Gannon is the town boss and self-appointed Skagway judge. His authoritative and manipulative nature poses a significant threat to the people of Dawson. By confiscating Jeff Webster's cattle and other means, he exercises his power and control over the town. His relentless pursuit of Webster and the cattle only adds to the danger. 2. Ronda Castle – Portrayed by Ruth Roman, Ronda Castle is the owner of the saloon who strikes a business deal with Webster. Her cunning and manipulative nature plays a significant role in making Dawson more dangerous. Though attracted to Webster, her determination to get what she wants, coupled with her alliance with Gannon, makes her a force to be reckoned with in Dawson. 3. Jeff Webster – Played by James Stewart, Jeff Webster is an ambitious cattle driver hoping to capitalize on the Klondike gold rush. His actions, including interrupting Gannon's hanging and stealing back his confiscated cattle, create friction between him and Gannon, resulting in a risky situation for all those involved. His refusal to submit to Gannon's authority and his willingness to fight back contributes to the town's dangerous atmosphere. Other factors contributing to Dawson's dangerous nature include the harsh environment and the gold rush's impact on the characters. Many are driven to extreme measures in pursuit of fortune, leading to a volatile, treacherous environment. The lust for gold and power brings out the worst in individuals, creating conflicts and tension among the townspeople. Moreover, characters such as Renee Vallon, played by Corinne Calvet, and Ben Tatum, portrayed by Walter Brennan, are caught in the middle of the chaos and danger caused by the aforementioned characters. Their loyalties are tested as the stakes grow higher, adding to Dawson's perilous atmosphere. In summary, the characters Judge Gannon, Ronda Castle, and Jeff Webster, as well as the gold rush's impact, significantly contribute to making Dawson much more dangerous in the movie \\"The Far Country.\\" The power struggle between these characters and the underlying tension among the townspeople, exacerbated by the harsh environment and the chase for wealth, creates a highly dangerous and volatile situation in the town of Dawson."},{"question":"A Paul Zindel's death on March 27,2003 ended the brilliant life of a famous writer.

Article:","response":"Title: Kelly Gissendaner's Execution and Last Meal Request in Jackson, Georgia Kelly Gissendaner, the woman convicted for a 1997 murder plot involving her husband, is scheduled to face the death penalty by lethal injection at 7 pm on Wednesday in Jackson, Georgia. Gissendaner will make a last-ditch effort on Tuesday to commute her death sentence in what seems to be a dire situation. In preparation for her final moments, Gissendaner has requested a massive last meal that consists of two Burger King Whoppers with cheese, cornbread, fries, and cherry vanilla ice cream. This request marks a significant moment in Gissendaner's life, as her time is seemingly coming to an end. The crime which concluded with Gissendaner's death sentence involved persuading her then-lover, Gregory Owen, to kidnap and stab her husband to death. After the murder had been carried out, Gissendaner helped Owen in burning her husband's car to destroy any evidence that could be traced back to them. However, their efforts proved futile, as they were both apprehended and convicted for their involvement in the crime. While Gissendaner faces the death penalty for her actions, her accomplice, Gregory Owen, has been serving a life sentence behind bars. The contrast in their punishment raises questions about the fairness and application of justice in the case. Kelly Gissendaner's impending execution and her final meal request serve as an ominous reminder of the consequences of crime and the ongoing debate surrounding the use of the death penalty in the United States."},{"question":"Sarah's external drive showed 2.4 gigabytes free and 12.6 gigabytes used. She decided to delete a folder of size 4.6 gigabytes and store new files of 2 gigabytes. If she will transfer all her files to a new external drive of size 20 gigabytes, how many free gigabytes will the new external drive have? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate the available space on Sarah's current external drive before she deletes the folder. To do this, add the free space (2.4 GB) to the used space (12.6 GB): 2.4 GB (free space) + 12.6 GB (used space) = 15 GB (total capacity) Step 2: Calculate the remaining space after she deletes the folder of 4.6 GB: To do this, subtract the folder size (4.6 GB) from the used space (12.6 GB): 12.6 GB (used space) - 4.6 GB (folder size) = 8 GB (new used space) Step 3: Calculate the space used after Sarah adds the new 2 GB files: To do this, add the new files' size (2 GB) to the new used space (8 GB) 8 GB (new used space) + 2 GB (new files) = 10 GB (updated used space) Step 4: Calculate the free space on the new 20 GB external drive: To do this, subtract the updated used space (10 GB) from the new external drive's total capacity (20 GB) 20 GB (new external drive's capacity) - 10 GB (updated used space) = 10 GB (free space on the new external drive) So, after transferring the files to the new 20-gigabyte external drive, Sarah will have 10 gigabytes of free space."},{"question":"Please answer this question: What date in the western Gregorian Calendar is currently the date for the Russian Orthodox Church Christian New Year?","response":"The Russian Orthodox Church, like some other Orthodox Churches, uses the Julian calendar, which is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar (used by most of the western world), due to the different way the two calendars calculate the length of the year. This translates into some differences between the dates of some Christian festivals in the West and in Eastern Orthodox Churches. For instance, Christmas is celebrated by the Russian Orthodox Church on January 7th of the Gregorian Calendar, whereas most Western Christian Churches celebrate it on December 25th. When it comes to the New Year, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates its Christian New Year (also known as the Orthodox New Year or the Old New Year) on January 14th of the Gregorian calendar. In Russia, this day is considered a memorable day, usually without lavish celebrations linked to secular New Year's Eve, but more as a day of reflection, prayer, and quiet celebration. It marks the start of the Julian New Year, which falls on January 1st in the Julian calendar (equivalent to January 14th in the Gregorian calendar), acknowledging the first day of the civil year in the Julian calendar used by the Roman Empire until 1582. However, it should be noted that while the liturgical year in the Russian Orthodox Church still follows the Julian calendar, the church, like the rest of Russian society, also recognizes the civil new year on January 1st of the Gregorian calendar. This is a more secular celebration and aligns with New Year's Eve and New Year's Day public holidays in other parts of the world. In summary, while the Russian Orthodox Church and society celebrate the New Year on January 1st as per the Gregorian Calendar, the so-called Orthodox New Year based on the Julian calendar falls on January 14th in the Gregorian calendar."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: On a summer day, John was sitting on a beach in Hawaii with his parents.

His surprised parents replied that he was lucky, since a lot of kids didn't have any toys at all. \\"How can that be?\\" John said, confused, but then he said that he would like to get toys for those children. His parents naturally thought their son was just kidding. But as soon as they returned home, John began using his pocket money to buy toys for other kids and asking his friends to do the same. His parents responded by organizing pizza suppers for other families interested in helping other children that can't afford to buy toys. John thought that he just wanted to cheer those kids up. John's parents started to find a place that would allow children as young as six and seven to volunteer. They finally find a day care center for disabled children to let John and his friends visit.

Now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal. This movie is Miss Novak's Golden Moment.She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence. She completely dominates the amiable Mr J.Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie.Misses E.Lanchester and H.Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E. Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.Mr J.Lemmon plays Miss Novak's brother.He is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream.Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later.Certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one.

For larger bubble clusters, it may be easier to use a floor buffer. Locate the area of your floor with bubbles, and place the sander over top for 5-15 seconds. Move on to the next area until all bubbles are sanded. Palm sanders cost 14 a day (£9.94) or 56 (£39.76) a week to rent. You can rent a floor buffer for about 33 a day (£23.43) or 120 a week (£85.19). Sanding over your floor scratches up the bubbles, making it easy to apply a fresh coat of epoxy. You can rent a sand blaster to remove all of the epoxy coating. Connect your sand blaster to the air compressor and your watering hose. Turn it on and select the medium or hard blasting option. Then, start at the edge of your floor, and pull the trigger to release the sand. Walk your blaster in a straight line across your floor, and continue until all of your epoxy is removed. The sand blaster shoots finely ground silica at your floor very quickly, and this removes any unwanted substance from your floor. You will need to rent an air compressor as well as the blaster and purchase sand to use. In total, this will cost about 100 (£70.96 for the day). Make sure your sand blaster is full of silica, and fill up the holding tank if needed. Using a shop vac, go around your floor and get rid of all dust and debris so it doesn’t get trapped in your epoxy. After you vacuum up as much dust as possible, pour some solvent onto a clean rag, and wipe the entirety of your sanded floor. Solvents help the epoxy adhere to your floor evenly, which prevents bubbles from emerging. Solvents come in many varieties, but for great results you can use a heavy-duty degreaser specifically for epoxy. It costs about 10 (£7.10) at most home supply stores. Once you sand away all the bubbles and clean up any dust, you can easily recoat your epoxy. Touch up small repair areas, or recoat your entire floor, depending on how much of your floor had bubbles. Use a 3⁄4 in (1.9 cm) wide roller, and pour your well-mixed epoxy into a paint tray. Spread the epoxy over your floor starting in the back and working your way towards the front. Apply your epoxy in thin, even layers for best results. If you want to apply additional coats, wait 24 hours for your epoxy to dry. What is a summary?","response":"A summary of the article is as follows: To repair epoxy floors with bubbles, use a palm sander (for small bubble groups) or a floor buffer (for larger clusters).

McMahon and Johnny Carson began their long association in their first TV series, the ABC game show Who Do You Trust?, running from 1957 to 1962. Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's highly successfully The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Budweiser\\" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number of appearances. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1998, when Clark decided to move production of the series to ABC. In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Clause on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977. He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories.

Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted \\"prize patrol\\".) Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com Jelly as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne.

Paris, France (CNN) -- French police are searching the home of the daughter of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, a spokeswoman from the prosecutor's office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre told CNN Wednesday. Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, went to court last month accusing a photographer of bilking her mother out of a billion euros. Bettencourt, who is France's richest woman, allegedly gave the money to the photographer, but her daughter says she is not mentally competent to handle her own affairs. At the same time, police are investigating claims that Bettencourt's adviser gave envelopes of cash to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Labor Minister Eric Woerth.Police questioned Liliane Bettencourt on Monday. Among other claims is that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign received money from OPTIONS: - Bettencourt in excess of campaign finance limits. - CNN in excess of campaign finance limits. - Eric Woerth.Police in excess of campaign finance limits. - France in excess of campaign finance limits. - Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers in excess of campaign finance limits. - French in excess of campaign finance limits. - L'Oreal in excess of campaign finance limits. - Labor in excess of campaign finance limits. - Liliane Bettencourt in excess of campaign finance limits. - Nanterre in excess of campaign finance limits. - Nicolas Sarkozy in excess of campaign finance limits. - Paris in excess of campaign finance limits.","response":"Among other claims is that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign received money from Bettencourt in excess of campaign finance limits. This allegation, if proven true, could have serious consequences for Sarkozy and his political party, as well as implicating Bettencourt in illegal activities. The Bettencourt scandal has garnered significant media attention in France and raises concerns about political corruption and the influence of wealthy individuals in politics. Reports suggest that Bettencourt's financial advisor, Patrice de Maistre, may have facilitated the alleged illegal campaign contributions. If the allegations against Bettencourt and Sarkozy are proven true, there could be legal consequences for both parties. In France, campaign finance laws are designed to limit the influence of money in politics and to create a level playing field for all candidates. By accepting contributions in excess of the legal limits, Sarkozy's 2007 campaign would have violated these regulations, potentially leading to fines, loss of public funding, and damage to the reputation of the individuals involved. The police investigation into these claims has raised questions about the relationship between Bettencourt and Sarkozy. Some have speculated that Bettencourt's generous donations were an attempt to buy political influence and ensure favorable treatment for her business interests. Additionally, the scandal has also cast a negative light on Bettencourt's competence to manage her own financial affairs. The allegations made by her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, have prompted a separate investigation into whether Liliane Bettencourt is indeed capable of making well-informed financial decisions. This could have significant repercussions for the Bettencourt family and the L'Oreal company if it is determined that Bettencourt is not capable of managing her own finances. The Bettencourt scandal illustrates the complex interaction between wealth, power, and politics. While the police investigation is ongoing, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency in political financing and the dangers of allowing wealthy individuals to wield disproportionate influence in political matters. The outcome of these investigations could have lasting implications for those involved and for the political landscape in France more broadly."},{"question":"What's the most secure iOS messenging app?

One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com. The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware. You can find this by clicking the \\"File\\" menu and selecting \\"Settings,\\" or by clicking the \\"Settings\\" button in the main window. This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at: Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file. Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer. Recording Format - By default, this will be set to \\"flv.\\" You may want to select \\"mp4\\" for maximum compatibility. This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game. You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key. There are several things you might want to change before starting to record: Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution. Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting. If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held. Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings. This will create a new Game Capture entry in the Sources list. Once you've got OBS configured, you can start playing your game. You can play any game on your computer from any source, including Steam, Origin, or games installed on their own. You won't receive any indication that recording has begun, but OBS will be recording in the background. Again, you won't receive a notification that recording has stopped. The video file will be created, and you'll be able to find it at the location you set earlier.","response":"This article is about how to record your gameplay on a computer using a free program called Open Broadcast Software (OBS).

Ronstadt Co., and Ruth Mary (Copeman) Ronstadt (1914-1982), a homemaker. Ronstadt was raised on the family's 10-acre (4 ha) ranch with her siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's Chief of Police for 10 years, 1981-1991), Michael J., and Gretchen (Suzy). The family was featured in Family Circle magazine in 1953. Linda's father came from a pioneering Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including Mexican music, which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood. Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records - rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi - is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of Gilbert and Sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and Great American Songbook repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation. Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as Lola Beltran and Edith Piaf; she has called their singing and rhythms \\"more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 time signature ... very hard driving and very intense.\\" She also drew influence from country singer Hank Williams. She has said that \\"all girl singers\\" eventually \\"have to curtsy to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday\\". Of Maria Callas, Ronstadt says, \\"There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays. ... She's the greatest chick singer ever.\\" She admires Callas for her musicianship and her attempts to push 20th-century singing, particularly opera, back into the bel canto \\"natural style of singing\\". A self-described product of American radio of the 1950s and 1960s, Ronstadt is a fan of its eclectic and diverse music programming. What was her earliest influence ?","response":"Linda Ronstadt's earliest influences were the music and traditions from her family life.

And the answer is?","response":"The third year in which England had three kings is 1483. This year witnessed a succession of monarchs in a short span of time, similar to the years 1066 and 1936. The three kings who reigned in 1483 were Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. 1. Edward IV: Edward IV was the first king of the year 1483. He was born in 1442 and came to power as the King of England on March 4, 1461, after deposing King Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. Edward's reign was marked by the restoration of law and order, as well as significant advancements in trade and commerce. His second reign began on April 11, 1471, after reclaiming the throne from Henry VI. He continued to rule until his sudden death on April 9, 1483. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son Edward V. 2. Edward V: Edward V's reign was extremely brief, lasting from April 9 to June 25, 1483. He was never actually crowned king because his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, declared Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, as illegitimate based on the assertion that their father, Edward IV, had entered a pre-contract of marriage with another woman before marrying their mother, Elizabeth Woodville. As a result, Edward V's coronation was postponed, and he and his brother were placed in the Tower of London, where they were eventually declared illegitimate by Parliament through an act called \\"Titulus Regius.\\" The two boys, known in history as the \\"Princes in the Tower,\\" disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and their fate remains a subject of speculation and debate among historians. 3. Richard III: Richard III, the Duke of Gloucester, and brother of Edward IV, became the King of England on June 26, 1483, after deposing his nephew Edward V. He ruled until his death on August 22, 1485, at the Battle of Bosworth Field against Henry Tudor (who later became King Henry VII). This battle marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. In conclusion, the third year in which England had three kings is 1483, with the successive reigns of Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. This year was marked by political intrigue, power struggles, and family drama that ultimately led to the establishment of the Tudor dynasty."},{"question":"WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. According to the above context, answer the following question. President Trump's vow to end Immigration Crisis will probably take: Options: a). A day or two.. b). The duration of his Presidency to achieve. c). About an hour.. d). not enough information. Answer:","response":"b). The duration of his Presidency to achieve. The given information describes President Trump's commitment to a tough approach on immigration policy and securing the borders in order to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" This implies that the immigration crisis is a complex and long-standing issue that would likely take significant time and effort to resolve. Given Trump's determined approach and the fact that policy changes and implementation can take a substantial amount of time, it is reasonable to assume that ending the immigration crisis might extend throughout the duration of his Presidency. The other options provided, such as a day or two, or about an hour, are unrealistic time frames for achieving a solution to such a complicated matter.

To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Question 2: How can I use select expert in crystal report so that the user enters a name and only that record appears? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"Hello little one! No, the answers to these two questions will be different because they are about two completely different topics. Let me help you understand each of them. Question 1: To report a violation in a multinational pharmaceutical company after the internal report was neglected, you can follow these steps: 1. Find out if the company has a hotline or an external reporting service you can contact. Many companies have this to report any issues, problems, or concerns. 2. If you can't find that, you can talk to a grown-up you trust - maybe your parents or a teacher. They can help you reach out to the local authorities or other regulatory bodies that oversee the company. 3. Alternatively, you can also ask your trusted grown-up to help you contact a lawyer or an investigative journalist to look into the issue you are concerned about. Now, let's talk about Question 2, which is about a special computer program called Crystal Report. In Crystal Report, there is a feature called 'Select Expert' that can help you find just the information you want to see. When you want to see only the records related to a specific name, follow these steps: 1. Open the Select Expert by clicking on its button or going to the menu called \\"Report\\" and choosing \\"Select Expert.\\" 2. In Select Expert, choose the field you want to use, like a \\"Name\\" field. 3. Pick a comparison operator. You would want to choose \\"is equal to\\" because you're trying to find a record that matches a specific name. 4. In the next box, you or the person using the report will enter the name they want to see. 5. Click on 'OK,' and Crystal Report will show you only the records with that name. So, you see, the answers to these two questions are different because they deal with different topics - one is about reporting a violation in a company, and the other is about using a computer program to find specific information."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: the tracks listed for this CD is incorrect.

Nor are police shedding light on a possible motive, disclosing only that one of the two men—James White, 38, and Justin Mann, 24— knew one of the victims, reports the Albany Times Union. Killed were Shanta Myers, 36; her children, 11-year-old Jeremiah and 5-year-old Shanise; and her partner, Brandi Mells, 22. There might have been one more victim, but Myers' 15-year-old son, Isaiah Smith, was out of town when the murders took place. Now, a GoFundMe page has raised more than 40,000 to pay for a scholarship for the teen, as well as to cover funeral expenses. Both men face charges of first-degree murder, which could see them sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole. White received 11 years in state prison in 2000 for first-degree manslaughter, while Mann got 5 years in 2010 for first-degree robbery, reports the Daily Gazette. Police sources tell the Times Union that footage from security cameras around Troy led to the arrests. That raises the possibility that the Schenectady men used public transportation because local buses have high-res video cameras. The four victims were found bound in their basement apartment, with their throats slashed.

The victims, Shanta Myers (36), her two children Jeremiah (11) and Shanise (5), and her partner Brandi Mells (22), were found brutally murdered in their basement apartment with their throats slashed. A possible motive is still unclear, and the police have only revealed that one of the arrested suspects was acquainted with one of the victims. Isaiah Smith (15), Shanta Myers' son, narrowly missed being a victim as he was out of town at the time. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise funds for a scholarship for the teen and to cover funeral expenses for the victims. So far, the page has raised over 40,000. Both suspects, White and Mann, face charges of first-degree murder, which, if convicted, would put them behind bars for life without the possibility of parole. White has previously served 11 years in state prison for first-degree manslaughter, while Mann received a 5-year sentence for first-degree robbery.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. and the situation: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system. Answer the following question: Wich comet would not be visible to naked eyes on February 19, 2022, Comet A or Comet B? The answer to this question is:","response":"Comet A would not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022. This is because Comet A is described as being very faint, which typically means it would be difficult or impossible to see without the aid of a telescope. Furthermore, on February 19, 2022, Comet A would still be within the inner solar system but would be about to leave on February 20, 2022. Despite its location within the inner solar system, its faintness would prevent it from being visible to the naked eye. On the contrary, Comet B, which is described as being very bright, would be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022, especially given that this date falls within its time in the inner solar system, as it enters on February 18, 2022, and leaves on February 26, 2022."},{"question":"Premise: \\"Guy in white fuzzy jacket plays guitar while a man in purple button up sings.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man wearing a white fuzzy jacket is playing the guitar for the man in purple who is singing.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country. The reasons for his detention remain unclear. The following year, he became a naturalized American citizen. Answer:","response":"Joseph Szigeti"},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Polish.

Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is a method that uses the natural ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight to purify the water, making it safe for drinking. When water-filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are exposed to sunlight for several hours, the UV rays inactivate harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, that can cause waterborne diseases. SODIS works through a combination of three factors: UV radiation, thermal effects, and the photocatalytic properties of the PET bottle. 1. UV Radiation: The UV-A radiation (wavelength 320-400 nm) present in sunlight destroys the harmful microorganisms by altering their genetic material (DNA and RNA), which prevents them from reproducing, ultimately leading to their inactivation. Direct sunlight also contains a small proportion of UV-B and UV-C radiation, which further enhances the disinfection process. 2. Thermal Effects: As the water-filled PET bottles are exposed to sunlight, they absorb and retain heat. When the water temperature reaches above 50°C (122°F), the combined effect of UV radiation and increased temperature accelerates the inactivation of microorganisms. Although SODIS is not primarily based on heat, the thermal effects contribute to the process in warm and sunny conditions. 3. Photocatalytic Properties: The PET bottles have photocatalytic properties, which means they can initiate chemical reactions upon exposure to sunlight. When sunlight interacts with the PET material and oxygen dissolved in the water, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated. These ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, can damage the outer membrane and vital structures of the microorganisms, subsequently inactivating them. The exposure time for SODIS varies depending on the weather and climate, ranging from a minimum of six hours on a sunny day to two days during fully overcast conditions. The World Health Organization recommends SODIS as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage, particularly in developing countries where access to clean drinking water is limited. It is a simple, affordable, and environmentally friendly solution, currently helping over two million people to access safe drinking water."},{"question":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

However, to provide a detailed and long answer, let us analyze the given information. Yingxiu Town in Wenchuan was affected by a disaster, and the sentence provides information about the number of survivors and the unaccounted population. The sentence mentions that 3,000 survivors were found. Additionally, it states that the status of other inhabitants (around 9,000) remained unclear. This implies that these 9,000 people are unaccounted for at the time of the report. It is crucial to note that the numbers provided are approximate, as they use the word \\"around\\" for both survivors and unclear inhabitants. This means that the actual numbers of survivors and unaccounted people could be slightly more or less than the numbers mentioned. However, based on the given information, we can confidently say that around 9,000 people were still unaccounted for in Yingxiu Town, Wenchuan, as per the commander's report.

The technology that was supposed to simplify our lives has become the vital time-suck: the average teen spends more than seven hours a day using technological devices, plus an additional hour just text-messaging friends. The advantage of technological devices is connectedness: email lets us respond on the go, and we are in touch with more people during more hours of the day than at any other time in history. But is it possible we're more lonely than ever, too? That's what MIT professor Sherry Turkle observes in her new book, Alone Together, a fascinating portrait of our changing relationship with technology. Turkle details the ways technology has redefined our comprehension of closeness and loneliness--and warns us of the danger of accepting such virtual relationships in place of lasting emotional connections. For Turkle, the biggest worry is the effect all these shallow connections have on our development. Is technology offering us the lives we want to live? \\"We're texting people at a distance,\\" says Turkle, \\"We're using lifeless objects to convince ourselves that even when we're alone, we feel together. And then when we're with each other, we put ourselves in situations where we are alone--constantly on our mobile devices. It's what I call a perfect storm of confusion about what's important in our human connections.\\" What can't be denied is that technology, whatever its faults, makes life a whole lot easier. It allows us to communicate with more people in less time and makes conversation simple. But it can also be seductive , providing more stimulation than our natural lives. There are usually some unhealthy videos online which remove teenagers' attention from their schoolwork. Besides, some online activities make people addicted, which occupied their daily life and affected their ability to form real-world relationships.\\"Technology can be more immediately satisfying than the labor of building an intimate...

A) ways to draw a fascinating portrait B) how technology influences human relationships C) the dangers of accepting emotional connections D) the advantages of technology Answer:","response":"Sherry Turkle's new book, \\"Alone Together,\\" mainly discusses B) how technology influences human relationships. The book delves into the complex effects that technology has on our lives, particularly our understanding of closeness and loneliness. While technology has undoubtedly provided us with unparalleled connectivity, Turkle warns that this increased connectedness doesn't necessarily translate to deeper, more meaningful human connections. In fact, our reliance on technology might be contributing to a greater sense of loneliness than ever before. According to Turkle, one of the main concerns is the impact these superficial connections have on our personal development. With people increasingly communicating through lifeless objects and turning to their devices even when in the company of others, there is a growing confusion over what's truly important in human connections. Despite its many advantages, such as easier communication and time-saving capabilities, technology can also be extremely seductive, offering more stimulation than our natural lives. This can occasionally lead to unhealthy habits, such as watching inappropriate videos or online addiction, which detracts attention from important aspects like academic performance and the ability to form real-world relationships. Turkle's book serves as an important reminder that while technology has undoubtedly simplified and improved many aspects of our lives, it's also crucial not to let these virtual relationships supplant the development and nurturing of genuine human connections."},{"question":"Where would be a good place for a weasel to hide? - children's story - animated film - henhouse - mulberry bush - bank The best answer is Answer:","response":"A weasel, being a small and agile mammal, would have several suitable hiding places depending on its surroundings and circumstances. Each option you've mentioned presents a unique scenario or environment that could significantly influence the weasel's choice for a hiding place. Let's explore these options in detail. 1. Children's story: In the context of a children's story, the weasel would likely seek a whimsical and enchanting hiding spot that would pique the curiosity of young readers. This could be a secret burrow beneath an old oak tree, deep in a magical forest. The weasel's dwelling might be adorned with colorful mushrooms, twinkling lights, and hidden passageways, inviting children to embark on an exciting journey in search of the elusive creature. 2. Animated film: In an animated film, the possibilities for the weasel's hiding place are virtually limitless due to the creative freedom available to animators and storytellers. The weasel's hideout could be a bustling, fantastical city hidden high up in the tree canopy, complete with zip lines, trampolines, and slides that allow its agile inhabitants to navigate the landscape with ease. Alternatively, the weasel's lair could be a hidden underground society where the weasel and its companions have their world filled with dazzling crystals and rare, mystical treasures. 3. Henhouse: A weasel seeking refuge in a henhouse might be up to no good, as weasels are known for their voracious appetite for eggs and poultry. In this case, the weasel's preferred hiding place would likely be a dark, cozy corner where it can quickly scurry to avoid detection by humans or other animals. The weasel might also consider hiding in the nesting boxes or beneath straw piles, where it can keep a close watch on potential prey and stealthily plan its next move. 4. Mulberry bush: As an agile climber, a weasel would find the dense foliage of a mulberry bush to be an ideal hiding place, allowing it to stay concealed while maintaining a birds-eye view of its surroundings. The branches of the mulberry bush offer ample cover for the weasel, as well as comfortable spots to rest and groom itself. The nutritious mulberries could also provide a convenient food source for the weasel, which primarily enjoys a diet of insects, birds, and small mammals but is also known to eat fruit on occasion. 5. Bank: If our weasel friend were to find itself in a bank, its ideal hiding place would likely be out of sight from humans and security cameras, such as in the ventilation system or hidden amongst storage boxes in the secure vault area. The weasel may even opt to utilize its natural skills of agility and cunning to navigate behind the scenes, becoming the bank's unlikely mascot and secretly aiding in identifying weak security measures or uncovering fraud. In conclusion, the best hiding place for a weasel would greatly depend on its environment, its goals, and the context in which it finds itself. Be it a whimsical children's story or an unconventional adventure at the bank, the weasel's agility, cunning, and adaptability ensure that it can find a suitable shelter in virtually any setting."},{"question":"Babylonia (gastropod) - Babylonia is a genus of sea snails marine gastropod mollusks in the family Babyloniidae.

Early Monday morning in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn, Officers Peter J. Figoski and Glenn Estrada were responding to a robbery in a two-story home on Pine Street. When shots rang out, Officer Estrada left the man with whom he was struggling to chase down the suspected gunman, Lamont Pride, 27, who the police said had shot Officer Figoski in the face. Officer Figoski, 47, died five hours later of his wounds at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, but his colleagues lauded him for helping others even in death — his organs were to be donated. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said on Tuesday that detectives had apprehended Kevin Santos, 30, who he said participated in the break-in with Mr. Pride and struggled with Officer Estrada. Mr. Santos was captured at his girlfriend’s house in Ozone Park, Queens, said Mr. Kelly, by detectives who initially only had his street name – Luck – to work with. “With the help of the real-time-crime center, they established that Santos had used his girlfriend’s address in a car accident report,” Mr. Kelly told reporters. “Detectives drove to his house and found him there.” Mr. Kelly said that two other men who had initially posed as good Samaritans, and even gave officers descriptions of Mr. Pride and Mr. Santos and the guns they saw, were now being charged as part of a five-person crime team. The two men were identified by the police as Ariel Tejada, 22, and Nelson Moralez, 27. Mr. Tejada and Mr. Morales were initially “treated as witnesses,” said Mr. Kellly, and were never let go by the police after the episode. They were arrested after their stories started to unravel, and “as their participation in the crimes emerged,” Mr. Kelly said. The fifth suspect, Michael Velez, 21, the police said, was supposed to be the driver of a getaway car. Detectives tracked him down at 8:30 p.m. on Monday at a cousin’s house in Brooklyn, Mr. Kelly said. Investigators believe Mr. Velez – who was seen on surveillance film walking away quickly from the crime scene – had parked a gold Nissan Maxima at a fire hydrant on Pine Street, but that it was penned in by the police response to Officer Figoski’s shooting. “It wasn’t a good plan,” said Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman. “He couldn’t get away.” As part of their plan, Mr. Kelly said, the men met at an apartment in Queens, at about 1 a.m. on Monday, and planned to rob the tenant in the basement of 25 Pine Street, who they believed was a marijuana dealer. The five suspects – all of whom except Mr. Tejada had a history of arrests – were being held at the 75th Precinct station house in East New York, where Officer Figoski worked for 22 years, the police said. Mr. Lamont was facing first-degree murder, and other charges, the police said. Each of the four other men was charged with second-degree murder, along with other charges, the police said. Mr. Kelly said no one else was being sought in connection with Officer Figoski’s killing. “I hope that the swift apprehension of these suspects gives some measure of relief to the family of Officer Figoski,” said Mr. Kelly, who mentioned that a scholarship fund had been started for his four daughters. “Officer Figoski spent his entire professional life assisting the residents of one of the poorest places in New York City.” Mr. Kelly also recounted some of the radio transmissions made by Officer Estrada as he chased down the man who he believed had shot his partner, showing what he called “remarkable, disciplined calm,” and precise descriptions of the suspect and the direction he was running. The officer went south on Pine Street, and radioed that in. He said the man was possibly armed. He then said he was headed south on Euclid Avenue, toward Fulton Street. “The dispatcher inquires, \`You have him or not?’” said Mr. Kelly, reading the record himself with clipped authority. “Officer Estrada replies, \`Right behind him.’” Within moments, Mr. Pride was lying prone on the sidewalk as Officer Estrada handcuffed him, Mr. Kelly said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article covers the investigation and subsequent arrests made in connection with a Brooklyn robbery that led to the killing of a veteran police officer, Peter J.

The rain is pouring outside, and the aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. Terry looks excitedly at Danielle, who appears slightly apprehensive.) Terry: Danielle, I just finished reading your epic fantasy short story, \\"The Enchanted Forest\\"! I absolutely loved it - your creativity, world-building, and character development blew me away! Danielle: (smiling nervously) Thank you so much, Terry! I'm glad you enjoyed it. I was nervous to share it with you, since I know how much you love the fantasy genre. Terry: Well, your nervousness was unwarranted. There were so many amazing aspects! I especially loved the magical creatures you created, like the Arcane Wolves and the Whispering Wisps - they were so unique and added so much depth to your story. Danielle: (blushing) Thanks!

It took some time to develop them, but I'm happy with the results. Terry: Your hard work definitely paid off! Another aspect I loved about your story was the intricacy of the plot. The quest to find the Enchanted Forest's hidden treasure, while also dealing with the protagonist's internal struggle, really made the narrative captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat. Danielle: I'm really glad you connected with the story and its characters. I wanted to give the protagonist a relatable and emotional journey, besides just a physical quest to find the treasure.

I've seldom encountered such a strong and independent female character in a fantasy story. She defied so many stereotypes and felt so real to me. Danielle: It was important for me to create a female character that could stand on her own. I purposefully stayed away from the \\"damsel in distress\\" trope and wanted to make Lira a role model for empowerment.

Can you tell me more about the inspiration behind the setting? Danielle: Of course! I've always been captivated by the idea of an enchanted forest - a place full of mystery, magic, and hidden dangers. I wanted this story to transport the reader to an entirely new world, one that they could explore and get lost in. So I drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including my own experiences in nature and my love of mythology and folklore. Terry: Well, you definitely succeeded in creating a captivating world. Honestly, Danielle, I could go on and on about your story - it's really that good! Are you planning to continue this storyline or create more stories set in this universe? I'd love to read more about Lira and the Enchanted Forest. Danielle: (smiling) I'm really touched by your enthusiasm, Terry. I'm definitely considering expanding on this storyline and delving deeper into the characters and world that I've created. Your feedback truly means a lot to me and only encourages me to keep writing. Terry: I'm so happy to hear that, Danielle! You have such a talent for writing, and I look forward to seeing more of your work.

Plot title: Havoc Movie plot: The film begins in a parking lot in which a teenage filmmaker named Eric is attempting to document the faux-gangsta lifestyle enjoyed by Allison Lang and her boyfriend Toby's gang of white upper-class teenagers living in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend. The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust.

Options: - happiness - blank stares - communication - getting arrested - stage fright The answer is \\"getting arrested\\" because The answer is:","response":"\\"Getting arrested\\" because expressing yourself in public without wearing pants is considered a violation of public decency laws in most jurisdictions. Public decency laws are in place to maintain a certain level of decorum and order so that everyone in society can feel safe and comfortable. Engaging in behavior that goes against these norms, such as appearing in public without pants, can lead to uncomfortable and even dangerous situations. Here's a breakdown of why each of the other options is not the correct answer: - Happiness: While some individuals might enjoy the thrill of breaking norms or acting in a deviant manner, expressing oneself in public without wearing pants is unlikely to result in happiness for the majority of people. Most individuals find such behavior awkward, embarrassing, and disrespectful to others, which could lead to feelings of guilt or remorse. Additionally, the potential legal consequences could overshadow any fleeting moments of happiness experienced by the offender. - Blank stares: Although some people might be too shocked or confused to react contextually in this situation, the most likely response from the majority of people would be one of disapproval, fear, or anger. The sight of someone without pants in public could make others feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and anxious. Therefore, blank stares may not be a typical reaction in this scenario. - Communication: While appearing in public without pants could be seen as a form of nonverbal communication, it is not an effective or appropriate means of conveying a message. Expressing oneself through clothing or lack thereof is generally considered unconventional, and it can be easily misconstrued. Furthermore, most people would not view such an act as a valid form of communication and might even take offense. - Stage fright: Stage fright is the experience of anxiety or fear when faced with a performance or presentation in front of an audience. Though it is possible that someone might experience stage fright in a situation where they are not wearing pants in public, choosing to express oneself in this manner is actually a conscious decision that would likely exacerbate the anxiety. Also, stage fright is not specific to the act of appearing in public without pants, so it is not the correct answer. In conclusion, expressing yourself in public without wearing pants will most likely result in getting arrested because it is a violation of public decency laws. Such behavior is inconsistent with the norms of society, making it potentially harmful to others' sense of comfort and safety. While the other options provided might be plausible to some extent, they do not adequately represent the primary consequences that would typically arise from this act."},{"question":"What is the last name of the painter Scarpia mistrusts and believes complicit in Angelotti's escape? Answer the above question based on the context below: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: \\"Qual'occhio al mondo\\" (\\"What eyes in the world\\"). After Tosca has left, Angelotti reappears and discusses with the painter his plan to flee disguised as a woman, using... A:","response":"Based on the given context, the last name of the painter Scarpia mistrusts and believes complicit in Angelotti's escape is Cavaradossi.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat.

And in recent decades, their fortunes have shifted with long-term changes in the annual ice conditions on which they depend, with eight... ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Largest population of penguins found in Antarctic Peninsula Scientists have stumbled across a huge group of previously unknown Adélie penguins on the most northerly point of the Antarctic Peninsula. Numbering more than 1.5 million birds, they were first noticed when great patches of their poo, or guano, showed up in pictures taken from space. The animals are crammed on to a rocky archipelago called the Danger Islands. The researchers, who detail the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports, say it is a total surprise. \\"It's a classic case of finding something where no-one really looked! The Danger Islands are hard to reach, so people didn't really try that hard,\\" team-member Dr Tom Hart from Oxford University, UK, told BBC News. Image copyright T.S.McChord/H.Singh/NU/WHOI Image caption Drone pictures were one of the most efficient means of counting The scientists used an algorithm to search images from the American Landsat spacecraft for sites of possible penguin activity. Landsat does not return especially high-resolution pictures and so when the system flagged potential colonies, they had to be followed up with much sharper pictures for confirmation. \\"And the sheer size of what we were looking at took our breath away,\\" said Dr Heather Lynch from Stony Brook University, New York. \\"We thought, 'Wow! If what we're seeing is true, these are going to be some of the largest Adélie penguin colonies in the world, and it's going to be well worth our while sending in an expedition to count them properly.\\" You may also be interested in: Image copyright C.Youngflesh/SBU Image caption The drones flew grid lines over the penguin nests But, as the name implies, the Danger Islands are notoriously difficult to reach. Even in the austral summer, the ocean surrounding the archipelago is filled with the kind of thick sea-ice that ships try to avoid. However, in December 2015, the team did manage to get on the ground to begin its count. And one of the most effective techniques was to deploy drones, which flew above the birds to make large mosaics of their nesting sites. \\"The drone lets you fly in a grid over the island, taking pictures once per second. You can then stitch them together into a huge collage that shows the entire landmass in 2D and 3D,\\" explained Prof Hanumant Singh from Northeastern University. Image copyright T.HART/OXFORD Image caption These are dangerous waters - hence the name of the islands Once again, trained software was called upon to do the actual counting. The survey revealed that the Danger Islands host in total 751,527 pairs of Adélie penguins, including the third and fourth largest colonies in the world. The result is of major significance because it would appear the archipelago has somehow avoided the recent Adélie declines documented elsewhere on the peninsula, particularly on its western side. Scientists suspect that decline has something to do with reductions in sea-ice, which is an important habitat for krill, the small crustaceans that form a key part of the penguin diet. Image copyright R.Herman/LSU/SBU Image caption Sea-ice is important to these birds because it is a recruitment habitat for krill Dr Hart commented: \\"On the West Antarctic Peninsula, Adelie and chinstrap penguins are declining pretty fast, while Gentoo penguins are increasing. \\"It's hard to know the causes. Clearly climate change and reduction in ice and krill play a part, but a decline in sea-ice also allows in shipping - fisheries in particular - which may exacerbate the problem. \\"In the past we've looked at this on the West Antarctic Peninsula versus places like Elephant Island (further to the north). Finally getting into the Danger Islands and counting the penguins shows how robust populations are where the ice is intact.\\" And Dr Lynch added: \\"The other point worth making is that these islands are right in the mix for a couple of marine protected areas that are being proposed. \\"Whether they'll be in or out, we don't know but at least now the people making those decisions will understand how important this area is,\\" she told BBC News. Dr Peter Fretwell from the British Antarctic Survey knows the team but was not involved in this study. He also uses satellites to identify and count animal groups. \\"Despite our modern technologically advanced world there are still remote corners that we know very little about - usually because they are extremely difficult to get to,\\" he said. \\"Modern satellites are fantastic tools for exploring and studying these hard-to-access places.

The birds, whose numbers have been falling due to weather changes and reduced food supplies, were discovered when satellite images showed patches of their excrement.

Step 2: Analyze the heat exposure in each scenario Next, we evaluate the heat exposure for each scenario. a) Roaring bonfire: A bonfire typically has a high heat output and strong flames, quickly transferring large amounts of heat to objects in contact with it. b) Warm oven for an hour: An oven set at a warm temperature (e.g., around 180°F or 82°C) transfers heat more gradually, allowing the potato to heat evenly over the given time. Step 3: Evaluate the effects of heat transfer on the potatoes With the information in the prompt and the heat exposure analysis, we can assume the following: a) In the roaring bonfire, the potato experiences a rapid transfer of heat. According to the statement \\"if too much heat is transferred to an object then that object may burn,\\" the potato will likely burn. b) In the warm oven, the potato experiences a slower, more controlled transfer of heat. This setting is less likely to result in burning, and the potato will more likely cook evenly. Step 4: Form a comparative statement between the two scenarios Now, we bring our analysis together and make a comparative statement: \\"A potato that is placed in a roaring bonfire, when compared to a potato left in a warm oven for an hour, will be more likely to burn due to the rapid transfer of heat.\\""},{"question":"Given the question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Awesome!

Let's call the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A \\"t\\". In this time, Train A has traveled for (t + 2) hours, since it left the station 2 hours earlier. Train A's distance: (30 mph) * (t + 2) hours Train B's distance: (36 mph) * t hours Since Train B catches up to Train A, their distances will be equal: (30 mph) * (t + 2) = (36 mph) * t To solve this equation, follow these steps: 1. Distribute the 30 mph on the left side of the equation: 30t + 60 = 36t 2. Rearrange the equation to have all terms with \\"t\\" on one side and constants on the other: 30t - 36t = -60 3. Combine the terms with \\"t\\" and simplify the equation: -6t = -60 4. Divide both sides by -6: t = 10 Now that we know it takes 10 hours for Train B to catch up to Train A, we can calculate the distance at which they meet by plugging the value of t into either equation.

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress.

I’m usually quite happy to do the driving and let Craig have the drinks. I love driving my electric car.

Article: Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury led her to t'ai chi when Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the mysterious Chinese sport.\\"I was active and could not bear resting in bed and I thought I had to find some way to recover,\\"she recalls. She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\\"nice, patient instructor--Nelson\\", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\\"family\\"-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:\\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground. Then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine. His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but should endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\\" Following the master, Oliver now learns to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning , makes kung fu tea for guests and draws ink-wash bamboo paintings. She spends her time outside t'ai chi attending cultural exchange events. Question: Why did Oliver decide to try t'ai chi? Options: A: She couldn't join in other active sports. B: She had no other choice. C: She wanted to continue her dream. D: She wanted to recover. Answer:","response":"D: She wanted to recover. Oliver decided to try t'ai chi because she was active and could not bear resting in bed due to her back injury, and she thought that she needed to find some way to recover.

Sentence 2: I raced him to the car, but he was there first, so he got to ride shotgun. Does race mean the same thing in these two sentences?","response":"In both sentences, the term \\"race\\" refers to a competitive activity involving speed or reaching a destination in the shortest possible time. However, there are subtle contextual differences between the two sentences which alter the usage and exact meaning of \\"race\\" in each situation. In Sentence 1, \\"Let's race and see who gets there first,\\" the word \\"race\\" is used to propose a challenge or a contest between two or more participants. The context suggests that the speaker is inviting the listener to compete with them in reaching a particular destination before the other(s). The primary focus is on the competition and the act of outpacing each other. In this instance, \\"race\\" refers specifically to the competition and the challenge proposed by the speaker. In Sentence 2, \\"I raced him to the car, but he was there first, so he got to ride shotgun,\\" the word \\"race\\" describes the actual action of the speaker trying to outpace or outrun their opponent to reach a specific location, in this case, the car. This sentence is recounting the experience of competing against someone, in which the speaker loses, and consequently, the opponent is granted the privilege of riding in the front passenger seat (shotgun). In this context, \\"race\\" is not only about the competition but also about the experience and outcome. The speaker's use of \\"race\\" in this sentence expresses the act of running or moving quickly in comparison to the other person while highlighting the competitive nature of the action as well. In summary, while \\"race\\" conveys the idea of competition based on speed or rapidly reaching a destination in both sentences, the term is used slightly differently in each instance. In Sentence 1, \\"race\\" primarily refers to the challenge or invitation to compete, while in Sentence 2, it highlights the speaker's competitive actions, experience, and outcome in the contest."},{"question":"Information: - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

Rumors started swirling that Julian Assange had died, a \\"dead man's switch\\" had been triggered, and all remaining WikiLeaks documents would be released as a result, Gizmodo reports. But a WikiLeaks volunteer has since assured the world Assange is still alive (he also tweeted pictures of them together on Monday.) WikiLeaks explained on Twitter Sunday night, \\"Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party. We have activated the appropriate contingency plans.\\" As CNET reports, Assange's name and the hashtag #FreeJulian have been trending on Twitter, with some speculating that the US is responsible for severing Assange's internet connection. Time rounds up the rumors flying around the weird tweets, including one that involves Pamela Anderson. As the AP reports, Anderson visited Assange over the weekend at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he's holed up; she brought him a vegan meal, and some are theorizing (presumably jokingly) that perhaps the meal killed him. In regard to those 64-character codes, Gizmodo explains what a \\"pre-commitment\\" actually is: \\"a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with,\\" writes Bryan Menegus. \\"Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes.\\"","response":"Title: The Mystery Behind WikiLeaks' Odd Twitter Messages and Julian Assange's Status On Sunday, the WikiLeaks Twitter account posted a series of cryptic messages which included the phrases \\"pre-commitment 1: John Kerry,\\" \\"pre-commitment 2: Ecuador,\\" and \\"pre-commitment 3: UK FCO\\" (United Kingdom's Foreign Commonwealth Office). Each phrase was followed by a 64-character string of letters and numbers. These peculiar messages sparked rumors that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, had died and triggered a \\"dead man's switch,\\" which would release all remaining unpublished documents as a consequence. However, a WikiLeaks volunteer soon tweeted photos proving Assange was still alive, and WikiLeaks clarified via Twitter that Assange's internet link had been intentionally cut by an unidentified state actor. They also stated they had activated appropriate contingency plans. As a result, Assange's name and the hashtag #FreeJulian started trending on Twitter, with many users speculating that the United States might be responsible for severing Assange's internet connection. The recent rumors included Pamela Anderson's involvement. The actress visited Assange over the weekend at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he remains in refuge. She brought him a vegan meal, which led some to jokingly theorize that perhaps the meal was the cause of the alleged death. Gizmodo provided an explanation for the mysterious 64-character codes in the tweets, identifying them as \\"pre-commitments,\\" which are part of a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. This means that these unique codes serve as proof that the content of the documents remains unaltered – changing the leaks would also change those 64-character codes. With Assange's well-being verified and the purpose of the pre-commitment codes explained, it appears that the rumors and conspiracy theories have been debunked. However, questions remain regarding who severed Assange's internet connection and why, as well as what WikiLeaks' contingency plans entail."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who gets a blast of electricity from Black Adam? Movie plot title: Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam Movie plot: The film opens with a young couple sitting in their car on a hillside outside of the city as an apparent meteor streaks across the sky and smashes into the couple's car. It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to meet with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees some bullies mugging a homeless man. After attempting to defend the man, Billy himself receives a black eye. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, calling him \\"The Captain\\". Billy tells him that he always tries to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only thing of value he has â a subway token. At the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfasts, and tells him he wants to write a story to bring his plight, and those in his same situation, to public light. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering outside the diner. He claps his hands together, blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and quickly changes into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy does not know what he means.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we consider the complexities of human behavior, thoughts, and emotions, it's clear that each individual is unique and may exhibit varying reactions in similar situations. Factors such as culture, personal experiences, and environment can heavily influence one's emotional response and outward expressions. Take, for example, an individual who appears to be frowning or displaying a furrowed brow — these expressions could be interpreted as anger, frustration, or concentration depending on the specific context or the individual. Similarly, some cultures may consider it impolite to exhibit overtly emotional expressions, thereby making it challenging to discern their thoughts or emotions based solely on their facial expressions or body language. Additionally, some people may be exceptionally skilled in masking their emotions or deliberately misleading others with their nonverbal cues. This further illustrates the difficulty in making accurate assessments about someone's emotions or thoughts without direct communication. In conclusion, while facial expressions and body language can indeed provide insights into an individual's emotions, it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty what someone is thinking or feeling based solely on these cues. Personal and cultural factors, as well as the individual's ability to control or manipulate their outward expressions, create too much room for interpretation and risk of misjudgment."},{"question":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave.

A ruler is also incorrect for the same reason as a tape measure; it is an instrument for measuring length and not suitable for detecting seismic activity. (4). A Geiger counter is incorrect because it is a device used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation, such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.

A:","response":"A: Long distances Justification of the answer: The passage states that the energy is diluted as an electromagnetic wave travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an ever-larger area.

The three young girls live as sisters, but the more rambunctious Ivy is bored by their childish games of tea and rejoices at Ivan's unexpected early day return from the office, saying, \\"There's going to be fireworks.\\" Ivy's prediction soon comes true. Ivan catches Rebecca in bed with the handsome pool boy, and the two men scuffle. As Ivan tends to his wounds, he and Rebecca begin a loud argument about their adulterous affair. The shouting brings Catherine's attention from the garden. Upon learning of the affair, she immediately evicts Rebecca and her children. In 1996, Violet returns to the Greer home and is reunited with Joy for the first time in eleven years. Violet states that she is looking for a summer time residence while working as a waitress at Denny's Restaurants and planning to attend the local junior college. Joy suggests that she reside with them and stay in the late Catherine's room. Joy is an amateur tennis star and engaged to her boyfriend from Princeton University, Michael, who will be working as an intern for Joy's father's bank. During a late night party, Violet feels isolated and ridiculed by Joy's Ivy League friends, and excuses herself for late shift work.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","response":"Statisticile sugerează că Serbia reciclează de aproape zece ori mai puțin deșeu decât statele membre ale UE, dar oficialii spun că reciclarea este în creștere. În ultimii ani, Serbia s-a confruntat cu provocări majore în ceea ce privește gestionarea deșeurilor și implementarea unor politici de reciclare eficiente. În comparație cu statele membre ale Uniunii Europene, Serbia reciclează de zece ori mai puțin deșeu, dar tendințele actuale par să se îmbunătățească într-un ritm constant. Guvernul sârb a lansat mai multe inițiative pentru a încuraja populația să recicleze și pentru a dezvolta infrastructura necesară acestui proces. De exemplu, în anul 2019, Serbia și-a propus să crească gradul de reciclare a deșeurilor în următorii zece ani, stabilind un obiectiv de creștere a reciclării de la aproximativ 15% în prezent, la cel puțin 50% până în 2030. Autoritățile locale au luat, de asemenea, măsuri pentru a spori conștientizarea publicului în legătură cu importanța reciclării și a protejării mediului înconjurător. Campanii de informare și de educare a populației au fost organizate în întreaga țară, promovând colectarea selectivă a deșeurilor și gestionarea responsabilă a resurselor. Deși progresele sunt evidente, Serbia mai are de depășit numeroase obstacole în drumul său spre implementarea unui sistem de reciclare eficient. Printre acestea se numără și lipsa de fonduri suficiente, o infrastructură subdezvoltată și o cultură a reciclării în populație care încă nu este pe deplin implementată. Cu toate acestea, oficialii sârbi se arată optimiști în ceea ce privește viitorul reciclării în țara lor și sunt determinați să colaboreze cu partenerii europeni pentru a atinge obiectivele stabilite. În concluzie, este clar că Serbia se confruntă în prezent cu provocări semnificative în contextul reciclării deșeurilor, însă este pe drumul cel bun pentru a-și îmbunătăți performanțele și a se alinia la normele europene. Cu sprijinul autorităților și implicarea cetățenilor, este posibil ca Serbia să-și atingă și chiar să depășească obiectivele stabilite în ceea ce privește reciclarea și să devină un exemplu pozitiv în regiunea Balcanilor."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

New Year's Eve attacks on women in Cologne, blamed on migrants, have put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel. Most of those sent back to Austria are not Syrians, who usually get asylum. Instead, they are migrants mostly from Afghanistan as well as Morocco and Algeria, Austrian police said. \\"The daily number of migrants being turned back has risen from 60 in December to 200 since the start of the year,\\" David Furtner, police spokesman in Upper Austria state, told AFP news agency. Last week, Sweden, a favoured destination for many of the migrants, sought to stem the flow by imposing controls on travellers from Denmark. Earlier, an official report said the men suspected of attacking women in central Cologne on New Year's Eve were \\"almost exclusively\\" from a migration background, mainly North African and Arab. Nineteen individuals are currently under investigation by the state police in connection with the attacks, NRW's interior ministry says in a report (in German), none of them German nationals. Those 19 suspects include 14 men from Morocco and Algeria. Ten of the suspects are asylum seekers, nine of whom arrived in Germany after September 2015. The other nine are possibly in Germany illegally, the interior ministry says. Cologne police also made \\"serious mistakes\\" in not calling in reinforcements and the way they informed the public. The scale of the assaults on women in Cologne and other German cities has shocked Germany. More than 500 criminal complaints were filed, 40% alleging sexual assault.

What age group was the largest?","response":"Based on the information provided in the article, the age distribution in the city is as follows: 1. 24.2% of residents were under the age of 18 2. 8.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24 3. 24.7% were from 25 to 44 4. 28.4% were from 45 to 64 5. 14.6% were 65 years of age or older Upon evaluating these percentages, it is evident that the largest age group in the city is the one consisting of residents between the ages of 45 to 64, as it comprises 28.4% of the total population. To provide a more comprehensive perspective, it is relevant to understand the median age as well. The article mentions that the median age in the city is 39.4 years. This value represents the midpoint of the age distribution - meaning that half of the residents are younger than 39.4 years, and the other half is older. The median age provides insight into the overall age distribution and confirms that the city's population leans towards an older demographic, which is in line with the largest age group being 45 to 64 years old. Additionally, the gender makeup in the city is stated to be 49.0% male and 51.0% female, suggesting a slightly higher proportion of females in the population. However, it's important to note that this gender distribution does not have a direct impact on determining the largest age group in the city. In conclusion, the largest age group in the city is constituted by residents between 45 to 64 years old, accounting for 28.4% of the population. This is further supported by the median age of 39.4 years, indicating that a significant portion of the population is middle-aged or older."},{"question":"What key details about antulio segarra can be extracted from the following bio?

These hormones play a crucial role in regulating metabolic processes in the body. Step 2: Analyze the question The posed question is \\"what increases the rate of metabolism in cells?\\". The user is not directly asking for the cause of the increase in metabolism in the context of Graves disease.

However, it's important to consider other factors or substances that can also increase the rate of metabolism. Step 4: Evaluate the proposed answer The proposed answer \\"heat energy\\" is not incorrect, as raised temperatures can indeed result in faster metabolic processes. This is because chemical reactions typically become faster when heat is increased, and metabolism relies on chemical reactions within cells. However, this answer doesn't consider the context provided.

Answer: it is not possible to tell"},{"question":"Add spaces: Themostimportantpartofanygoodgraphicaluserinterfaceisiconicgraphics.","response":"The most important part of any good graphical user interface is iconic graphics. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have become a vital aspect of modern software design, as they provide users with an intuitive and visually appealing way to interact with applications on a wide range of devices. Iconic graphics are a crucial component of these interfaces, as they help users quickly identify and understand the functions and features of an application. There are several reasons why iconic graphics are essential for a successful GUI: 1. Intuitive representation: Iconic graphics visually represent the purpose or functionality of a UI element, making it easier for users to understand and use. For example, a trash bin icon clearly communicates the function of deleting an object, while a magnifying glass icon signifies search functionality. This way, even users who are not familiar with a specific application can quickly grasp its basic functions. 2. Aesthetic value: UI design that includes iconic graphics is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. This visual appeal is important, as it encourages users to engage with the software and can even contribute to a positive experience using the application. 3. Efficiency: Iconic graphics contribute to a more efficient GUI, as they help users quickly find and execute specific functions. This is particularly important in applications featuring a large number of tools and options, as it can be overwhelming for users to navigate through large menus or lists. 4. Cross-cultural and cross-platform communication: Iconic graphics can transcend language and cultural barriers, providing a universally understood representation of certain concepts. This is particularly helpful for software that targets international audiences or is used on diverse platforms and devices, as users can easily recognize icons regardless of their linguistic or cultural backgrounds. 5. Accessibility: Designing a user interface that incorporates iconic graphics can improve the accessibility of an application for users with certain disabilities or impairments. For example, relying on visual representations can enhance the experience for users with cognitive or learning impairments by making it easier for them to identify and understand functions. To ensure the effectiveness of iconic graphics in a GUI, designers should adhere to certain best practices: 1. Use consistent and coherent design principles: Establishing a consistent visual style for the entire interface, including icons, can enhance the overall user experience. This includes choosing a suitable color scheme, using a consistent iconography style, and providing a uniform look and feel throughout the application. 2. Opt for simplicity: Icons should be easy to understand and visually simple. Overly complex or intricate icons can confuse and overwhelm users. Additionally, simpler designs typically scale better, making them easier to recognize on devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions. 3. Consider context: The placement, size, and overall context of icons within the interface can have a significant impact on their effectiveness. For example, ensuring that icons are placed near the corresponding UI elements or grouped in logical ways can make them more meaningful to users. 4. Test with users: Usability testing is an essential step in evaluating the effectiveness of iconic graphics in a GUI. Soliciting feedback from users can help identify potential issues with icon design or placement, ensuring that the user interface is optimized for usability and understandability. In conclusion, iconic graphics play a fundamental role in designing good graphical user interfaces. These visuals not only enhance the overall user experience but also contribute to an application's efficiency and accessibility. By adhering to best practices and constantly striving for improvement, designers can create appealing and highly functional GUIs that cater to a diverse range of users."},{"question":"Given the question: The other day an acquaintance of mine, an outgoing and charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly alone in New York for an hour or two between appointments. He went to the Whitney and spent the \\"empty\\" time looking at things in solitary happiness. For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone. What had he been afraid of, I asked myself? That, suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But having taken a decisive step, he is now on the edge of adventure; he is about to be launched into his own inner space to the astronaut. His every perception will come to him with a new freshness and, for a time, seem surprisingly original. For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another human being present, vision becomes double vision, unavoidably. We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact gets lost. \\"Music I heard with you was more than music.\\" Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience. \\"Alone one is never lonely: the spirit adventures, walking in a quiet garden, in a cool house, staying single there.\\" Loneliness is very strongly felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences of taste, temperament and mood. Human intercourse often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel ly. That is a great luxury!

The writer talks about their acquaintance's experience of solitary happiness and the changes it brought to his perspective. Step 2: Examine the options given and the author's tone and intent Option A proposes a persuading tone aimed at encouraging people to live alone, but the passage is more about sharing personal insights on solitude rather than persuading. Option B focuses on teaching a specific group, i.e., the young in modern society, but the passage doesn't target a particular age group. Option C suggests the author is promoting a simple way of living, but that's not the central idea being discussed.

Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

Owing to the success of the buffalo runners, the winter passed away in comparative comfort. But, as we have said, some of the settlers who had been ruined by the failure of the fisheries and the depredations of the mice, and who did not share much in the profits of the autumn hunt, were obliged once again to seek their old port of refuge at Pembina. Among these was the Swiss family Morel. Andre went, because he did not wish to remain comparatively idle in the colony during the long months of winter. Elise went for the purpose of keeping house--perhaps we should say keeping hut--for Andre. Fred Jenkins went because he wanted to learn more about Indian ways and customs, as well as to perfect himself in the art of hunting the buffalo--that was all!

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Context: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid. Shad has even more bones than other fish and you'll never see it featured on any cooking show (except maybe Iron Chef, where the disgusting and unusual seems to be standard). It took me all day to thaw out the fish in the lounge sink?#8364;?an activity which elicited howls of complaint from the guys trying to watch TV.

A lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously. Show People is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. The movie captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary. Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It is a fast paced, interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars.

Second question: What is it like to have deep psychosis? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"To answer your questions, I will first provide you with a better understanding of the concepts mentioned, and then individually address each question. Stigmata are wounds that, in some religious belief systems, are believed to appear on the body in the same locations as those suffered by Jesus Christ during crucifixion. The causes and interpretations of stigmata vary. Deep spirituality is a term used to describe a strong connection to religious or spiritual beliefs, often accompanied by a sense of unity with a higher power or the divine. Advanced psychosis refers to a severe mental disorder in which a person experiences a loss of contact with reality, often manifesting as hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking. Self-harm is the act of intentionally injuring oneself, usually as a means of coping with emotional pain or distress. Now, let me address your questions: 1. Stigmata's interpretation depends on one's belief system and context. It could be seen as a sign of deep spirituality if someone believes the stigmata are a divine manifestation. On the other hand, if someone associates stigmata with advanced psychosis, they might interpret it as a result of losing touch with reality. In some cases, self-harm might be a plausible explanation if an individual causes these wounds intentionally. As an AI, I don't hold personal opinions, so I can't tell you which interpretation is correct. However, it is possible that these phenomena have different explanations in different cases. 2. Experiencing advanced psychosis can vary from one person to another, as the symptoms can manifest differently. However, it typically involves severe disruption of thoughts and emotions, hallucinations, false beliefs, disorientation, and difficulty functioning in daily life. People with advanced psychosis may feel distress, confusion, fear, and, in some cases, detachment from reality. To answer your last question, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is asking for the interpretation of stigmata and how it could be related to spirituality, psychosis, or self-harm. The second question is asking about the experience of having advanced psychosis. While there might be some overlap in these topics, they are not the same question."},{"question":"Sentence: name = Loch Fyne, eatType = restaurant, food = French, familyFriendly = yes Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","response":"Sure!

A: Choices: a). lungs. b). liver. c). spleen. d). kidneys. Answer:","response":"Answer: d). kidneys. Dialysis is a medical treatment that essentially serves as an artificial alternative to the kidneys when they are no longer able to effectively filter waste, excess fluid, and impurities from the blood. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, is a condition where the kidneys are no longer capable of carrying out their crucial functions due to factors such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or other medical conditions that may impair the kidneys' ability to function. The primary role of the kidneys in the human body is to maintain proper balance and homeostasis of diverse essential elements such as water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. Additionally, the kidneys are responsible for the elimination of metabolites and toxins from the bloodstream and the regulation of blood pressure and the production of red blood cells by secreting hormones like erythropoietin. When a patient suffers from kidney failure, it means their kidneys are no longer capable of sufficiently performing these critical tasks, which can result in the buildup of harmful wastes and excess fluid in their body. Consequently, a patient might experience symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, difficulty breathing, swelling, abnormal heart rhythms, or even sudden death due to uremia (a toxic state caused by excessive levels of waste in the blood). Dialysis is employed as a therapeutic treatment in cases of severe kidney impairment or complete failure. There are two primary types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis is more commonly utilized and involves the patient's blood passing through a specialized filter called a dialyzer or an artificial kidney. The dialyzer removes waste products, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood, which is then returned to the patient's body. Hemodialysis typically requires three sessions per week, each lasting about four hours. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, uses the patient's abdominal lining, or peritoneum, as a natural filter. A cleansing solution called dialysate is introduced into the abdominal cavity, which absorbs waste products and excess fluids through the blood vessels of the peritoneum. The dialysate is then drained after a few hours and replaced with fresh dialysate, effectively cleansing the blood. Peritoneal dialysis allows for more flexibility and can often be performed at home, with variations like continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). While dialysis is a critical and life-sustaining treatment for many patients with kidney failure, it is essential to note that it is not a cure for the condition. In some cases, kidney function may improve and dialysis may no longer be necessary, while in others, a kidney transplant might be the most effective long-term treatment option. However, dialysis remains a critical tool in managing end-stage renal disease, prolonging the lives of countless individuals and improving their overall quality of life."},{"question":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Thumbs up for the best messaging app\\" Answer:","response":"In order to rate the review, I will consider the following factors: clarity, detail, and usefulness. 1.

And I was wondering How would Kai feel afterwards? Select from: (I). selfish; (II). remorse; (III). upset; Answer:","response":"Kai would most likely feel a combination of remorse and upset after getting caught for speeding and having to pay a big fine. This is because being caught for a violation like speeding can lead to feelings of regret and disappointment in one's actions, leading to a sense of remorse. Furthermore, the financial burden of a large fine can also cause distress and frustration, making someone feel upset about the situation. When someone commits a traffic violation like speeding, they often realize that their actions were not only illegal but also potentially dangerous. This realization can lead to a sense of remorse as they acknowledge the risks they imposed on themselves and others while speeding. Additionally, learning one's lesson often follows breaking rules which can also result in feelings of remorse. Feeling upset in this situation is also a natural response. Receiving a hefty fine can lead to financial stress and a sense of loss that might not have been anticipated. Moreover, the uncomfortable experience of dealing with law enforcement and the potential embarrassment of being caught for speeding can also contribute to feelings of upset. In summary, Kai would likely feel both remorse and upset after getting caught for speeding and paying a big fine. The feelings of remorse would stem from realizing the potential danger and understanding the need for rule abidance. The upset feelings would stem from the financial burden of the fine and the emotional burdens of interacting with law enforcement and facing potential embarrassment.

Maria acknowledged the challenge, \\"Oh, believe me, I know! That's where my cheat day comes into play. Once a week, I allow myself a designated day where I can indulge in some of my favorite treats without going overboard. It satisfies my cravings and keeps me from feeling like I'm missing out. This also helps me maintain balance and ensures that I don't view my food choices as restrictive.\\" Rebecca was impressed with Maria's discipline and dedication to her health. She realized that it wasn't just one thing that kept Maria so trim but an entire lifestyle change. It would take work, but Rebecca felt inspired by her friend's commitment and eager to start a similar journey for herself. With Maria's guidance and support, Rebecca slowly began to adopt many of the same practices that her friend had shared. Over time, she saw improvements in her own weight, energy levels, and overall health. The two friends continued to inspire one another, and as their bodies transformed, so too did their bond grow stronger, proving that the journey to a healthier self could be as much about friendship and support as it was about discipline and determination."},{"question":"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Answer:","response":"Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) is one of the most important cash crops in India, contributing significantly to the country's agricultural economy. India is the second-largest producer of sugarcane in the world, after Brazil, and the crop holds great economic value in the country. Sugarcane is primarily grown to obtain valuable products such as sugar, jaggery, molasses, ethanol, and bagasse. 1. Sugar: The main product derived from sugarcane is sugar, which is one of the staples in Indian households. Sugar is obtained by crushing the sugarcane and extracting the juice from it. This juice is then processed and crystallized to produce sugar. White sugar, brown sugar, and raw sugar are some common types of sugar produced from sugarcane. India is one of the largest consumers of sugar globally, with annual consumption exceeding 27 million metric tons. 2. Jaggery: Jaggery, or gur, is another traditional sweetener that is primarily derived from sugarcane. It holds immense cultural significance in Indian cuisine and is used in making various sweets, desserts, and beverages. Jaggery is unrefined and retains more nutrients compared to sugar. During the process of making jaggery, the extracted sugarcane juice is filtered and boiled to form a thick, sticky consistency, which is cooled and solidified. 3. Molasses: Molasses (also known as black treacle) is a viscous by-product obtained from the refining of sugarcane into sugar. Molasses is a thick, dark-colored syrup that is often used as a second-choice sweetener in various food products. It is widely used in the production of alcoholic beverages, such as rum and other distilled spirits, as well as in pharmaceuticals, confections, and animal feed. 4. Ethanol: Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is an important industrial product obtained from sugarcane. Produced by fermenting sugars found in the sugarcane juice, ethanol is used as a renewable fuel source, making it a valuable commodity in the era of climate change and depleting fossil fuel reserves. In India, ethanol production is supported by the government as a part of efforts to reduce reliance on imported petroleum products and achieve energy security. 5. Bagasse: Bagasse is the fibrous residue that remains after sugarcane stalks are crushed to extract the juice. It is a valuable by-product and used as a biofuel in the sugar industry, reducing the need for conventional energy sources. Bagasse is also utilized in the production of paper, pulp, and board, as well as in the manufacturing of eco-friendly biodegradable products such as disposable utensils and packaging materials. In conclusion, sugarcane serves as a significant cash crop in India, with various products derived from it, including sugar, jaggery, molasses, ethanol, and bagasse. The versatile and wide-ranging applications of sugarcane by-products hold crucial economic value, while also providing sustainability and renewable energy solutions."},{"question":"Data: American Journal of Mathematics EISSN_NUMBER 1080 What would a sentence about this data be like?","response":"Step 1: Identify the key information in the data. - In this case, the key information is: \\"American Journal of Mathematics\\" and \\"EISSN_NUMBER 1080\\".

After the Peace of Riga , part of the governorate became the new Woy Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic , while the other part stayed as a part of the Ukrainian SSR until 1925 . - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - The Swedish Empire refers to the Kingdom of Sweden's territorial control of much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries, a time when Sweden was one of the great European powers. The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and the end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. In Swedish history, the period is referred to as \\"stormaktstiden\\", literally meaning \\"the Great Power era\\". - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947. - The Third Partition of Poland (1795) was the last in a series of the Partitions of Poland and the land of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth among Prussia, the Austrian Empire, and the Russian Empire which effectively ended PolishLithuanian national sovereignty until 1918. Accordingly, the partitioning powers agreed to permanently erase Poland's name from existence, including from their respective encyclopaedias. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire.

Where does a group of beaver build a dam? Options: - canada - river or stream - kentucky - desert - montana If the answer is 'river or stream'; explain the reasoning:","response":"The correct answer is 'river or stream'. Reasoning: Beavers are semi-aquatic animals that build their dams on rivers and streams for multiple reasons, such as protection from predators, suitable habitat, and food accessibility. They do this by using wooden logs, stones, mud, and vegetation to create a strong barrier that obstructs the water flow. This, in turn, creates ponds or wetland areas suitable for their living conditions and providing sufficient food sources, such as trees and aquatic plants that beavers consume. Building dams in flowing water also allows beavers to reach more trees and plants located on the river banks without the need to walk vast distances on land, further reducing their vulnerability to predators. While beavers can be found in locations such as Canada, Montana, and Kentucky, their habitat is not limited to those specific places. Therefore, the answer 'river or stream' is more accurate, considering that the dam construction behavior is consistent across all beaver populations, regardless of their specific geographical location. The option 'desert' would not be accurate as beavers require water sources for their habitat, which are typically scarce in desert environments."},{"question":"To what extent is the scientific premise behind the movie Lucy valid about the possibilities of increasing our brain usage?

Is The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. a good answer to this question?","response":"The answer provided is accurate but not detailed or long enough. Here is a more comprehensive response to the question: The Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians by employing a combination of strategies which involved not only raiding the Russian supply lines but also through efficient military organization, strong leadership, and tactical maneuvers. The following are some key aspects of their efforts to slow down the Russians: 1. Raids on Russian supply lines: As suggested in the initial response, the Russian army was indeed heavily dependent on its main magazines in Poland. The Prussian army, under the leadership of King Frederick the Great, recognized this vulnerability and launched several successful raids against these supply lines. By targeting their opponent's logistical infrastructure, the Prussians were able to disrupt Russian supply chains, slow down their advance, and force the Russians to be more cautious with their movements. 2. Efficient military organization: The Prussian army was well-organized and disciplined, which was a key factor in its ability to counter the Russian threat. The Prussians had developed a system of conscription and training that produced well-trained and highly disciplined soldiers. Additionally, they had a streamlined chain of command that allowed for quick decision-making and the execution of complex strategies. 3. Leadership of Frederick the Great: One of the main reasons for the Prussian success in slowing down the Russian advance was the leadership of King Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great. Frederick was a brilliant military strategist and a strong leader, qualities that were instrumental in helping the Prussian army adapt to the challenges presented by the Russians. His ability to inspire his troops and make decisions quickly aided the Prussians in effectively executing their military plans. 4. Tactical maneuvers: The Prussians made use of their superior mobility and local knowledge of the terrain to outmaneuver the Russians in several engagements. One notable battle that exemplified this tactic was the Battle of Zorndorf. Frederick the Great chose the battleground and took advantage of the terrain, positioning his forces in such a way that the Russians found it difficult to launch a successful attack against them. The Prussians' nimble tactics and constant harassment of Russian forces slowed down the Russian advance, forcing them to fight defensively. 5. Diplomacy: In addition to military tactics, the Prussians also employed diplomatic measures to weaken the resolve of the Russian forces. The Prussians were able to cultivate alliances with other European powers, such as Great Britain and Hanover. These alliances provided the Prussians with additional military and financial support, thus strengthening their efforts to resist the Russian advance. In conclusion, the Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians through a combination of strategies that included raiding Russian supply lines, superior military organization, strong leadership, tactical maneuvers, and diplomatic efforts. These strategies, executed effectively, were crucial in helping the Prussian army counter the threat posed by the advancing Russian forces."},{"question":"Continue writing the next sentence.

These professionals are trained to diagnose and treat various mental health disorders, including dependent personality disorder. A mental health professional will work closely with the patient to determine the best course of treatment, such as individual therapy, group therapy, or a combination of both. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). One of the most commonly recommended treatments for dependent personality disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy focuses on helping the patient develop healthy thought patterns and positive coping mechanisms to deal with difficult situations and emotions. CBT can help individuals with dependent personality disorder to identify and change negative thoughts, build self-esteem, and develop a stronger sense of autonomy and independence. Explore psychodynamic therapy. Another treatment option for dependent personality disorder is psychodynamic therapy. Through this therapeutic approach, the patient will work with the therapist to explore and understand the unconscious thought processes, underlying emotions, and past experiences that may be contributing to their disorder. By gaining insight into the causes of their dependency, the patient can begin to address these issues and develop healthier ways of relating to others and forming relationships. Attend group therapy. Group therapy can be a valuable tool for those with dependent personality disorder. In a structured group setting, individuals can learn from others who may be experiencing similar challenges, develop new coping strategies, and practice essential communication and social skills. Additionally, group therapy can provide a supportive environment in which individuals can work on building self-confidence and independence. Consider medication. Although there are no specific medications designed for the treatment of dependent personality disorder, some individuals may benefit from taking medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with DPD, such as overwhelming anxiety or depression. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, as they will be able to prescribe the appropriate dosage and monitor any potential side effects. Engage in self-help activities. Besides professional treatment, individuals with dependent personality disorder can benefit from engaging in self-help activities. These can include reading self-help books, attending support groups, or engaging in mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Such activities can aid in building self-awareness and self-confidence and help foster a greater sense of independence and autonomy. Stay dedicated to recovery. Treating dependent personality disorder can be a long and challenging process. It is essential for the patient to remain committed to their treatment plan and maintain an open and honest relationship with their mental healthcare team. By actively participating in the recovery process and seeking support from loved ones, the patient can take the necessary steps to overcome the challenges associated with DPD and start living a healthier, more independent life."},{"question":"Q: Passage: The Flintstones is a 1994 American buddy comedy film directed by Brian Levant and written by Tom S.

The \\"contract\\" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"During the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring.

This in turn infects many people, robbing them of their emotions when they enter REM sleep.One of the first people infected is Tucker (Jeremy Northam), a CDC director investigating the crash. Once he is overcome, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu inoculations. In a panic from a made-up \\"flu bug,\\" people rush to get \\"inoculated,\\" later becoming pod people when they sleep that night.Tucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), knows something is amiss and, after locating several patients who say their loved ones are \\"imposters,\\" teams up with love interest and fellow doctor Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) to uncover what is really going on.With the help of Ben's friend Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), a biologist, they find out about the spore and discover that it takes over the brain during REM sleep. They also find out that people who have suffered diseases that affect the makeup of the brain, such as syphilis or ADEM, are immune to the spore because their previous diseases prevent the spore from \\"latching on\\" to the brain matter.

Cameron would be mad. And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? Choose from: * afraid that Cameron will find out; * upset about missing out on the picnic; * rejected by their friends; Answer:","response":"This situation is quite nuanced and the reactions of different parties can vary based on their relationship with Cameron and their perspective on the situation. Here, we will discuss the above-mentioned potential feelings in detail: 1. **Afraid that Cameron will find out**: This is a very likely emotion that Cameron's friends might be experiencing especially if they are close to Cameron and value their friendship with him. It is understandable that it is an uncomfortable situation and there can be fear, apprehension, and guilt. They might fear his reaction once he does find out about the picnic, especially since you mentioned that Cameron would be mad if he discovered they went on a picnic without inviting him. It's difficult to hide such things in the age of social media and it's likely that Cameron might catch wind of it from posted pictures or conversations. This fear can affect the atmosphere of the picnic as well, as individuals may be more focused on the covert nature of the event rather than enjoying it fully. 2. **Upset about missing out on the picnic**: This sentiment would likely be how Cameron may feel when he discovers that he was left out of a picnic that his friends organized. Feelings of exclusion could lead to frustration, disappointment, and a sense of being isolated or being 'left out'. The picnic might be a bonding experience that he is missing out on. Cameron's disappointment may not just stem from the missed fun experience, it could also come from a place of feeling confused or hurt as to why his friends decided to exclude him in the first place. 3. **Rejected by their friends**: Apart from being upset about missing out on the picnic, Cameron might outright feel rejected by his friends. The idea that his friends planned a gathering deliberately excluding him could lead to feelings of betrayal and rejection. This in turn could make him re-evaluate his relationship and bond with these friends and potentially create friction or conflict among the group. This sense of rejection can be quite emotionally heavy and could negatively affect Cameron's self-esteem and his trust in his friendship circle. In these scenarios, it's clear that every party involved in this situation would feel a degree of discomfort and uneasiness. The best approach might be to address the issue openly and honestly, making sure all feelings and perspectives are understood and taken into consideration. This way, they can heal any potential rifts or misunderstandings in the friendship."},{"question":"Based on the sentence \\"A man and a woman are sharing a dishwashing task in a kitchen at the sink.\\", is the sentence \\"The man and the woman are baking a cake.\\" a true sentence?","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given sentences In the given sentence, \\"A man and a woman are sharing a dishwashing task in a kitchen at the sink.\\", the focus is on dishwashing.

Sentence 2: It was a fight to the finish. Does finish mean the same thing in these two sentences?","response":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"finish\\" is used in different contexts, affecting the meaning of the word in each sentence. Although at first glance, it may seem like the word \\"finish\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, they are not exactly the same. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the differences: 1. Sentence 1: His best finish in a major tournament was third. In this sentence, the word \\"finish\\" refers to the final position or ranking achieved by an individual or a team at the end of a competition or event. This is commonly used when discussing sports or competitive activities to indicate the results. In this particular case, the context is a major tournament, and the person being discussed has achieved their best result by finishing third. Here, \\"finish\\" is a noun, denoting the final outcome or the conclusion of the individual's performance. 2. Sentence 2: It was a fight to the finish. In this sentence, the meaning of \\"finish\\" changes slightly. In this context, \\"finish\\" refers to the end or conclusion of a battle or struggle. This phrase, \\"fight to the finish,\\" is an idiom that means a fierce contest or struggle that continues until one side definitively wins or loses, with no compromise or interim resolution. The emphasis is on the intensity and persistence of the confrontation or battle, implying that the participants are determined to see things through to the end. In this case, \\"finish\\" is still a noun, but it is used to represent the point in time when the fight or struggle ends. In summary, the difference in meaning of \\"finish\\" in these two sentences lies in the nuances of the context in which the word is used. In the first sentence, \\"finish\\" pertains to positions or rankings, while in the second sentence, it refers to the end or conclusion of a struggle or battle."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity .","response":"To determine the opinion of the review, I will analyze key phrases and words, consider the overall tone, and evaluate the context in which these expressions are used.

One person is Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, who is trying to become a political leader in Miami. When she was a kid, she said that aliens took her away and still talks to her with their minds! Aliens are beings from other planets, and telepathic contact means talking without words, just by thinking. Another famous person, Billy Corgan, who plays in the band Smashing Pumpkins, told a story about meeting a shape-shifter. That's a creature that can change its appearance to look like different things. He said this happened when he was with someone and saw them transform into something that wasn't human, all while he wasn't under the influence of anything that could make him see things that weren't there. People are very curious about these stories because they involve things we can't easily explain, and the people telling them are already known for their everyday activities.

Though the first option mentions that the app may allow watching running distances in pictures, it's not the main purpose of a fitness tracker app. The focus on conserving smartphone battery is also less relevant to the main purpose of tracking running distance. 2. The third option is confusing and seems to refer to virtual matches and unrelated calculations. It doesn't give a proper explanation of how the app helps track running distance. 3.

It is an idiomatic expression that implies that something has lost its novelty or appeal over time or has become increasingly less enjoyable or interesting. In the context of a movie review, it suggests that the film fails to hold the audience's attention or maintain their interest throughout its duration. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a weak storyline, repetitive action sequences, or underdeveloped characters. Consequently, the viewers might feel a sense of frustration or disappointment with the movie, as their initial enthusiasm and anticipation gradually fade away. Additionally, the phrase \\"wears thin\\" might be indicative of a broader pattern that the reviewer has noticed in the movie industry. The proliferation of sequels, remakes, and adaptations might contribute to the overall impression that many movies are lacking in originality and creativity. As a result, even the most captivating themes or engaging storylines may begin to lose their appeal, as audiences have already been exposed to similar content in the past. Conversely, the phrase \\"wears thin\\" might be used by a reviewer to emphasize specific shortcomings in the film's production or content, rather than to offer a general critique of the movie industry. For instance, the reviewer might believe that a movie with a strong premise failed to live up to its potential due to poor execution, such as subpar acting, weak dialogues, or heavy-handed direction. In any case, the phrase \\"wears thin\\" in a movie review is likely to convey a sense of disappointment on the part of the reviewer, and it can be regarded as a negative assessment of the film in question."},{"question":"Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which Library is located near The Henry Ford and the Glass House in Michigan?

A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings and hills before snowcapped mountains.A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael. Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet, while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards as if in prayer, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green houppelande, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court. The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur. The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the Arnolfini Portrait.The capital of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier van der Paele and Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer. Elisabeth Dhanens speculates that they might depict the sarcophagus of Hippolytus in Pisa, which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander.

Premise: \\"A man either giving or viewing a powerpoint presentation.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man is near a screen.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Understanding the Premise The premise states: \\"A man either giving or viewing a PowerPoint presentation.\\" This implies that there are two possible scenarios: Scenario 1: The man is giving a PowerPoint presentation. Scenario 2: The man is viewing a PowerPoint presentation. Step 2: Relating the Premise to the Hypothesis The hypothesis is: \\"A man is near a screen.\\" For a presentation to occur (whether the man is giving or viewing it), there should be some medium or device to display the presentation. In most cases, a screen or projector is the medium that displays PowerPoint presentations. Step 3: Assessing the Scenarios Scenario 1: If the man is giving a PowerPoint presentation, he is most likely standing near the screen or projector to present the slides and keep an eye on the content. This supports the hypothesis that the man is near a screen. Scenario 2: If the man is viewing a PowerPoint presentation, he should be able to see the screen or projector displaying the presentation. This means he must be in a position (likely not far) where he can clearly view the visual elements on the screen. This also supports the hypothesis that the man is near a screen (though it does not necessarily mean he has to be very close to the screen). Conclusion: We can reasonably conclude, based on the premise, that the hypothesis of \\"A man is near a screen\\" is entailed. Both scenarios (giving or viewing a PowerPoint presentation) require the presence of a screen or projector, and the man needs to be close enough to the screen to either present or view the PowerPoint presentation effectively."},{"question":"Translate \\"It should be stressed that this is not a technical problem, but a political problem, since this Council request compromises Parliament's budgetary authority, by attempting to fix non-compulsory expenditure.

Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Now, I have a new situation: Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil.

Despite being a bit hesitant about the hype surrounding this new culinary hotspot, we were all blown away by the top-notch service, incredible selection of dishes, and delightful ambiance that the restaurant had to offer. Upon arrival, we were graciously greeted by the hostess who promptly escorted us to our table. The restaurant was impeccably clean and tastefully decorated - a fusion of modern and rustic aesthetics, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for diners. Soft, mellow background music played throughout the evening, at a volume that was just perfect for a lively yet intimate conversation. The menu at \\"Delicious Delights\\" was nothing short of impressive. It featured a stunning assortment of appetizers, main courses, and desserts, with options catered to varied dietary preferences such as vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free. The drink menu was equally diverse, offering an array of wines, cocktails, craft beers, and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and highly knowledgeable about the menu. He was more than willing to provide recommendations and assist with any dietary inquiries we had. This level of service made us feel like valued guests, not simply customers to be served. We decided to share a few appetizers, which included the crab-stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese and fig crostini, and a Mediterranean-inspired mezze platter. Each appetizer was exquisitely plated and packed with flavor, setting the stage for a memorable meal. The ingredients were fresh, the presentation was beautiful, and the taste simply divine. For our main courses, I settled on the pan-seared salmon with lemon herb sauce, while my friends opted for the garlic-crusted rack of lamb, spinach and ricotta-stuffed ravioli, and the five-spice roasted half chicken. Once again, each dish was impeccably crafted and bursting with flavor. The salmon was cooked to perfection, moist and flaky on the inside with a golden-crisp crust on the outside. The lamb was tender and succulent, with the perfect complement of the garlic crust. The ravioli was rich and served with a beautiful roasted red pepper sauce, while the chicken was juicy, tender, and paired with an aromatic five-spice rub. No meal at a restaurant of this caliber would be complete without dessert. As we were quite full from the various dishes we'd sampled, we decided to split a chocolate lava cake with raspberry coulis. This dessert was the perfect ending to an already exquisite meal - warm, gooey chocolate paired exquisitely with the contrasting tangy, sweet raspberry coulis.

We're not economists, but we do have common sense. We tried to get help from Congressional staffers from both parties, as well as various watchdog groups and agencies. In the end, we found that the federal government wastes nearly 1 trillion every year. That's roughly equal to the amount collected annually by the Internal Revenue Service in personal income taxes. Put another way, it's also equal to about one-third of the country's 2.9 trillion total annual budget. And reclaiming that lost trillion could help wipe out the country's annual budget deficit , improve education, and provide health insurance for those who don't have it. So how do you define \\"waste\\"? David Walker of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a federal watchdog agency, calls it \\"the government's failure to give taxpayers the most for their money.\\" For our part, we used the kind of household test you would use on a piece of meat sitting in your refrigerator: If it smells rotten, it's waste. Our government regularly pays for products and services it never gets, wildly overpays companies to do things it could do more cheaply itself, loses money outright due to lax accounting and oversight, and spends money randomly on unnecessary programs. How exactly does the federal government waste your hard-earned tax dollars? We've identified what we consider ten of the worst ways. The best title for the passage would be _ .

But, even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really badly-made movie. The continuity and pacing were both simply awful. The best bits in the movie are under the ending credits, so it's (almost) worth sticking it out to the end (though, oddly, it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so). When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know there's got to be a problem...","response":"The sentiment in the given statement is primarily negative. Although there are some positive aspects mentioned, the negative remarks dominate the overall sentiment. The initial positive remarks mention the fact that the commentator wanted to like the movie and appreciated the location shots in Pittsburgh and the photography in the trailer. This introduction seems to set up a possibility for a balanced perspective. However, several negative points are made in the statement: 1. The movie is referred to as \\"really badly-made\\" which suggests fundamental issues with the production quality. 2. The continuity and pacing are both described as \\"simply awful,\\" which implies that the flow of the story was unsatisfactory and the timing was insufficient. 3. The best parts of the movie are only seen during the ending credits, which insinuates that there wasn't much to enjoy during the actual film. 4. The fact that the movie picks up a little bit in the last half hour is mentioned, but it is followed by the parenthetical word 'oddly,' which suggests that the improvements were unexpected and appear unrelated to the overall quality of the movie. 5. Lastly, the commentary states that when the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, it implies that there is a problem. This statement could suggest that the user does not hold a high opinion of Andy Dick's acting skills, and thus, considers his prominence as a negative aspect of the movie. In conclusion, the sentiment of the statement is negative, as the negative aspects of the movie are emphasized and surpass the few positive points mentioned. Even though there was an initial desire to like it and some appreciation for the filming location and trailer, the frustration with the movie's production and acting choices is made very clear, outweighing any positive sentiment."},{"question":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

While gazing at the image of a pumpkin patch, a dozen decayed arms punch through the wall clutching at her....She wakes from this surreal horror in the back of a helicopter. She's reminded she is living a real nightmare, looking down over a deserted Florida city, in which they land near an abandoned harbor. She is part of a team searching for survivors of a gruesome crisis that began almost a year earlier, a plague that started mysteriously and eventually collapsed human civilization. Her sometimes lover Miguel, an overworked and nerve-wracked soldier, calls for survivors on a bullhorn as they stand on the edge of the street of this now decaying town. Amid the scattered palm fronds, a newspaper blows in the death-scented wind near an early century federal building. It's big bold headline: THE DEAD WALK!

Her father got lost trying to find his wife in the hospital after a routine appointment and was missing for several hours before she found him. When Alita Aldridge got a call from her mother accusing her grandson of taking money and stealing her food, she, too, knew something was wrong. Her mother had always been loving and rarely raised her voice. Suddenly, expletives peppered her outbursts. Though their symptoms were different, both women's parents were ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a brain-wasting illness that afflicts 5.4 million people in the USA, destroying memory, thinking and personality. It also takes a heavy toll on caregivers. The Frosts got a quick diagnosis and started mapping out their future. But Aldridge says her mother's condition went undetected for several years, and the personality changes distanced her from her family and finally landed her in the emergency room. \\"I didn't know very much about Alzheimer's disease,\\" she says. \\"I thought memory was affected, but I didn't think personality was. My mother's personality had changed. We even went to a doctor who said my mother was fine. What were we supposed to do at that point?\\" Starting Sunday, researchers at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2012 in Vancouver, Canada, will discuss new findings on early warning signs to evaluate cognitive function sooner and on new therapies that might slow the disease's progression. The conference is expected to draw 5,000 researchers from around the world, and it follows the U.S. government's announcement in May of an ambitious plan to increase awareness and find a way to prevent the disease by 2025. Nearly half of those 85 and older have it, and the number is expected to be 16 million by 2050. Here are 10 warning signs of Alzheimer’s disease. People can experience one or more of these symptoms in different degrees: 1. Memory loss that disrupts daily living. 2. Challenges in planning or problem solving. 3. Difficulty completing usual tasks at home or work. 4. Confusion with time, seasons or place. 5. Trouble understanding visual images (colors, shapes) and spatial relationships (distances). 6. New problems using words in speaking and writing. 7. Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps. 8. Decreased or poor judgment. 9. Withdrawal from work or social activities. 10. Changes in mood or personality. By Janice Lloyd, USA TODAY Source: Alzheimer’s Association. More information at alz.org Alzheimer's is the second-most-feared disease — behind only cancer, says Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services for the Alzheimer's Association. Even though there is no cure, early diagnosis is the ticket, she says: People can treat symptoms and plan for their future while they're still able. \\"People can also check that bucket list,\\" she says, and \\"maybe reprioritize.\\" Karen Frost, 44, says she and her siblings noticed their father, Bill, had been losing bits of vocabulary for several years. Part of normal aging, they thought. But when he got lost in the hospital five years ago, the family headed to experts for an answer. He was hospitalized for three days; doctors ruled out a stroke, then ran other tests, which showed he had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as early-stage Alzheimer's. It is often treated with Aricept, which improves certain mental functions. It doesn't slow disease progression forever, but it helps some patients for a while. He went on Aricept immediately. \\"When they told me I had Alzheimer's, my mood went down,\\" says Bill Frost, 74. \\"But that night I said a prayer. Ever since then, I've said I'll never, ever give up.\\" He took part in one drug trial and is participating in another. \\"I'm going to be the first person cured of this disease,\\" he says. Though current trials and several others about to begin probably will be too late to benefit Frost, research is showing the importance of early diagnosis. Once the process that destroys brain cells has begun, the disease is irreversible. But if researchers can find a way to catch it early and slow it down, they think they can prevent much of the worst damage. William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer at the Alzheimer's Association, says he expects antibodies already in trials to someday help prevent Alzheimer's by stopping the formation of harmful protein deposits called amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease. \\"There are a number of ideas out there for prevention,\\" Thies says. \\"The most prominent has been if you moderate the amyloid plaque, you moderate the course of the disease.\\" Thies has watched the evolution of preventive therapies before; he worked for 10 years at the American Heart Association and remembers when cholesterol-lowering statin drugs were given to people only after they had heart attacks. Now, they are used for prevention and are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the USA. When the government launched a plan in May to step up its attack on Alzheimer's, the National Institutes of Health chipped in 17 million for a 100 million trial. It is being discussed at the conference. The initiative is hailed by researcher Eric Reiman as \\"a new era of Alzheimer's research.\\" Reiman is with Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, which is partnering with the NIH, drugmaker Genentech and the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, home of a large family with a genetic predisposition to develop the disease at a young age, and who, Reiman says, regard it \\"as a curse.\\" An experimental antibody called crenezumab will be tested to see whether it can sustain memory and cognition in about 300 family members who are in their 30s. They have the gene for early-onset Alzheimer's but have not yet shown symptoms. Laurie Ryan of the National Institute on Aging says the timing of this trial follows others that have advanced the understanding of how the disease progresses. For instance, several trials concluding this summer are testing antibodies in people exhibiting symptoms, but some research suggests even that might be too late to start. The results are expected by October. \\"New research is telling us earlier intervention is better,\\" says Ryan, program director for the institute's Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials program. Nancy Frost, Bill's wife, wants more money for research. \\"AIDS was 100% fatal before the government stepped in and spent millions on research,\\" she says. \\"Now that disease is a chronic one like diabetes. They didn't cure AIDS, but they're controlling it. That's what we have to do with Alzheimer's. The Baby Boomers are going to be hit hard by this.\\" Her kids are aware of that reality; the disease appears to run in their family. \\"We think our dad's mother had it, and we're pretty sure his grandmother had it,\\" says Alison Frost, 49. David Frost, 46, wants to know if he is carrying a gene that increases his risk for Alzheimer's, but his physician \\"is resistant,\\" he says. Alita Aldridge, 60, knows that when doctors defer making a diagnosis, the result may be life-threatening. Aldridge lives in Los Angeles; her mother lived alone nearby. Last September when Aldridge stopped by to visit, she found her mother slumped over her kitchen table. \\"I took her to the emergency room,\\" she says. \\"It was horrible. They had to restrain her because she kept getting up. Her anxiety levels were off the charts. She had forgotten to eat.\\" Doctors there diagnosed her. Bertha Aldridge, 92, is now living at home with 24-hour care. She still recognizes her children and is gaining weight, but little holds her interest, not even television, says her daughter, who worries about how long they can afford the 24-hour care. Meanwhile, Bill and Nancy Frost are still making their own plans. That's another plus to early diagnosis, Kallmyer says: \\"No one wants to have a spouse or children have to take care of them,\\" and people with Alzheimer's can't monitor their own food intake or medications. If they have other conditions, like diabetes, they need close supervision. Last weekend, Nancy Frost says, \\"we filled out the forms for a life care facility in Corpus Christi. Bill can move into a memory care center when he needs to, and I can stay in assisted living. We looked at other places, but we like Corpus Christi, being near the beach.\\" One of Bill's favorite activities has hooked him on the move. \\"They take them out charter fishing every day,\\" says Karen Frost. \\"He's one happy man. \\"We have gained so much respect for him because of how he's handling this.\\" What was this article about?","response":"This article is about the importance of early detection of Alzheimer's disease, a brain-wasting illness that affects memory, thinking, and personality.

The video documentary then transitions, with excited background music, to show Noah's incredible adventure walking with dinosaurs. Noah, accompanied by paleontologist Thomas Huxley, tours the exhibit of animatronic dinosaurs, marveling at the detailed creatures. Their journey begins with the herbivorous Triceratops, followed by other magnificent species like Pachycephalosaurus and Stegosaurus. Noah takes every opportunity to ask questions, each query followed by Huxley's detailed and informative answers. This turns into an educational segment, too, allowing the audience to learn alongside Noah. As Noah's VIP tour continues, he encounters a nest full of Velociraptor eggs, and watches in awe as the eggs move and the baby dinosaurs start to hatch. In another shot, Noah is seen riding an Ankylosaurus with a loving and protective look in his eyes. Huxley explains that the Ankylosaurus was a plant-eating species with strong defenses, sparking a conversation on how not all dinosaurs were as fearsome as Noah had expected. The climax of the video takes place when Noah comes face-to-face with a massive Tyrannosaurus Rex. He stares up at the colossal creature with a mix of terror, excitement, and wonder. As the T-Rex approaches, Noah takes Huxley's advice to remain motionless, while Huxley reassures him this T-Rex is well-trained. Now more at ease, Noah uses this encounter as an opportunity to learn about the T-Rex, discovering their behavioral and territorial patterns, as well as their role in the ecosystem. He slowly gains confidence and becomes less afraid, eventually touching the T-Rex, much to his amazement. After an exhilarating day filled with adventure, Noah returns to The Ellen DeGeneres Show to share his unforgettable experiences. Both Ellen and the audience applaud Noah's courage and sense of curiosity. Ellen, impressed by Noah's enthusiasm, rewards him with a surprise dinosaur gift and invites him to join her on another episode as a special correspondent. The video ends with a montage of clips from Noah's journey, capturing the essence of his wonder, admiration, and growth.

He also hears a monstrous roar come from the woods and turns just in time to glimpse something white, hairy and massive at the edge of the treeline.Meanwhile, back at the resort, Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson) and his wife Ellen (Yvette Mimieux) arrive. Seberg, a former Olympic Ski champion, has fallen on hard times and has come to Colorado to see if his old friend Rill can give him a job. As they step into the main building, Seberg gets the brushoff from a worried Rill, and begins to feel that this whole thing was a bad idea. Rill, meanwhile, informs his grandmother, and owner of the resort, Carrie Rill (Sylvia Sidney) about what he saw and heard, and tells her that they should put up signs restricting access to the area and inform the sheriff. Carie, however, is put off by the thought of a story about some wild man-beast roaming the slopes hurting business, and convinces Rill that while no one will believe Heidi, his word is another matter altogether. She agrees that he should merely post signs around the slopes warning of possible avalanches, arguing that... A:","response":"In the movie \\"Snowbeast,\\" the character Gar Seberg is attacked by the titular Snowbeast, which is a monstrous creature hiding in the woods near the Rill Lodge and Ski Resort in Colorado. The Snowbeast is a large, white, hairy creature, neither fully human nor animal, causing panic and fear among the people attending the 50th Annual Winter Carnival at the resort. The attack on Gar is a significant event in the film, as it serves to solidify the presence and danger of the mysterious creature lurking in the woods. Prior to this, reports and evidence of the Snowbeast's existence were met with skepticism, particularly by Tony Rill, the resort manager. Even after finding Jennifer's jacket and witnessing a glimpse of the creature, Rill was still hesitant to warn the public about the monstrous threat. Before the attack on Gar, he and his wife Ellen arrive at the resort seeking employment from his old friend Tony Rill. Although Rill is preoccupied with the unsettling events surrounding the Snowbeast, Gar manages to get involved in the situation. His encounter with the Snowbeast proves to be a turning point in the film. As a former Olympic Ski champion, Gar's involvement and the subsequent attack on him make it harder for Rill and other characters to ignore or dismiss the looming threat of the Snowbeast. Furthermore, this attack on Gar adds tension and urgency to the film's plot, as the resort's management is forced to confront the reality of the dangerous beast lurking nearby. Owner Carrie Rill is particularly concerned about the potential impact on their business, choosing to keep the information about the Snowbeast under wraps from their guests. However, as the attacks continue and the danger becomes increasingly apparent, the characters in the film must make a collective decision to confront and respond to the terrifying presence of the Snowbeast in their midst. In conclusion, the attack on Gar Seberg by the Snowbeast serves as a pivotal moment in the movie. It establishes both the potency of the threat and the need for the characters to take action against the monstrous creature endangering their resort and the people attending the Winter Carnival. The Snowbeast's attack on a prominent and accomplished character like Gar Seberg reinforces the significance of the threat, forcing the resort's management to confront and respond to the danger lurking in the woods, and setting the stage for the film's climax."},{"question":"Question: Lolita can drink 3 boxes of milk during weekdays. During Saturdays, she can drink twice the number of boxes of milk than on the weekdays, and during Sundays, she can drink thrice the number of boxes of milk than on the weekdays. How many boxes of milk does she drink per week? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's break down the number of boxes of milk Lolita drinks each day. Weekdays (Monday to Friday): - She drinks 3 boxes of milk on each weekday. Saturdays: - She drinks twice the number of boxes on the weekdays, which is 2 * 3 = 6 boxes of milk. Sundays: - She drinks thrice the number of boxes on weekdays, which is 3 * 3 = 9 boxes of milk. Now let's calculate the total number of boxes of milk she drinks per week: Weekdays (Monday to Friday): - 5 days * 3 boxes per day = 15 boxes of milk. Saturday: - 1 day * 6 boxes = 6 boxes of milk. Sunday: - 1 day * 9 boxes = 9 boxes of milk. Total boxes of milk per week: - 15 boxes (weekdays) + 6 boxes (Saturday) + 9 boxes (Sunday) = 30 boxes of milk. So, Lolita drinks 30 boxes of milk per week."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? See options at the end Craig always had fresh honey compared to Hunter because Possible answers: (A). Craig lived next to a store selling local honey.. (B). Hunter lived next to a store selling local honey..","response":"Craig always had fresh honey compared to Hunter because (A) Craig lived next to a store selling local honey. This proximity to a source of locally-produced honey gave Craig a considerable advantage over Hunter when it came to accessing fresh, high-quality honey. Living next to a store selling local honey meant that Craig could visit the store more frequently to purchase the latest batch of honey produced by local beekeepers. This convenience not only ensured that the honey was always available at his fingertips, but also that the honey he bought was less likely to have been sitting on the store shelves for an extended period, losing freshness and flavor. Moreover, local honey is known to have several benefits that contribute to its freshness and quality. For one, it is produced by bees that collect nectar from flowers in the surrounding area, making it distinctly reflective of the local flora. As a result, local honey generally has a unique taste profile that can vary depending on the season and location. In addition, because it doesn't need to travel long distances from its production site to its point of sale, the honey undergoes minimal processing and maintains its nutrient-rich and flavorful properties. In contrast, Hunter had the disadvantage of not living near a store selling local honey. This meant that he had to either travel a significant distance to purchase high-quality honey or settle for store-bought, mass-produced honey. Such honey is often sourced from multiple locations, blended together, and subjected to more processing, which can result in a less fresh and less distinctive taste. Furthermore, store-bought honey may have a longer shelf life due to additives and preservatives, which can also impact the honey's quality and freshness. As a result of these factors, Craig always had access to fresher, higher-quality honey than Hunter, simply because he lived next to a store selling local honey. This allowed him to enjoy the unique taste and beneficial properties of the honey while also supporting local beekeepers and promoting sustainable and eco-friendly practices."},{"question":"Brown University is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, United States.

You don't need to paraphrase the context of your resources, but make sure that your answer is consistent and complete. What is the difference between oath, pledge & vow and where should each word be used? An example should suffice.","response":"The task is asking you to explain the difference between the words \\"oath,\\" \\"pledge,\\" and \\"vow\\" and provide appropriate usage examples for each word. To accomplish this, you will need to define the terms, discuss their differing contexts, and give examples to illustrate their proper usage. You also need to make sure your language varies for each question and that the answer is detailed, coherent, and relies on general knowledge of the English language. To avoid repetition, remember to use synonyms and alternate phrasings. If you use external resources for definitions or context, cite them within the answer. Here's an explanation that follows the outlined guidelines: An oath, a pledge, and a vow are all different ways of expressing a commitment or promise. Though they may seem similar, each term has its nuances, and their usage depends on the context in which they are used. 1. Oath: An oath is a formal and solemn promise, usually involving a higher power or authority as witness. Oaths are typically used in legal or official settings, such as when a person is sworn into public office or when testifying in a court of law. The act of taking an oath is called \\"swearing\\" or being \\"sworn in.\\" Example: When elected, the President of the United States takes an \\"oath of office,\\" swearing to \\"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\" 2. Pledge: A pledge is a solemn promise or commitment to do something specific or to support a particular cause. This term is often used in non-legal contexts, such as fundraising, or when members join an organization. Example: Students might make a \\"pledge of allegiance\\" to their country by promising loyalty and support. In another context, people might \\"pledge\\" to donate money to their favorite charity each month. 3. Vow: A vow is a solemn promise or commitment made with a strong emotional or spiritual significance. It is often used in the context of personal relationships, religious ceremonies, or moral convictions. Example: In a wedding ceremony, couples exchange \\"marriage vows\\" to promise their love, support, and commitment to one another for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, while all three terms refer to various forms of commitment or promise, the main differences lie in their contexts and level of formality. Oaths are typically associated with legal or official settings, pledges are often used in non-legal contexts like fundraising or showing support, and vows carry a deeper emotional or spiritual meaning often found in personal relationships or religious ceremonies."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Delegates will argue that it threatens a \\"spirit of openness\\" in schools. The Department for Education says it \\"makes no apology\\" for protecting young people from extremism. The NUT's annual conference in Brighton will hear warnings that counter-radicalisation policies are having the unintended consequence of stopping teachers talking about \\"challenging ideas\\" with their pupils. Fears over anti-extremism measures are threatening to \\"close down space for open discussion in a safe and secure environment\\", the conference will hear. There will also be claims that Muslim pupils can be unfairly targeted. The conference will debate proposals to call on the government to withdraw the Prevent strategy for schools and to develop an alternative approach to safeguarding. Delegates will hear warnings that schools are being discouraged from allowing pupils to debate controversial ideas and to develop their own \\"critical thinking skills\\". Teachers will say they have lost confidence in being able to talk about topical issues and that this could \\"smother\\" the discussion of legitimate political opinions. And they say that pupils should not be afraid that they could be reported for giving their viewpoints in a school debate. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, introduced last year, places a legal duty on schools to \\"prevent people from being drawn into terrorism\\".

While the shorter statement does convey the basic idea of an interaction involving bread between two women and a man, it misses several important details that are present in the longer statement. To determine if the longer statement is an accurate interpretation of the given statement, let us analyze the two descriptions point-by-point. 1. The setting: The shorter statement does not mention the room being sunny. The presence of sunlight could affect the mood and atmosphere of the scene, providing additional context to the interaction. 2. The older woman's attire: The shorter statement does not describe the older woman's clothing, specifically her blue shirt. This detail adds specificity to the longer statement, helping to paint a more vivid mental image, but may not change the fundamental nature of the interaction. 3. The loaf of bread over a pile of bagged bread: The shorter statement simply states that the older woman hands over bread. It does not specify whether the bread is a single loaf or from a pile of bagged bread. This detail may provide insight into the situation, suggesting that the older woman has multiple loaves of bread, indicating perhaps a bakery or another setting where bread distribution is a primary function. 4. Descriptions of the wife: The shorter statement does not provide any details about the wife's appearance or emotional state. The longer statement notes that she is smiling, has her eyes closed, wears a flower shirt, and a duster sweater. These additional details provide more context and may imply a friendly, relaxed interaction between the people involved. 5. The man's attire and actions: The shorter statement only mentions that the man is watching the interaction, while the longer statement adds that he is wearing a red shirt and glasses. This further embellishes the visual depiction of the scene. In conclusion, while the shorter statement \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman\\" does convey a simplified version of the interaction between the three people, it lacks many crucial details present in the more in-depth statement. It is not possible to confidently conclude that the longer statement is an accurate representation based solely on the initial shorter statement, as there is missing context that could affect the understanding of the situation. For a more accurate evaluation of the scene, additional information or context surrounding the event would be necessary. This could include descriptions of the setting, people involved, or any other relevant factors that may contribute to a thorough and complete understanding of the situation."},{"question":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is Beiderbecke's nickname?, using the article: On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\".

She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris .

He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated. - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934). - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888 9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34. - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874 16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler. - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period. - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882 7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

And I was wondering How would Kendall feel afterwards? Answer:","response":"It's difficult to determine exactly how Kendall would feel after moving to a new city for a better job, as individual experiences and emotions can be quite different for each person. Nevertheless, we can speculate about some potential emotions and thoughts that Kendall might undergo based on common experiences when transitioning to a new living and working environment. 1. Excitement and enthusiasm: Kendall might feel excited about embarking on a new journey in their life, particularly if the new job is more exciting or rewarding than their previous position. Moving to a new city can represent a fresh start, and the idea of exploring new surroundings may spark enthusiasm and curiosity. 2. Anxiety and stress: Transitions can be challenging and can naturally give rise to feelings of anxiety and stress. Kendall might feel unsure about how they will fit into the new job, and if they'll be able to form strong relationships with their new coworkers. Additionally, moving to a different city may involve logistical hassles like finding a new place to live, navigating a new transportation system, and acclimating to different social and cultural norms. 3. Homesickness and loneliness: It's natural for Kendall to miss their friends, family, and familiar surroundings from their old city. This homesickness can sometimes manifest as loneliness, especially in the early stages of the move when Kendall is still forming new connections with people in their new location. 4. Sense of accomplishment: Securing a better job in a new city can be a significant personal achievement for Kendall. As they find success in their professional life and adapt to their new environment, they may feel a growing sense of accomplishment and self-confidence in their ability to overcome challenges and make the most out of this opportunity. 5. Adaptability: Over time, Kendall would likely find themselves becoming more comfortable in their new city and workplace, as they establish new routines and build connections. This adaptability could lead to feelings of resilience and a newfound appreciation for stepping out of their comfort zone. 6. Personal growth and new opportunities: Finally, Kendall might find that the move has facilitated new personal and professional opportunities that they would not have otherwise encountered. This can contribute to their overall happiness and satisfaction with their decision to relocate. Ultimately, Kendall's emotions and experience would depend on their ability to effectively manage the challenges of a significant life transition, as well as their capacity for resilience and personal growth. Though it may be a difficult adjustment initially, the potential for positive outcomes and a more fulfilling life could outweigh the initial struggles."},{"question":"Information: - A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors. - The Beat Generation is a 1959 American crime film by MGM starring Steve Cochran and Mamie Van Doren, with Ray Danton, Fay Spain, Maggie Hayes, Jackie Coogan, Louis Armstrong, James Mitchum, Vampira, and Ray Anthony. It is a sensationalistic interpretation of the beatnik culture of the \\"Beat Generation\\" (and is sometimes considered one of the very last films noir to be produced.) The movie was also shown under the title \\"This Rebel Age\\". - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'. - A poetry slam is a competition at which poets read or recite original work. The performances are then judged by a panel typically of five judges, often selected from the audience, or sometimes judged by audience response. The judges usually give each poem a score on a scale of 010 (zero being the worst, ten being the best). The highest and lowest scores are dropped and the middle three are kept. The highest score one can receive is a 30 and the lowest is a zero. - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - The Beat Generation is a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-World War II era. The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s. Central elements of Beat culture are rejection of standard narrative values, spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - In grammar, inflection or inflexion sometimes called accidence is the modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. The inflection of verbs is also called \\"conjugation\\", and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions, postpositions, numerals, articles etc, as \\"declension\\". - William Seward Burroughs II ( / broz / ; also known by his pen name William Lee ; February 5 , 1914 -- August 2 , 1997 ) was an American novelist , short story writer , satirist , essayist , painter , and spoken word performer . A primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author who wrote in the paranoid fiction genre , he is considered to be \`\` one of the most politically trenchant , culturally influential , and innovative artists of the 20th century '' . His influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature . Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas , six collections of short stories and four collections of essays . Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences . He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians , and made many appearances in films . He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis , Missouri , grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation , William Seward Burroughs I , and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee . Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence , but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties . He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University , studied English , and anthropology as a postgraduate , and later attended medical school in Vienna . In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II , but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy , after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life , while working a variety of jobs . In 1943 while living in New York City , he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac , the mutually influential foundation of which grew into the Beat Generation , which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture . Much of Burroughs 's work is semi-autobiographical , primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict , as he lived throughout Mexico City , London , Paris and... - Jazz poetry is poetry that \\"demonstrates jazz-like rhythm or the feel of improvisation\\". The genre also includes poems written about jazz music, musicians, or the jazz milieu. During the 1920s, several poets began to eschew the conventions of rhythm and style; among these were Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and E. E. Cummings. The significance of the simultaneous evolution of poetry and jazz during the 1920s was apparent to many poets of the era, resulting in the merging of the two art forms into jazz poetry. Jazz poetry has long been something of an \\"outsider\\" art form that exists somewhere outside the mainstream, having been conceived in the 1920s by African Americans, maintained in the 1950s by counterculture poets like those of the Beat generation, and adapted in modern times into hip-hop music and live poetry events known as poetry slams. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - A poetry reading is a public oral recitation or performance of poetry. - Paranoid fiction is a term sometimes used to describe works of literature that explores the subjective nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a totalitarian government, or they can be internal, such as a character's mental illness or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).

Tracy hurt Austin much worse. Given the context: How would Tracy feel afterwards? Possible answers: vindicated, angry, annoyed","response":"To determine how Tracy would feel after hurting Austin, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. Austin hit Tracy in the throat: This is a hostile action taken by Austin against Tracy. Tracy may feel fear and anger because of this attack. 2. Tracy hurt Austin much worse: In response to Austin's attack, Tracy fought back with even greater force, causing more harm to Austin than she received. Now, let's evaluate the possible emotions: a) Vindicated: This emotion would imply that Tracy felt justified in her actions, and that she was satisfied with the outcome. Given that Tracy received an unprovoked attack from Austin and then retaliated more forcefully, it is likely that she may feel vindicated. b) Angry: Even after hurting Austin much worse, Tracy might still feel anger due to the initial attack and the escalating violence. However, since Tracy's retaliation was more forceful than Austin's attack, her anger might have been somewhat diminished by her counteraction. c) Annoyed: This emotion usually indicates a lower intensity than anger and might not sufficiently express the level of distress one would experience after being attacked. Based on the analysis, Tracy would most likely feel vindicated, as she defended herself against Austin's attack and caused greater harm to him, thus demonstrating that she wouldn't tolerate his aggressive behavior. While anger and annoyance may also be present, the sense of vindication would be the most dominant emotion in this context."},{"question":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Camping holidays older people in the holiday paradise in the Mediterranean","response":"Camping holidays, older people, in the holiday paradise in the Mediterranean.

The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations. The partitioning brought the creation of the modern Arab world and the Republic of Turkey.

Mike Pence is being sued over his decision to suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees in his state. Pence is accused of violating the Constitution by accepting refugees from other countries but not those from Syria following last week’s violent terrorist attacks in Paris that killed at least 130 people. The federal lawsuit was filed late Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana on behalf of Indianapolis-based nonprofit Exodus Refugee Immigration. “There is no border around the state of Indiana that prevents people from entering our state who may move freely within the United States,” ACLU of Indiana legal director Ken Falk said in a statement. Pence, 56, had halted Indiana’s plans to resettle Syrian refugees last week after European officials said a Syrian citizen was among the attackers in Paris.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"A: Honey is indeed associated with queens, specifically with queen honey bees. Let's break this down step by step: 1. Honey bees: Honey is a natural sweet substance produced by honey bees, specifically the worker bees. They collect nectar from flowers, mix it with enzymes in their stomachs, and store it in honeycombs within their beehives. The honey is then used to provide nourishment for the colony, especially during the winter months when food sources are scarce. 2. Bee colonies: A bee colony consists of three types of honey bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. Each type of bee has a specific function within the colony. The queen is the only fertile female in the colony and is responsible for laying eggs and reproduction. Worker bees are female bees that have not reached sexual maturity, and they perform various tasks, including foraging, processing flower nectar into honey, and caring for the queen and brood. Drones are male bees whose primary function is to mate with the queen. 3. Queen honey bee: The queen bee is the mother of most, if not all, bees within a colony and is crucial for its survival. Her primary role is to lay eggs, and she can produce up to 2,000 eggs a day during her peak season. 4. Connection to honey: Although the queen bee does not directly produce honey, she has an essential role in the colony whose worker bees are responsible for honey production. The queen's pheromones help maintain order within the hive and encourage worker bees to perform their tasks, including honey production. In addition, maintaining colony health and population is vital to support honey production because worker bees are required to gather nectar from flowers and turn it into honey. In summary, while the queen bee doesn't directly produce honey, she plays an essential role in a healthy bee colony with robust honey production by laying eggs and producing pheromones that maintain order in the hive. Without a queen, the hive would eventually collapse, and honey production would cease."},{"question":"She led the way into the cheerful schoolroom, where big girls and little girls were sitting about, amusing themselves in the quiet of a long Sunday afternoon.

The boys apparently had planned to kill the woman, who is the 13-year-old's mother, and eat her liver, Spokane County Sheriff's Deputy Craig Chamberlin told CNN Friday. \\"The 14-year-old came up with the idea of, 'Hey, let's rip her open and eat her liver,' but it never happened,\\" said Chamberlin. Instead, the older boy allegedly beat the woman with the handle of a sword, Chamberlin said, adding, \\"I think that was their original plan, to cut her open, but then they changed their minds.\\" The woman was left bloodied with head injuries after the incident Tuesday, and remained hospitalized Friday in stable condition at a local hospital. The boys were arrested after a crime spree that included auto theft, burglary and vandalism, authorities said. The injured woman was found in her home by deputies responding to call; nearby were two knives and a sword with a bent handle. After deputies found no sign of forced entry into the woman's house, a manhunt was launched for the two teenagers. Deputies were called to the home of the 14-year-old's father when the man realized his 2005 Dodge Durango SUV was missing, and shortly afterward a call came in about a vehicle hit-and-run. The Durango was found at the accident scene but the teenagers were not. Deputies then received a call of a residential burglary in process. \\"The place was damaged. There were kicked holes in the wall,\\" Chamberlin said, \\"Just malicious mischief.\\" A state patrol trooper spotted the two teens running from the scene of the burglary, they were caught and arrested. The teens, whose names were not released, were booked on juvenile charges of second-degree assault, taking a motor vehicle without permission, residential burglary , second-degree malicious mischief and hit-and-run, Chamberlin said. The son of the injured woman later told deputies that he had been taking \\"blue pills\\" and would never do anything like the alleged crimes while sober,\\" according to Chamberlin. \\"It could be anything, it could be ecstasy, it had to have been some type of opium, hallucinogen...We were never able to collect any (pills),\\" Chamberlin said.

He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \`\`water'' in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word--the unpronounceable circumpunct--out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Katherine arrives and she and Langdon then share a tearful reunion with Peter and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before dying.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person drinks less liquid happens, how will it affect pancreas produces more insuline. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case supposes that the person drinks less liquid, and we are asked to evaluate its effect on the pancreas producing more insulin. Let's consider the process step-by-step: 1. Food enters the small intestine. Drinking less liquid may affect the digestion process slightly as sufficient fluids help to break down and dissolve the food, but it is not directly related to insulin production. 2. The small intestine produces hormones. This step is essential for triggering the pancreas to produce enzymes and hormones, but it is not directly affected by the amount of liquid intake. 3. The hormones cause the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion. Drinking less liquid will not have a direct impact on hormone production and subsequent enzyme production. 4. The enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through tubes. Enzyme transport is not directly affected by the amount of liquid intake. 5. The enzymes help the intestines digest the food. Enzyme function and digestion might be slightly affected due to less liquid intake, but it doesn't directly alter insulin production. 6. The pancreas produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin and glucagon production is primarily influenced by blood sugar levels, not the amount of liquid intake. However, dehydration might cause an imbalance in electrolytes, which could have a minor indirect effect on the pancreas's ability to produce insulin and glucagon. 7. The hormones control the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin and glucagon help regulate blood sugar levels, and this process is not directly affected by the amount of liquid intake. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the person drinking less liquid does not have a direct effect on the pancreas producing more insulin. However, it might have a minor indirect effect through the influence of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance on overall metabolic function and hormone production."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A woman holding a drink cup is walking along the street talking on her cellphone.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The woman is pink.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The Anchorage Daily News got its copy from author Joe McGinniss (who is writing his own book about Palin and famously irked her by moving in next door) and it offers a look inside: Bailey alleges that Palin coordinated with the Republican Governors Association during her gubernatorial campaign, a violation of election law. The RGA paid for TV commercials and mailers, calling it an “independent” effort, but Bailey says Palin worked with the group on at least one ad (an allegation that was made at the time by the Alaska Democratic Party). State candidates are not allowed to team up with soft-money groups like the RGA. Palin was obsessed with minor slights and often sought revenge: “We set our sights and went after opponents in coordinated attacks, utilizing what we called ‘Fox News surrogates,’ friendly blogs, ghost-written op-eds, media opinion polls (that we often rigged), letters to editors, and carefully edited speeches.” Bailey is best-known for his involvement in the “Troopergate” scandal; he was the one who made a phone call to a trooper lieutenant complaining about Palin’s one-time brother-in-law Mike Wooten and asking why he was still employed as a trooper. In the book, Bailey claims Todd Palin had been feeding him the information on Wooten that he passed along to troopers. Bailey also alleges that Palin’s animosity toward Wooten influenced her choice of Morgan Christen for the state Supreme Court, because Christen had ruled in Palin’s sister’s favor during a custody dispute. Less than three years into her term as Alaska’s governor, shortly before her resignation, Palin allegedly sent Bailey a message saying, “I hate this damn job.” Click for more on the manuscript and its author.

Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities contributed a significant number of URLs extracted from tweets about Michael Brown and Ferguson. In December we expanded the collection to include content related to the July 17th chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, NY, and the reactions around the country to the acquittal of the police officers in both cases. The collection then progressed further to reflect the movement building in reaction to police violence against people of color. Today the #blacklivesmatter Web Archive contains news articles, blogs, social media, and other websites related to Ferguson, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, protests and demonstrations around the country, and seeks to document the movement as it grows and evolves.

This effort focused initially on the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The project received contributions from various partners, including another Archive-It partner, Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, which provided URLs from tweets about Michael Brown and Ferguson. Around December, the scope of the collection expanded to capture online content related to other crucial cases, such as the chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and the public's reaction to the acquittal of the officers involved in these cases. This initiative continued to grow and evolved into chronicling the broader movement against police violence inflicted on people of color, encapsulated in the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. The archive contains a variety of digital content – news articles, blogs, social media posts, and other websites, including videos linked within the archived pages. The article also mentions a purported threat against law enforcement officers in Baltimore. As per a statement from the Baltimore Police, they received a credible threat that several gangs, specifically the Black Guerrilla Family, Bloods, and Crips, had formed a partnership to harm police officers. Details regarding the origin or specifics of this threat were not elaborated on. Further context reveals that this situation occurred amid the ongoing demonstrations around the death of Freddie Gray. Notably, the Baltimore FBI office had previously issued a memo stating that the Black Guerrilla Family was targeting \\"white cops\\" in Maryland. Lastly, the article noted that Governor Larry Hogan had declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in response to escalating unrest and violence in Baltimore City. The article did not provide further details about this decision, aside from noting that an official press conference was scheduled to take place.

Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood.

Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.

Today, we are going to talk about who lives in houses. We will compare two types of households: 1. Houses with someone aged 65 or older living alone, like grandmas or grandpas who don't live with others. 2. Houses where children, who are younger than 18, live with their families. Did you know that some families have children, while others have elderly people living alone? Let's find out which group is smaller. To answer this question, we need to look at some data. Data means information that helps us understand things better. We can get this information from studies or reports. According to a study, we found that fewer households have someone aged 65 or older living alone compared to those with children under the age of 18 living with their families. This means that there are more houses where children live with their families than those where elderly people live alone. Why does this happen? There could be many reasons. Kids enjoy the love and support of their family, while older people may feel lonely. They may move in with their children or stay at special places called 'retirement homes,' which are like big houses where many grandmas and grandpas live together. In conclusion, fewer households have someone aged 65 or older living alone than those with children under the age of 18 living with their families.

William Turvill. PUBLISHED:. 05:43 EST, 28 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:37 EST, 29 December 2013. The Metropolitan Police is being sued for £50,000 over claims a group of six officers allegedly called a suspect a 'black b*****d'. Jonathan Billinghurst is taking action after officers ambushed him, smashing the windows of the Mini Cooper he was driving with baseball bats. He claims during the 'unconventional' arrest one officer turned up the music while his colleagues physically and verbally assaulted him, in a manner designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him. Scroll down for video. The Metropolitan Police is being sued by a man who was in a car officers smashed with bats arresting him. Jonathan Billinghurst has claimed that he was called a 'black b*****d' as he was arrested in North London. An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation found the police officers had used excessive force. But the Met Police claimed in its defence to Mr Billinghurst's claim that 'officers were permitted to use such force'. The High Court papers, which were filed in October, have emerged after the six officers failed to sue Channel 4 News for libel after the programme broadcast footage of the arrest. Specifically, the six claimed journalist Simon Israel had insinuated they misled the IPCC panel on evidence they had against Mr Billinghurst. But the case was thrown out of the High Court. The video showed the men shouting ‘attack, attack’ before running at the suspect's car, smashing the windows and windscreen and telling him to ‘get out of the car’ before pinning him to the ground. The arrest took place in 2008 - but the IPCC investigation was not completed until three years later. All of the officers, part of the now-disbanded Enfield Crime Squad, kept their jobs. But they have come under further. pressure now after Mr Billinghurst claimed one officer turned up the. music in his car as others assaulted him physically and verbally after. they had pinned him down on the side of the road. The. suspect, who was later jailed for two months following the arrest,. believed the officers were ‘muggers’ because most of them appeared to be. wearing plain clothes. He said the unconventional manner of the arrest was designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him. Mr Billinghurst has said he believed officers were 'muggers' because they were mostly dressed in plain clothes. In the video, police shout 'attack, attack' before running to the car and telling the suspect: 'Get out of the car' He also claims police failed to say. who they were. In its defence, the Metropolitan Police said officers. shouted ‘police, police’ and put a blue flashing siren on one of their. cars. They said Mr. Billinghurst ‘was informed that he was under arrest and the grounds of. arrest as soon as was practicable’ - though it does not specify when. this was. Mr Billinghurst has also claimed the officers took and failed to return his iPod, CDs and mobile phone. After. going to Edmonton Police Station, Mr Billinghurst was taken to North. Middlesex Hospital and treated for a cut on his face believed to have. been caused by flying glass. In. its defence, the Metropolitan Police said Mr Billinghurst was suspected. of driving a stolen car while disqualified from driving. Officers also. claimed that intelligence suggested he would be carrying a knife. Police have denied Mr Billinghurst's claim that they did not announce themselves as Met officers. The arrest took place in 2008 - and the IPCC judged officers had used excessive force at a hearing in 2011. They said smashing the windows was being used as a valid ‘distraction technique’. The defence also questioned the likelihood that Mr Billinghurst could win the action because the incident took place five years ago. Police said the arrest took place on the same road Mr Billinghurst's twin brother had died while being pursued by police - although the suspect, who was in the car at the time, has denied police were involved. In 2011, Mr Billinghurst told Channel 4 News: ‘I personally believe that they may have thought that I have… I may have links or connections. 'It could have been - not pulling the racial card or anything – but it could have been that because I'm a male, I'm a black male, they could have thought that I…or I must know somebody in a gang, or I must know who stole the vehicle or where it came from, but they were mistaken.’ The Metropolitan Police confirmed the claim had been lodged, but said: 'It would be inappropriate to comment further.'

OPT: [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"[iii] no The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In the field of logical reasoning and computational linguistics, entailment refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence necessarily guarantees the truth of the other. Essentially, if a sentence A is true, then sentence B should also be automatically true for us to say that A entails B. Let us examine the sentences you provided. Sentence 1: Pray for me. Sentence 2: Don't bother praying for me. The first sentence is a request or command for someone to pray for the speaker. It suggests that the person speaking has faith or belief in prayer and desires someone to pray for them. The second sentence, however, directly contradicts the first by instructing not to pray for the speaker. Instead of expressing a faith or desire in prayer, it discourages it. So, it suggests that the speaker might believe that prayer won't help their situation, or they simply don't want to trouble the person they are speaking to with their concerns. It's a direct negation of the first sentence. Because these two sentences express two inherently opposing directives – one asking for prayer, the other rejecting it – the truth or occurrence of one does not guarantee or necessitate the truth or occurrence of the other. Thus, according to the principles of entailment, it cannot be said that the second sentence is entailed by the first.

Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Grace Jones was born in 1948 (though most sources say 1952) in Spanish Town, Jamaica, the daughter of Marjorie (nee Williams) and Robert W. Jones, who was a local politician and Apostolic clergyman. The couple already had two children, and would go on to have four more. Robert and Marjorie moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Robert worked as an agricultural labourer until a spiritual experience during a failed suicide attempt inspired him to become a Pentecostal minister. While they were in the US, they left their children with Marjorie's mother and her new husband, Peart. Jones knew him as \\"Mas P\\" ('Master P') and later noted that she \\"absolutely hated him\\"; as a strict disciplinarian he regularly beat the children in his care, representing what Jones described as \\"serious abuse\\". She was raised into the family's Pentecostal faith, having to take part in prayer meetings and Bible readings every night. She initially attended the Pentecostal All Saints School, before being sent to a nearby public school. As a child, shy Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her \\"skinny frame\\", but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica. Marjorie and Robert eventually brought their children - including the 13 year old Grace - to live with them in the US, where they had settled in Lyncourt, Salina, New York, near Syracuse. It was in the city that her father had established his own ministry, the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, in 1956. Jones continued her schooling and after she graduated, enrolled at Onondaga Community College majoring in Spanish. Jones began to rebel against her parents and their religion; she began wearing makeup, drinking alcohol, and visiting gay clubs with her brother. At college, she also took a theatre class, with her drama teacher convincing her to join him on a summer stock tour in Philadelphia. Arriving in the city, she decided to stay there, immersing herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as \\"a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental exercise was good for me\\". She moved back to New York at 18 and signed on as a model with Wilhelmina Modelling agency. She moved to Paris in 1970. The Parisian fashion scene was receptive to Jones' unusual, androgynous, bold, dark-skinned appearance. Yves St. Laurent, Claude Montana, and Kenzo Takada hired her for runway modelling, and she appeared on the covers of Elle, Vogue, and Stern working with Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer. Jones also modelled for Azzedine Alaia, and was frequently photographed promoting his line. While modelling in Paris, she shared an apartment with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. Hall and Jones frequented Le Sept, one of Paris's most popular gay clubs of the 1970s and '80s, and socialised with Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. In 1973, Jones appeared on the cover of a reissue of Billy Paul's 1970 album Ebony Woman.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Article: Everyone seems to be in favor of progress. But \\"progress\\" is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean that something has become stronger, wiser or better. It simply means changing it from being one thing to another and sometimes it turns out to be worse than before. Consider medicine, for instance. No one can deny that medical progress has enriched our lives greatly. Because of medical advancements, we eat better, live easier and are able to take care of ourselves more efficiently. We can cure disease with no more than one injection or a pill. If we have a serious accident, doctors can put us back together again. If we are born with something defective , they can repair it. They can ease our pain, replace worn parts and give us children. They can even bring us back from death. These are wonderful achievements, but there is a price we have to pay. Because medicine has reduced death, the population has been rising steadily, in spite of serious efforts to reduce the rate of population growth. A child born in the United States today has better than a 90% chance of survival .

Waivers serve as a labor management procedure used by the teams within this league. The text explains that when a player is placed on waivers, their contract and the rights that the team has to the player are made available to all the other teams participating in the league. This process is designed to permit other teams to waive their claim on a player, meaning they choose not to acquire the player, especially if said player is being assigned to the AHL or designated for release. With this information in mind, putting a player on waivers means that the team who currently has the player under contract is making that player's contract and rights available to the other teams in the league. It is an opportunity for other teams to claim the player or waive their claim on the player, depending on their interest and requirements.

The average crop per hive was down 72% compared to last year, with just 3.6kg (81b) of honey produced compared to an annual average, the annual honey survey by the BBKA revealed. The survey of 2,712 beekeepers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales found that 88% said this summer's bad weather caused the _ in honey yields. The bad weather made it difficult for bees to excrete ,which led to disease easily, and the bad weather also increased the risk of keeping bees for heavy rain caused the places which bees regularly visited to meet natural disasters. The bad weather also influenced the plants flowering which increased the cost of keeping bees. The BBKA issued a midsummer warning to feed bees if necessary to avoid dying from hunger. But in London, which recorded the worst results with just 2.5kg (5.61b)of honey harvested on average, beekeeping experts said that in addition to the bad weather there was a lack of food for bees in the city. Angela Woods, secretary of the London Beekeepers Association, said, \\"Rather than putting beehives on office roofs, we encourage companies in London that want to help to look at different ways of supporting bees and beekeepers. We need more food for the bees and better-educated beekeepers.\\" Elsewhere, the weather was the main problem. Peter Hutton, a beekeeper in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said, \\"It has been the most difficult year I have known in my 53 years of beekeeping.

The piece of technology in question would be smart, able to tell you about the weather and where the nearest restaurants are. The good thing is you no longer need to wonder, because something like this already exists. And its name is Siri. Siri is a voice recognition application designed for Apple products and the concept has been around for almost a year. When Siri first came out it could only speak English, but now it has \\"learned\\" lots of new languages, including Chinese, Cantonese and Taiwanese, reported The Wall Street Journal. So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \\"hear\\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes. This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way. Fortunately, Siri isn't like that. It's not just \\"voice recognition\\"; it's \\"natural language understanding (NLU)\\". You can ask it things like \\"Do I need an umbrella today?\\" and it will know that you are asking about the weather, according to ABC News. \\"The key thing is NLU -... Question: What can be concluded from the article? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The biggest advantage of Siri is that it's NLU is rather than just voice recognition.\\"?

He has sold 14 million records worldwide and has released 12 studio albums as well as a few compilation albums which have included his previous hits in a reworked format. DJ BoBo has also released as many as 34 singles to date, some of which have charted high, not only in German speaking countries, but also in other European territories. As a dance music producer, his first big success came with the single \\"Somebody Dance with Me\\", which borrows its melody from Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me. The release of the album World in Motion in September, 1996, proved not only DJ BoBo's consistent presence in the charts, but with this album, Rene managed to break all his previous records. It took only a few weeks for the album to reach the No.3 position in Germany, which quickly was awarded Platinum for selling 500,000 units. In Switzerland, the album jumped from 0 to No.1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units, which was ranked in the top 40 albums of all-time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weeks. Shortly after the release of World in Motion, Baumann went on a promotional tour in Asia for twenty days, which was then followed by another one month-tour in Brazil, Chile and Colombia. In April 1997, DJ BoBo received his third World Music Award in Monaco for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" where he performed his single \\"Respect Yourself\\". DJ BoBo maintained his original sound and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements when he introduced his singing skills first on his single \\"Where Is Your Love\\", which was released in March, 1998. A month thereafter, in April 1998, his album Magic was released which managed to stay in the No.1 position for four consecutive weeks in his native country and earned him a Platinum-award for sales of over 50,000 units. In Germany, the album peaked at No.5 and spent total of 21 weeks on the chart, eventually earning the Swiss artist another Gold-award for sales of over 250,000 units. In May of that the same year, DJ BoBo received the World Music Award for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" once again for the fourth time. Soon after, his single \\"Celebrate\\" was released introducing his The Ultimate Megamix '99. During this time Rene and his crew were busy preparing for his \\"Life on Tour\\" concert as well as the shows of the Magic, which were watched by 250,000 people in 35 concert arenas in Europe. Shortly thereafter, DJ BoBo was rewarded with yet another World Music Award for being the \\"World's Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year\\" for the fifth time in a row. What hits did the album include?","response":"The article does not provide specific hit songs from the album \\"World in Motion.\\" However, it is mentioned that the album reached impressive chart positions, such as No. 3 in Germany and No. 1 in Switzerland.

Luckily we found his,\\" says a lawyer for a man who has been freed after serving 17 years for a crime he always insisted he didn't commit. Richard Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence that there is another man who bears an uncanny resemblance to him and that witnesses could not tell the two of them apart, the Kansas City Star reports. There was never any physical evidence linking Jones to the 1999 robbery he was sent to prison for. Jones' girlfriend and family members backed up his alibi, but he was convicted after witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified him. The victim testified last week that she can no longer be certain Jones was the robber. Jones says people in prison told him there was another inmate who looked just like him and had the same first name. No criminal case has been filed yet against the other man, who, unlike Jones, lived near the scene of the crime, the BBC reports. Jones was arrested months after the robbery after a witness picked his photo out of around 200 people named Richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo line-up in which Jones was the only light-skinned person. Jones, who became a grandfather while in prison, was released with the help of the Midwest Innocence Project. Kansas has no law compensating victims of wrongful conviction, but a GoFundMe page has been set up to support Jones' return to society. Expand this summary.","response":"Richard Jones, a Kansas man, served 17 years in prison for a robbery he always insisted he did not commit. Jones was released by a Kansas judge after lawyers presented evidence revealing the existence of another man bearing a striking resemblance to him, leading to potential witness confusion. The similarity between the two men became the crucial point in eventually exonerating Jones. Besides their nearly identical appearances, the two men had no known connections. The case began in 1999 when Jones was convicted based on eyewitness testimony, despite there being no physical evidence connecting him to the crime. Jones' girlfriend and family members provided his alibi, stating he was with them at the time the crime took place. However, the witnesses, including the robbery victim, identified Jones as the perpetrator. Last week, the victim testified that she can no longer be certain Jones was indeed the robber. While in prison, Jones heard from fellow inmates about another prisoner who looked strikingly similar to him and shared the same first name. This other individual lived near the scene of the crime and resembled Jones more closely, based on certain distinct facial features and skin marks that the actual criminal was said to possess. No criminal case has been filed yet against this other person. Jones' arrest occurred months after the robbery when a witness selected his photo from a lineup of around 200 people named Richard. Other witnesses were shown a photo lineup in which Jones was the only light-skinned person. This method of identification was a significant factor that led to Jones' wrongful conviction. During his time in prison, Jones became a grandfather. His release was made possible by the Midwest Innocence Project, which helped uncover the existence of the doppelganger and provided essential support in proving Jones' innocence. Unfortunately, Kansas currently has no law compensating for victims of wrongful conviction. As a result, a GoFundMe page has been set up to help support Jones in his return to society."},{"question":"\\"Mike Tyson competed on the United States Olympic Gymnastics team.\\" Is the above claim true? Options: - yes - no Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"The claim that \\"Mike Tyson competed on the United States Olympic Gymnastics team\\" is not true. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Mike Tyson is known primarily as a professional boxer, not a gymnast. He competed in the heavyweight division and held the title of the youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20. 2. The United States Olympic Gymnastics team usually consists of athletes who have devoted their entire careers to the sport of gymnastics. Given Tyson's background and accomplishments in boxing, it is unlikely that he would have pursued gymnastics as well. 3. There are no records or sources that support the claim that Mike Tyson ever competed on the United States Olympic Gymnastics team or in any gymnastics competition. Based on this reasoning process, the answer to the claim is: no, Mike Tyson did not compete on the United States Olympic Gymnastics team."},{"question":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

We bought three of these and they all mysteriously stopped working. Check out the reviews on the internet and DO NOT BUY!","response":"Based on the information provided in the review, it is evident that the customer is highly dissatisfied with the product. There are multiple reasons to support this conclusion, as discussed in detail below: 1. Negative Title: The customer has chosen the word \\"junk\\" to title their review. This term carries a negative connotation and implies that the product is of very poor quality. Moreover, the phrase \\"JUST STOPS WORKING!\\" showcases the customer's frustration with the product's functionality. 2. Description of the Product as a \\"Piece of Junk\\": Calling a product a \\"piece of junk\\" implies that it is of extremely low quality and useless. This negative description suggests that the customer is unhappy with the product and its performance. 3. Faulty Items: The customer states that they purchased three of these products, and all of them mysteriously stopped working. This indicates a possible manufacturing fault or a design flaw, which leads the customer to feel disappointed and dissatisfied with the product. 4. Warning against the Product: In the review, the customer advises others to check online reviews and not to purchase this product. This demonstrates that the customer wants to share their negative experience with others in an attempt to prevent them from making the same purchasing mistake. This further supports the conclusion that the customer is dissatisfied with the product. Taking all of these factors into account, it is clear that the customer is extremely unhappy with the product and its performance.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I am going to be late, so I walk faster\\" - Sentence B: \\"I am going to be late, so I walk slower\\" Let's solve this gradually.","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's first understand the context and the relationship between the clauses in each sentence. Context: The subject is going to be late. Sentence A: \\"I am going to be late, so I walk faster\\" - In this sentence, the subject realizes they are going to be late, so they decide to walk faster to try and minimize or prevent their lateness. This reaction is logical because their action (walking faster) is congruent with their goal (not being late or minimizing lateness). Sentence B: \\"I am going to be late, so I walk slower\\" - In this sentence, the subject is aware they are going to be late, but chooses to walk slower. This reaction is not logical because their action (walking slower) is incongruent with their goal (not being late or minimizing lateness) and would, in fact, worsen their situation.

Although India supported the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam it was wrong to presume that it would turn a blind eye to Colombo's indifference towards resolving the Tamil question since the war ended three years ago. Its error should have been apparent to Colombo when Delhi voted for the resolution in the UN Human Rights Council castigating Sri Lanka for the abuses committed by its armed forces against the Tamil militants during the three decades of war. The parliamentarian delegation, the first high level one from India after the UN vote, was led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj. While MPs from the Tamil parties DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the AIADMK (All India Anna DMK) had withdrawn from it, the other members - including some Tamil speaking MPs - were also of two minds because of aggressive statements on the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu state by a Sri Lankan minister virtually on the eve of the visit. Despite the situation not being politically propitious, the delegation still went ahead. Sushma Swaraj made only one public statement at the end of the visit. She urged Colombo to \\"reach a genuine reconciliation\\" based on \\"a meaningful devolution of powers which takes into account the legitimate needs of the Tamil people for equality, dignity, justice and self-respect\\". The opposition leader spoke in the same voice as the government of India - suggesting that there was weariness across the political class in India with Colombo's reluctance to devolve power to Sri Lanka's Tamil minority. The shift in India's position towards Sri Lanka as manifested in the UN Human Rights Council vote has been ascribed to several factors. One theory is that there was a backroom deal between the national government and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa that she would allow the Koodankulam nuclear power plant in her state to become operational if the government voted for the resolution. Other theories are that the government was forced to keep the DMK in good humour due to coalition compulsions and that India gave in to US pressure to support the Washington-sponsored resolution on human rights violations in Sri Lanka. It would be an error to conclude, however, that such tactical factors alone were responsible for the change in India's position. What happens to Sri Lankan Tamils has an emotional and often a political echo in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Even during the conflict with the LTTE, while India supported military action against the militant forces, it always cautioned Colombo about protecting the rights of the Tamil civilian population and ensuring their welfare. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has assured India several times about his commitment to a constitutional amendment to devolve powers to the Tamils. It was passed in 1987 as a result of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord but its legality has been questioned in the Supreme Court. So although President Rajapaksa talks of a devolution process that would be more than that promised earlier - he calls it \\"13th amendment PLUS\\", there is uncertainty about what this would mean. Many ministers in the Rajapaksa government are openly opposed to devolution and the president himself seems to be backtracking on it. A parliamentary select committee which will make suggestions on the Tamil issue is yet to be set up. Colombo, however, has failed to read India's disappointment with bilateral efforts. If it had started negotiations for devolution with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the UNHRC resolution imbroglio may not have taken place. The all-party parliamentarians' delegation emphasised these issues - urging that a dialogue be restarted in which the TNA is given an honourable role and that the parliamentary select committee on devolution be set up soon. Most importantly, it left Colombo in no doubt that the Indian political parties were united on this issue. Having created an anti-West frenzy it may not be easy for the Rajapaksa government to back away from it. It derives its social power from a peculiar psyche - of Sri Lanka (that is, the majority Sinhalas) being isolated by evil powers. However, the Rajapaksa government could still move in the direction that Delhi is pushing it. While maintaining its anti-West, anti-imperialist facade, it could compromise on implementing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations. That would be the pragmatic way forward. Delhi after all is not seeking regime change in Colombo. The visit by Indian parliamentarians shows that the Indian policy of engagement with Colombo will continue unabated. However, so will the pressure for a permanent reconciliation with the Sri Lankan Tamils. Summary:","response":"An all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians visited Sri Lanka, emphasizing the need for a genuine reconciliation with the Tamil minority through a meaningful devolution of powers. Despite India's support for the war against the Tamil Tigers, it disapproves of Colombo's reluctance to resolve the Tamil issue. The Indian delegation, led by opposition leader Sushma Swaraj, urged the Sri Lankan government to engage with the Tamil National Alliance and establish a parliamentary select committee on devolution.

Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What field of ideas latched onto On the Origin of Species when it became a widespread success?","response":"On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin became a widespread success and latched onto multiple fields of ideas, influencing not only the scientific community but also other aspects of society, including ideological, social, and religious domains. 1. Scientific ideas: Darwin's work provided a robust and well-supported explanation of the process of evolution through natural selection. This profoundly impacted the field of biology, as it offered a unified theory to explain the diversity and interrelatedness of life on Earth. It also influenced research in other scientific domains such as geology, paleontology, and genetics. 2. Ideological ideas: The book sparked debates about the nature of humanity and our place in the world. It challenged the traditional biblical narrative of creation and instead endorsed the concept that all species, including humans, share a common ancestry. This influenced the development of secular humanism and rationalism, which sought to understand the world through reason, logic, and empirical evidence. 3. Social ideas: The concept of \\"the survival of the fittest\\" from On the Origin of Species was misinterpreted and applied to the realm of social policy, giving rise to Social Darwinism. This controversial theory advocated that human society and its institutions should be shaped by the same principles of natural selection that govern the natural world. It was often used to justify social inequalities, eugenics, and colonialism. 4. Religious ideas: While many religious groups found the book's implications challenging, others tried to reconcile their faith with the new understanding of the natural world. The idea of theistic evolution emerged, suggesting that evolution was a tool used by God to create the diverse spectrum of life. On the other hand, the book also fueled the debate between science and religion, leading to the development of modern creationist and intelligent design movements that challenge the scientific consensus on evolution. In summary, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species latched onto a wide range of fields, including scientific, ideological, social, and religious ideas, significantly impacting how people understood the world and their place in it."},{"question":"Concepts: city, market, village Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Sure, let's use these concepts of city, market, and village in a context. In the bustling, diverse city of Mumbai, there's a vibrant, sprawling market that is popularly known as 'Village Bazaar', and it brings together a blend of rural-village atmosphere along with urban-city lifestyle, offering a unique experience to locals and tourists alike. This market operates on weekends and is a venue that showcases the incredible depth of traditional artisans coming from the surrounding villages. The village bazaar is widely known for the wide range of local arts and crafts, vegetables, fruits, spices, fabrics, jewelry, pottery, handmade soaps, and other eco-friendly commodities, many of them being ethically sourced directly from rural village communities. The loud haggling sounds, the color splash of various items, the lip-smacking aroma from the local food stalls, everything establishes a vibrant atmosphere, making all visitors feel as though they have been transported from the heart of the city into a flourishing village market. Despite being located in the heart of the city, where modern, high-tech facilities are part of the daily lifestyle, the Village Bazaar in Mumbai has been successful in preserving a village-like charm. The aim is to create a platform for the villagers to sell their products directly to city customers, benefitting both sides. Visitors from the city get an opportunity to learn more about the rural village lifestyle, and producers from villages get a wider customer base for their products. What's more, the market often organizes different events, like workshops and musicals, by artists and artisans coming from the villages to emphasize and demonstrate village culture, traditional customs, and lifestyles. They use these events to tell stories about their village, their craftsmanship, their struggles, and the beauty of leading a simple life close to nature.

What is the ideal weapon to use in defending against a home invasion and why? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Pick your answer from: (i) no; (ii) yes;","response":"(i) no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address different topics and have distinct purposes. The first question asks whether Islam could be considered the best weapon against feminists. This question seems to be implying that there may be some kind of conflict or opposition between Islam and feminist ideologies. Feminism refers to a collection of movements and ideologies that seek to establish and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, and social rights for women. On the other hand, Islam is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the 7th century CE by the Prophet Muhammad. While some elements of Islamic teachings and practices may seem to clash with certain feminist ideas, it is crucial to remember that perspectives on gender within the Islamic community are highly diverse. Some interpretations of Islam lend themselves to a more gender-equal discourse, while others uphold traditional patriarchal values. Thus, using Islam as a \\"weapon\\" against feminism ignores the complexities of both belief systems and their potential for compatibility. The second question inquires about the ideal weapon to use in defending against a home invasion and why. This question is focused on the practical, safety-related aspect of home defense, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of various types of weapons available. The intention behind this question is to determine the most suitable and effective means of protection for an individual in the event of a forcible entry into one's home. In conclusion, these two questions are not paraphrases, as they address separate topics and objectives—one exploring the relationship between Islam and feminism, and the other focused on effective methods for self-defense against home invasion."},{"question":"Even if you've never visited Malaysia or Indonesia, it's likely that you've made contact with these countries through the chocolate bar you've just eaten or the soap you've just washed your hands with. Over 87% of palm oil, a common ingredient in thousands of consumer commodities, was produced by the two countries in the past year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Palm oil remains solid at room temperature, making it a remarkably versatile commodity used in cooking and processed food products like ice cream and cookies, as well as biofuels, agro-chemicals, and consumer products such as soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. As a result, demand for palm oil has been steadily rising since the 1970s, making it hugely valuable â€” and profitable. Last week, Malaysian state-owned palm oil conglomerate Felda Global Ventures Holdings debuted on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange in the world's second largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) this year. The share price of the world's third largest palm oil operator rose by 20%, generating US3.2 billion for the company. While the IPO has been a boon for the company's coffers, conservationists say the palm oil industry has been a curse for the environment in Malaysia and Indonesia. Palm oil production threatens tropical forests, peatlands, and wildlife habitats, environmental groups such as Greenpeace say. More than 10% of deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia over the last 20 years occurred to make way for palm oil plantations, according to a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). In Indonesia, an average of 300,000 hectares is lost annually to palm oil clearing, the report said. One of the major consequences of deforestation is the effect on climate change. \\"Because forested land, especially forested peatland, has a high carbon density, the production of palm oil on deforested lands causes disproportionately greater...global warming emissions than an equal area of non-forested land,\\" according to the UCS report. The group estimates that growing and refining each metric ton of crude palm oil produces the equivalent of 0.86 metric ton of carbon dioxide or 860 kilograms. Each hectare of carbon-rich peatland drained to plant oil palms releases an estimated 3,750-5,400 tons of carbon dioxide over 25 years, said Wirendro Sumargo, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. By comparison, he said, 500-900 tons of carbon dioxide are released from clearing a hectare of tropical forest without peat bogs. Oil palms also have less biomass than the natural forests they replace, meaning the trees store much less carbon dioxide, according to UCS. Once oil palms reach the end of their productive life cycle, the destruction of their timber also returns carbon to the atmosphere. To harvest palm oil in an environmentally safe way, high carbon stock forests, peatlands, and high conservation value forests must be avoided for development, said Sumargo. He added that the Indonesian government has routinely granted concessions for oil palm development in forested areas, which has led to widespread deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The UCS also claims the government issues land leases on favorable terms to an elite, influential pool of investors. For example, the Sinar Mas Group, which owns one of the country's leading palm oil growers-refineries, is controlled by the powerful Widjaja family empire. The company has been an ongoing target of heavy criticism from green groups for contributing to mass deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife. Over the past five years, Greenpeace has launched campaigns against snack food conglomerates, including Unilever and Nestle, after finding their products, such as Nestle's Kit Kat chocolate bars, contained palm oil sourced from the Sinar Mas Group. Deforestation forces large animals, such as tigers, elephants and orangutans, into small and isolated pieces of natural habitat, according to Sumargo. While the campaigns increased consumer awareness and provoked Unilever and Nestle to suspend their contracts until Sinar Mas improved its practices, much work remains to be done to make the palm oil industry sustainable, environmental groups say. For its part, the Indonesia government implemented a two-year moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests in May 2011, in a US1B deal with Norway intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions stemming from deforestation. Others point out that the palm oil industry has significantly alleviated rural poverty in Indonesia, where over 10% of the rural population lives below the poverty line. According to World Growth, over 41% of palm oil plantations were owned by small landowners in 2008, producing 6.6 million tons of palm oil. The palm oil industry contributes approximately 4.5% of gross domestic product in Indonesia, according to the USDA. Felda Global Ventures manages nearly 425,000 hectares of land in Malaysia and Indonesia, the majority of which is used for oil palm cultivation, according to its website. Its associate company, Felda Holdings, produced 3.3 million tons of crude palm oil in fiscal 2011, according to company spokesman Izan Hussain. Hussain said that company's last plantings of oil palms occurred in the 1990s. \\"Going forward, in newly acquired areas, where it involves planting in secondary forest areas, FGV will only do so after conducting high conservation value assessment,\\" he said. \\"We will only proceed if the findings indicate that no wildlife or endangered species will be affected, nor any social conflicts will arise from the development of the land.\\" The company has a program in place to obtain certification from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for all 70 of their palm oil mills by 2017, according to Hussain. He said that only eight mills are currently certified. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Sure thing, little buddy! You know the yummy chocolate bar you sometimes have as a treat? Or the soap we use to wash our hands? They might have an ingredient called palm oil. This oil is made in faraway countries called Malaysia and Indonesia and is used in a lot of different foods and things around the house. Now, palm oil is very useful and people really want it, so a lot of it is made. So much so, that people cut down big areas of forests just to make room for the trees that give us palm oil. This can be really bad for the home of some animals, like tigers, elephants, and orangutans. Also, when these forests are cut down, it contributes to what we call \\"global warming\\". However, there are some people who are trying to make the process better. They're looking for ways to make palm oil without hurting our environment. But, it's important for us to remember that our actions, even as simple as eating a chocolate bar, can have an effect on the world around us."},{"question":"Write the answer: Who founded the Mormon church?","response":"The Mormon Church, officially known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was founded by Joseph Smith Jr. Born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Vermont, Joseph Smith Jr. was an American religious leader who played a significant role in the establishment of the Latter Day Saint movement, which gave birth to the present-day LDS Church. During the 1820s, the United States was experiencing a period of intense religious revivalism called the Second Great Awakening. In the midst of this religious fervor, a young Joseph Smith Jr. began seeking answers about which Christian denomination was the true church. According to Smith, he received a visitation from God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820, who told him that all existing churches were corrupt, and he should join none of them. Between 1823 and 1827, Smith claimed to have had several angelic visitations, particularly from the angel Moroni, who eventually led him to the location of golden plates buried in a hill near his home in Upstate New York. These golden plates allegedly contained a record of ancient American civilizations who had migrated from Jerusalem centuries ago. Smith was instructed to translate the text engraved on these golden plates, which he accomplished by utilizing \\"seer stones\\" called the Urim and Thummim. The result of this translation was the Book of Mormon, which was published in March 1830. It is considered by adherents of the LDS Church to be another volume of scripture alongside the Holy Bible. The Book of Mormon tells the story of a prophet named Lehi and his family who traveled from Jerusalem to the American continent around 600 B.C. and the subsequent history of their descendants. At the heart of the Book of Mormon is the visitation of Jesus Christ to the American continent after his resurrection, as well as teachings about the organization and doctrines of his true church. On April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith Jr. officially organized The Church of Christ, which later became known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Fayette, New York. The founding members consisted of approximately 50 people, mainly close friends and family members. Joseph Smith Jr. served as the first President of the Church, and his close associates, such as Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, played crucial roles in the early development of the faith. Under Smith's leadership, the Church gathered its followers into communities in New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. Despite facing significant persecution, the Church continued to grow in numbers and extend its structure and doctrine, with Smith introducing new revelations and practices, including baptism for the dead, polygamy, and the concept of a theocratic community called Zion. The founding of the Mormon Church by Joseph Smith Jr. has given rise to a religious movement with millions of adherents worldwide, functioning as a separate and distinct denomination within the broader Christian tradition. Today, the LDS Church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and it has grown into one of the largest religious organizations in the United States, with a wide-reaching influence on American life, culture, and politics."},{"question":"Let's think step by step!

It’s a kind of tribute, in some sense, that the general coverage of his current troubles has reflected the detrimental effect of his influence over the years. Right now, the media, by and large, are focusing on tawdry \\"police blotter\\" acts of the very sort that have historically informed Murdoch’s own tabloid sensibility, while the bigger picture gets short shrift. To be sure, the activities and actions of Murdoch’s that dominate the public conversation at the moment are deeply troubling, leaving aside their alleged criminality. Still, what is really pernicious about Murdoch is not his subordinates’ reported hacking of phones, payments of hush money, etc., or the possibility that Murdoch may have known about, tolerated, enabled, or even encouraged such acts. It is, instead, the very essence of the man and his empire, and their long-term impact on our world and our lives. (For a detailed look at his practices, see for example this, this and this.) Here are 12 \\"take-away\\" points that are being obscured in the daily rush of revelations, and the related specialized coverage (his wife’s wardrobe and demeanor, the effect on his company’s stock price, etc.): He has transformed world politics for the worse : It was George W. Bush’s first cousin (John Ellis), working as head of Murdoch’s Fox News election night \\"decision desk,\\" who, during the Florida voting uncertainties, called the election for Bush and set off a chain reaction from other media. The eight Bush years that followed, and all that came with them, can in this respect be laid at Murdoch’s feet. Once Bush was finally out of power, it was two of Murdoch’s most powerful entities (Fox News Channel and the Wall Street Journal) that provided a regular editorial slot for Bush's \\"architect\\" Karl Rove to attack Bush's successor. Murdoch’s role on the state and local level has been no less significant -- in New York, for example, he has used his pulpit (including the New York Post) to advance the careers of sympathetic politicians (see the mayoral election of Ed Koch, for example) as well as to relentlessly promote local, state and national scandals (Lewinsky, et al.) that wounded or destroyed pols and candidates not in his corner. He has similarly influenced and shaped governments in the U.K., Australia, and elsewhere for decades. He has ridiculed and raised doubts about global catastrophes, and about science itself , while elevating absurd theories and hyping minor matters. For example, his outlets have played a leading role in dismissing and deriding scientific consensus on climate change, while creating hysteria about false issues like President Obama’s place of birth. He has undermined liberty : His outlets led the drumbeat for restriction or elimination of certain fundamental rights, including those under the U.S. Fourth Amendment, while at the same time supporting unrestrained wiretapping, the harsh treatment of suspects who may have done nothing wrong, and fueling panic justifying the buildup of the national surveillance state. He has turned the public against the press . By the generally inferior product produced, with a few exceptions, by the majority of the news outlets he controls and the tawdry methods sponsored by many of them, he has eroded the public’s confidence in media in general, tarnishing its belief even in those outfits whose work deserves to be taken seriously. He has also used his outlets to convince the public that other, more conscientious news organizations are ideologically suspect and biased. He has simultaneously propagandized for \\"the law\\" and compromised it . Murdoch properties are the leading hagiographers of law enforcement and the military -- while at the same time routinely assailing the patriotism of those who advocate for civil and privacy rights, who question wars, and so forth. Meanwhile, as shown by the unfolding U.K. drama, Murdoch himself stands accused of compromising the law enforcement establishment -- and not just in that country. (See his relationship with former New York police commissioner Kerik, who is now in prison, for example.) He has undermined essential rules about propriety in the news business , degrading ethical walls put in place through long tradition. He has used his properties to advance his personal interests, and made cross-promotion his trademark. He has propagandized for many of society’s worst instincts . Whether it involves advancing subtle racism or stoking greed, Murdoch and his minions have been out front. Fox News and the New York Post are best known for this in the U.S., but examples of various magnitudes may be found in almost all of his properties. He has until now effectively neutralized many would-be critics in journalism . As the news profession shrinks, his control over an increasing percentage of the paying positions makes journalists reticent to risk their jobs -- or the prospects of future employment -- by speaking out about his practices. The current flurry of revelations are only possible because of the sheer force of cascading events. He has relentlessly applied a double standard : Long a vilifier of others as communist sympathizers, he has created a pragmatic, but cynical partnership with the Chinese communist party dictators that has benefited him financially without helping (in fact, in some ways hindering) the prospects of democracy and freedom in that country. He has dumbed down the news business and hence the public . His tabloidization of the world has now come back to haunt him with a made-for-Murdoch-style story of an ogre-like entity hacking the phone of a murdered 13-year-old girl. This kind of story makes it impossible for him to defend himself on more nuanced, big-picture grounds. Nevertheless, where Murdoch and News Corp. are concerned, the broader activities hardly look any better. He has used his wealth regularly to stave off businesses and individuals that his company has illegally damaged . Multimillion-dollar payoffs have led plaintiffs and would-be plaintiffs to withdraw their lawsuits and agree to silence. ||||| NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- News Corp.

The reason behind this powerful decision is told in the flashback. Ramana is a happy professor with his wife (played by Simran) and daughter. And one day when Ramana is out to make some purchases, the entire neighbourhood collapses due to some fault in the construction and many of the residents including Simran and her daughter lose their lives. Ramana rushes to the Government Officials when he comes to know that all this was due to one person namely Vijayan, an industrialist with the necessary proof. But the incidents that he faces at the office, and on finding that these officials who are now corrupt to the core are mere puppets in the hands of Vijayan he gets frustrated on the situation and this makes him to form the ACF (Anti Corruption Force). 15 Thasildars are found missing and then the police find that 14 of them have been released after 3 days but one of them is killed.

A:","response":"In the plot provided, it is not explicitly mentioned who kills Vijayan. However, considering the storyline and Ramana's motivation to abolish corruption and bring justice to the death of his wife and daughter, it is likely that Ramana, being the protagonist and leader of the Anti Corruption Force (ACF), would be the one to ultimately confront and potentially kill Vijayan. As the movie's main antagonist and the person responsible for the corruption that led to the tragic incident, Vijayan's downfall is a crucial element for the movie's resolution, and it would be fitting for Ramana to carry out this act to seek justice and put an end to the main source of corruption."},{"question":"Saturday 10 February 2018 61829125 requests since Tuesday 16 December 2003 Could you correct the punctuation please?","response":"Saturday, 10 February 2018: 61,829,125 requests since Tuesday, 16 December 2003."},{"question":"Generate short a sentence that can be linguistically classified as (B).

TOULOUSE, France — As near to the Spanish border as it is to the Mediterranean, this sunny red-brick city has long been known as a place of welcome and diversity, far removed from the divisive politics of Paris. In contrast to much of the French south, the far right, with its virulent anti-immigrant stance, has little presence here. Nor does radical Islam. Toulouse is by no means without racism, anti-Semitism, crime or the deep social segregation that marks many French cities, but with a culture shaped by successive waves of immigration, it is described by its inhabitants as a place of particular tolerance. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled the Franco dictatorship into France after the Spanish Civil War, and many settled here. So, too, did the pieds noirs, the French expelled from newly independent Algeria in 1962, as well as the harkis, the Algerians who had backed the French colonialists, and thousands of Jews. In addition to a host of universities and research centers, the aerospace giant Airbus is based here, attracting engineers and scientists from around the world. So while Muslims across France speak of feeling vilified, this city has largely been spared the tensions that surround Islam. “It is true that from time to time we are subjected to hateful political discourse,” said Mohamed Tataï, the imam at the mosque El Nour in Empalot, a poor neighborhood. It is effectively imported from outside the city, though, he said, often around election time. “Afterwards, we’re able to return to calm once again.” There are concerns, though, that Mohammed Merah may have changed that. The seven brutal killings carried out this month by Mr. Merah — a 23-year-old son of Toulouse, and a professed jihadi — occurred during a divisive presidential race that had already turned toward questions of immigration and Islam. Even though investigators say Mr. Merah was effectively a lone, self-radicalized extremist, his violent ideology fits closely with some French stereotypes of Islam, and Muslims here fear that the tensions brought on by the murders may prove more lasting. “All of this does not correspond at all with what Toulouse is,” Pierre Cohen, the mayor, said of the killings. But “we’ve just come out of a very tense period,” he said. “Unfortunately, this risk exists.” Already, a false rumor has spread through the city, Mr. Cohen said, suggesting that Muslims were organizing a demonstration in defense of Mr. Merah. “There will be a ‘before’ and an ‘after,’ ” said Yassin Elmu’min, 23, a round-faced young man with blue eyes and short hair slicked into tight curls. Typically, Mr. Elmu’min said, there is “dialogue” between cultures in Toulouse, and Muslims are treated well. But he and other Muslims, many living in the poor suburbs outside downtown Toulouse, said they had already begun to detect nervous gazes that were uncharacteristic of this city. “Someone had the nerve to ask me, ‘Do you agree with what he did?’ ” Mr. Elmu’min said, exasperated. President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the rejection of “easy falsehoods” about Muslims last week, after Mr. Merah was killed by police commandos, Mr. Elmu’min said. “The ‘easy falsehoods’ are already here,” he lamented. A friend, Abd’allah, 19, dressed in a cream-colored djellaba beneath a hooded sweatshirt, said, “We’re the victims in the story.” He declined to give his full name, saying he feared trouble from the French authorities. Despite Mr. Sarkozy’s recent appeals for tolerance, many Muslims say he has done much to stigmatize them, pointing often to a 2010 law banning the Islamic full veil, or niqab, and to a debate on “the national identity.” Marine Le Pen, the presidential candidate for the far-right National Front, has been vociferous in her response to the killings. “What happened is not the matter of one man’s madness; what happened is the beginning of the forward march of green fascism in our country,” Ms. Le Pen said on Sunday, referring to radical Islam. “How many Mohammed Merahs are there in the boats, the planes that arrive each day in France, full of immigrants?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article talks about the city of Toulouse in France, which is known for being welcoming and accepting of different cultures and religions. People in Toulouse are worried that the recent violent actions of Mohammed Merah, who killed four people at a Jewish school, might make people more scared or hateful of Muslims. They are also worried about how these events might affect the way other people talk about and treat Muslims in France. The article also mentions that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has called for people to be understanding and kind towards Muslims, even though some feel that he has contributed to the negative views about them. Lastly, it talks about how a far-right politician, Marine Le Pen, blames these events on radical Islam and uses it in her political campaign."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who are sent to live with their aunt?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver 10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, \\"He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming.\\" Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond suggesting that Dylan work with the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson, who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson went on to produce the next three albums Dylan recorded.Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963. He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television. At the end of the play, Dylan performed \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", one of its first public performances. The film recording of Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968. While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies. He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.By the time of Dylan's second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer-songwriter.

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Ray hold the phone away from his ear? Options: - The woman was going to scream at him. - not enough information - It was a noble thing to do. - To show that he was listening.

The statement given in French refers to a stance taken by the speaker, explaining that they voted in favor of a resolution. This resolution revolves around the return and reintegration of detainees at the Guantánamo detention center. The Guantánamo detention center, also known as \\"Gitmo,\\" is a United States military prison that was established in 2002. It is located in the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and has been a controversial topic due to the treatment of prisoners and limited legal rights afforded to the detainees. The resolution in question likely addresses certain measures and steps to be taken to ensure a proper return and reintegration of the detainees into society. These measures could include providing psychological and medical support, assistance in finding housing and employment, and ensuring that the human rights of the detainees are protected throughout the process of their release and subsequent re-entry to society. The reintegration of former detainees can be a challenging task, as some may face difficulties in adapting to life after detention, reconnecting with their families, or overcoming social stigma. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential security concerns that may arise from the release of individuals who were previously detained on terrorism-related charges.

Montpellier prosecutor Christophe Barret says a woman called police to say she had been attacked at the facility in the village of Montferrier-sur-Lez, the Guardian reports. Officers arrived to find the body of another woman who had been gagged, tied up, and stabbed. The original caller was shaken but not badly harmed, police say. Security forces searched the building, which is home to around 70 elderly men and women, but could not find the attacker. Security at religious sites in France was stepped up after a series of attacks by Islamic extremists, but authorities haven't said whether the latest attack was a terrorist act, the AP reports. \\"For the time being, there is only one victim,\\" Barret tells AFP. \\"For the moment there is no particular evidence about the motive for this crime.\\" Earlier this year, ISIS attackers slit the throat of an 86-year-old priest in Normandy after storming the church during morning services.

A brave lady in the house called the police to ask for help because she was also attacked by the bad person. When the police came, they found the injured woman, but they couldn't find the bad person with the mask. They looked everywhere in the house, but the masked person had disappeared. The police thought this might be connected to other mean things done by some people called Islamic extremists. But they were not sure about it. Earlier this year, some other bad people, who were part of a group called ISIS, hurt an old priest while he was doing his job in a church.

On the way to Yazoo County High School on Tuesday, a girl pulled out a loaded gun and walked up and down the bus aisle, among 22 kids on board whose ages ranged from 5 to 18, authorities said. The 14-year-old girl ordered the bus driver to pull over and the driver did, they said. Eulls, 18, opened the emergency back door so the other kids could escape. He tried to distract the gun-toting student and then started negotiating with her, he told NBC's When the girl looked away for a split-second, his football instincts kicked in and he tackled her.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Disc records, which were introduced in the early 1900s, gradually came to replace cylinder records as the dominant form of recorded music due to their ability to hold more music and provide better sound quality. Despite advances in cylinder technology, such as Edison's Amberol cylinders and later the Blue Amberol Records, discs emerged as the more popular format by the end of the 1910s. This was followed by a proliferation of companies entering the disc record market after the expiration of basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records in 1919. Over the decades, disc records continued to evolve and improve. The development of the 33⅓ rpm long-playing (LP) record in 1948 and the 45 rpm single made vinyl records even more appealing for consumers, as it allowed for a greater amount of music to be stored on a single disc. The LP format was particularly popular with classical music listeners, who could now enjoy larger works without having to change records frequently. The next major shift occurred in the 1980s with the advent of the digital compact disc (CD). Developed by Philips and Sony, CDs offered superior audio quality due to their digital nature and provided added durability, as they were less prone to scratches and wear than vinyl records. CDs were also more compact and convenient, making them easier to store and transport. As a result, by the late 1980s, CDs had surpassed vinyl records in terms of sales, effectively ending the dominance of analog disc records in the home entertainment market. However, the rise of CDs was not the end of the story. The emergence of digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and the Internet drastically changed the way people consumed music. MP3 files replaced physical formats like CDs and records, as they could be easily downloaded and shared online. This led to the growth of digital music stores like iTunes, which offered a more convenient and accessible way to purchase and enjoy music. Streaming services, such as Spotify and Apple Music, have become the most recent development in music consumption, allowing users to access vast libraries of music without having to purchase individual songs or albums. This shift toward digital distribution and streaming services has further diminished the role of physical formats like CDs, vinyl records, and even digital downloads by negating the need for physical storage and making music more instantly available to consumers. In summary, while disc records initially replaced cylinder records as the dominant audio format in the early 20th century, they were eventually supplanted by newer, more advanced technologies like CDs, digital audio files, and music streaming services. These innovations have allowed for increased audio quality, convenience, and accessibility, continually shaping the way people experience and engage with music."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

Hypothesis: A man is sleeping on the ground .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclusively confirm the hypothesis as there is not enough information to determine the man's state accurately. The premise states: \\"A man with a crutch lying on the ground.\\" This statement tells us three essential pieces of information: there is a man, he has a crutch, and he is lying on the ground. However, these pieces of information alone are not enough to determine whether the man is sleeping or not. The hypothesis suggests: \\"A man is sleeping on the ground.\\" This new statement introduces the idea that the man is sleeping. It also states that there is a man on the ground, which aligns with the information provided in the premise. However, it does not provide any additional context or information about the man's state or why he might be sleeping on the ground. To conclude the hypothesis based on the premise, we need some additional information or context to confidently make an association between the man's presence on the ground and his state of sleep. For example, if the premise mentioned the man was lying on the ground with his eyes closed and appeared to be in a state of rest, then it might be more plausible to conclude that the man is sleeping on the ground. Similarly, if the premise included information about the man snoring or other signs of sleep, the hypothesis would be easier to confirm. However, the fact that the man has a crutch might suggest that the man is lying on the ground for other reasons, such as physical exhaustion, potential injury or accident, or needing a moment of rest, instead of necessarily sleeping. Without further information or context about the man's situation, we cannot confidently conclude the hypothesis based on the premise provided."},{"question":"Question: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense?

Let's analyze both sentences gradually to understand why: 1. Sentence A: \\"The effect of seeing dirty is a more refined mind\\" In this sentence, the phrase \\"seeing dirty\\" is quite ambiguous and does not form a clear connection with \\"a more refined mind\\". It is unclear what it means to \\"see dirty\\" and how it could contribute to a refined mind. The sentence structure appears grammatically correct but lacks clarity of meaning and logical coherence. 2. Sentence B: \\"The effect of seeing art is a more refined mind\\" In this sentence, there is a clear relationship between \\"seeing art\\" and \\"a more refined mind\\". The exposure to art can contribute to the refinement of one's mind, shaping their thoughts and increasing their appreciation for aesthetics and creativity. The cause and effect relationship is logical and coherent, making the sentence meaningful and sensible. In conclusion, Sentence A does not make sense due to the vague phrasing and lack of logical coherence, while Sentence B provides a clear and comprehensible cause-and-effect relationship."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: Outstanding Series!

Answer the above question based on the context below: India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country.... Answer:","response":"In the given context, the country that became independent in 1947 is India. Based on the information provided, in 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP. Therefore, the 2017 nominal GDP rank of the global economy of the country that became independent in 1947 is 6th."},{"question":"Haydn Austin Bunton (born 5 April 1937) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for North Adelaide and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as Swan Districts and Subiaco in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football's greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1984, Bunton junior returned to his former haunt of Subiaco, who as a result of the loss of such players as Mike Fitzpatrick had endured another bleak era over the previous nine seasons. The Lions had not participated in the finals since 1974 and had finished dead last in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1982, when they were in danger of a winless season before beating East Fremantle in the seventeenth round. Since 1975 Subiaco had recorded only 44 wins from 189 games and had lost its \\"average\\" game over these nine seasons by a margin of 36 points. However, under Bunton and aided by a powerful country zone, the Lions improved rapidly: from four wins and a percentage of 70 in 1983 they went to nine wins and a percentage of 100 in 1984 and fifteen wins and a percentage of 124.5 in 1985. Despite being in their first finals series since 1974, the Lions only just failed to beat East Fremantle in the grand final and gained ample revenge against the Sharks the following year by eleven and a half goals. Their team was sufficiently good to be competitive against VFL premiers Hawthorn in a post-season \\"challenge\\" match - ironically Hawthorn's win was led by Subiaco's one star of the bleak late 1970s and early 1980s in Gary Buckenara. An irrepressible Claremont outfit under the innovative coaching of Gerard Neesham halted Subiaco in 1987, but the following year after losing the second semi to the Tigers and being unconvincing in the preliminary against East Fremantle, the Lions, playing a much more traditional game than Claremont and aided by the controversial inclusion of West Coast Eagle Laurie Keene, ran away to win by 62 points after an even first half. The massive drain of players to the VFL meant Subiaco could not keep up this standard, and they won only six games each in 1989 and 1990 before returning to the Grand Final in 1991 only for Claremont to have its revenge. A thrashing by East Perth in the first week of the 1992 WAFL finals saw Bunton resign at the end of the season after having coached Subiaco's most successful era since before World War II. How did that affect Haydn?","response":"Haydn Austin Bunton was a very good Australian rules football player and coach. His dad, Haydn Bunton Sr., was also a famous player. Haydn Jr. played for different football teams in two states in Australia - South Australia and Western Australia. He was a strong and skilled player, and people admired him a lot. But it was as a coach that he became super famous, like his dad. When he went back to his old team, Subiaco, in 1984, they were not very good. They hadn't won many games in the last several years. But after Haydn became their coach, they got better very quickly. They started winning many more games, and even played in some big championship games called grand finals. People thought Haydn was a great coach because he helped the team improve so much. However, some challenges popped up, like many good players leaving to join teams in a different league called the VFL. Even though this made things difficult for Haydn's team, they still played well and even reached another grand final. Eventually, Haydn decided to leave his coaching job in 1992 after the team lost badly in a playoff game. Overall, Haydn's coaching career made a big impact on him. He became a very important person in Australian football, just like his dad. Haydn was recognized for his great coaching and was added to various Halls of Fame, which are special places where they celebrate and remember the best sportspeople."},{"question":"Robin gave them money for lunch.
