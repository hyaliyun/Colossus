Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - Hamden Khalif Allah Awad alias Ahmed the German ( actually Egyptian ) ( August 13 , 1970 -- August 7 , 1998 ) was one of the perpetrators of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least they're in the movie. But D'Abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it's all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all performed by an obvious double.

It is really amazing. But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this Documentary. It is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs. This is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste I found when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. The Documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this Documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the Croisette at the open-air cinema.

According to the rules, the robots could be defensive but could not be designed to destroy the opposing teams’ machines. The winners were a team dubbed ‘40 Piece Chicken McNuggets’ who created two identical rovers that drove instead of flew. In the final round, it came down to the McNuggets and a team called the Cunning Stunts, which used their budget to make three roving robots as well as one flying design. ‘This is where rubber meets the road,’ said Carl Ruoff, instructor of ME72: Engineering Design Laboratory told Pasadena Star-News. Competing robots get piled up during the 'Raiders of the Lost Can'-themed robotic Engineering Design Contest at the California Institute of Technology. A quadcopter takes off during the contest. Six teams of mechanical engineering majors are competing as part of a final project and core requirement, in which their robotic vehicles must climb or fly to get empty soup cans into an elevated five-foot target platform, while preventing competitor robots from doing the same. Avengers team members Erin Evans (left), Richie Hernandez and Joel Bryan (right) make robot repairs. ‘It’s all very practical,’ Mr Ruoff said. ‘You don’t want engineers making rockets that go into the ocean instead of into orbit.’ The ‘Soup Nazis’, a team based on the Seinfeld TV show, created a flying quadcopter named Elaine and a tank named Kramer. Meanwhile, a group called 'Team Avengers' took a defensive strategy with rovers named Iron Man and Hulk that could rundown opponents.

Gabrielle Giffords vows to return to Congress in a new book that details months of intense therapy and her emotional battle to come to terms with what happened when a gunman opened fire in front of a Tucson grocery store. The memoir, called \\"Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,\\" is the most personal and detailed look yet at Giffords' struggle over the past 10 months to relearn how to walk and talk, and her painful discovery that 12 others were wounded and six killed during the Jan. 8 attack. The Associated Press purchased an advanced copy of the book. It is set for release on Nov. 15. The book is written by Giffords' husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, but Giffords delivers the last chapter -- a single page of short sentences and phrases entitled \\"Gabby's Voice\\" in which she says her goal is to get back to Congress. \\"I will get stronger. I will return,\\" she vows. Giffords, 40, stunned colleagues by appearing on the U.S. House floor in Washington on Aug. 1 to vote for the debt ceiling deal, but she has focused most of her time on her recovery at TIRR Memorial Hermann, a rehabilitation center in Houston. In the book, Kelly recalls trying to tell his wife several times what had happened that June 8 morning, when Giffords was shot in the head while meeting constituents. But she didn't fully understand until March 12. Kelly asked Giffords if she remembered being shot, and she replied that she did. When he asked what she remembered about it, she said three words: \\"Shot. Shocked. Scary.\\" Later that same day, Kelly was reading to her from a New York Times article about her recovery and skipped over a paragraph that said six others were killed. Giffords, following along, knew he left something out and pushed him to tell her what it was. Kelly writes that after she learned of the deaths, Giffords was overcome with emotion and had trouble getting through her therapy. That night as they lay in bed, she told Kelly that she felt awful about all the people who were killed. He held her as she cried. Six months later, after being released from the Houston hospital to Kelly's home 25 miles away, Giffords wanted to know who had been killed that day. He warned her that it would be tough on her because she knew two of the victims. He started by telling her that her staff member Gabe Zimmerman died, which caused her to moan and cry in a wave of emotion. Then he told her about her friend, federal Judge John Roll, and the four other people she didn't know. Finally, he told her that Christina Taylor-Green, a 9-year-old girl born on Sept. 11, 2001, was among the dead. After she got the news, Kelly writes that he held her as she processed the information and wept. Kelly recounted the agonizing moments when several media outlets inaccurately reported that Giffords was dead, then described experiencing hope when he learned she was alive and being treated at a Tucson hospital. When Kelly first saw Giffords after the shooting, he wrote that he was shocked at her state: She was in a coma with her head partially shaved and bandaged, her face black and blue, her body connected to a bunch of tubes. He told her how much he loved her and that she was going to survive. He also describes the early days in Giffords' recovery and rehab in Texas, saying that the darkest moment came when Giffords panicked because she realized she couldn't talk. Her eyes were wide with fear and she was crying uncontrollably as Kelly tried his best to comfort her and assure her that she would get better. The book describes lighter moments, like when President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, visited Giffords at the Texas hospital. Giffords kept replying to Bush with the only word she was able to say: \\"chicken.\\" At another point, a specialist showed her various politicians to see if she recognized people. When she saw former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, she said: \\"Messin' around. Babies.\\" As she progressed, Kelly said Giffords learned to talk again, reciting the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.

At preschool he tried to govern every person, including the aides and teachers. Given the question \\"Why did Alex do this?\\", is \\"didn't like the other kids at preschool\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","response":"No, the answer \\"didn't like the other kids at preschool\\" is not a valid answer. Alex's actions seem to be the consequences of his upbringing rather than his liking or disliking of the other kids at preschool. In this case, the more valid explanation behind Alex's behavior would be due to his being spoiled and never disciplined by his parents. When parents spoil a child and do not set boundaries or establish a sense of discipline, the child may grow up with a sense of entitlement and a skewed understanding of social dynamics. They can develop the belief that their needs and desires should always be attended to and prioritized by others. This may contribute to the child attempting to assume control and dominate every situation they are in, even if it means trying to govern their peers, aides, and teachers at preschool. In Alex's situation, his parents' lack of discipline may have led him to perceive himself as more important and powerful than the other kids and even the authority figures at preschool. He likely believed that he had the right to govern and control because this was the environment he grew up in. This behavior is not necessarily driven by his feelings toward the other children, but is more likely a result of his upbringing. To amend this situation, it is vital for parents and caregivers, including the teachers and aides at preschool, to work together to establish clear boundaries and consequences for misbehavior. It is important for Alex to learn and understand his role within a group context, as well as respect the authority figures within the preschool. By creating a structure where his actions have consequences, both positive and negative, he will gradually learn the value of self-discipline, empathy, and appropriate social behavior."},{"question":"Instructions: This is a paraphrasing task.

This casino, as you might expect, caters to senior citizens. They're heavy on slots and video poker and have probably the largest bingo hall ever imagined. I met my parents there at noon on a Wed. and found that I was one of about half a dozen players in the 21-30-year old demographic. Most of the dealers, however, are young. One nice thing is that the senior demographic drives the blackjack minimum down to 2. So it's a good place to hone the 21-playing skills without hurting yourself too bad. I settled in at a 5 table and made it out with some cash. I did not see a craps table and the roulette wheel was automated (weird). I'm sure the younger players show up on weekends because there were more tables that were not open, but overall they do not have a large amount of tables. Definitely a good casino, and it is on tribal land. Be careful driving up there and back because Beeline Highway is heavily patrolled for speeders by the Arizona State Police","response":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed. The writer points out some positive aspects of the casino, such as its focus on senior citizens, a good place to practice blackjack skills due to lower minimum bets, and the fact that it's located on tribal land. They seem satisfied with their overall experience, having managed to make some money at the 5 table. However, the review also mentions some less-than-positive points. For instance, the narrow demographic, the lack of craps tables, the automated roulette wheel, and limited table game options might not appeal to all casino-goers. The reviewer also cautions about the heavy police patrol on Beeline Highway, which could be a potential drawback for those driving to the casino. Overall, this person had a more-or-less satisfactory experience at the casino, but they acknowledged that it might not be the perfect fit for everyone.

Yes or no? Answer: Today, Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat , sorghum and sunflowers . Question: who owned kansas before it became a state Answer:","response":"Before Kansas became a state, it was home to various Native American tribes and was claimed by several European powers. Initially, the territory that is now known as Kansas was inhabited by several indigenous tribes, including the Kanza (or Kaw), Osage, Pawnee, Kiowa, and Comanche. The first exposure to European influence came with the arrival of Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1541. However, there would not be a significant European presence in the region until the 18th century. In 1682, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, claimed the entire Mississippi River Basin for France, which included the land that would later become Kansas. In 1719, the French explorer Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont, traveled through the area and established a trading point near modern-day Fort Leavenworth. From 1762 to 1800, Kansas became a part of Spanish Louisiana after being ceded to Spain by France through the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Despite this, the French continued to dominate trade and relations with the Native American tribes within the region. In 1803, the United States acquired Kansas as part of the Louisiana Purchase from France, which included over 828,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River. With the new acquisition, Kansas was now under American control. However, it would take some time before the territory would be officially organized. Kansas remained relatively unsettled by Americans until the mid-19th century. In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed, which created the Kansas Territory and allowed settlers to decide whether or not to allow slavery within its borders. This led to a period of conflict known as \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" (1854–1861), as pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers rushed to the territory in an attempt to sway the vote. Finally, on January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the United States as the 34th state, a free state, after its anti-slavery constitution was approved. In conclusion, the land that became Kansas was originally inhabited by various Native American tribes and claimed by European powers such as France and Spain before being acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. The Kansas Territory was created by the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, and after a period of conflict over the issue of slavery, Kansas was admitted as a free state in 1861."},{"question":"Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

And the answer is...","response":"Alright kiddo, let's solve this step by step. First, let's look at the right side of the equation where we see 16*w - 5*w. Let's pretend w is a cookie. Your friend has 16 cookies and then takes away 5 cookies. So we can combine this as: 11*w + 39, because 16 - 5 = 11 So now our equation looks like this: -2*w = 11*w + 39 Next, we're going to add 2*w to both sides to get all our \\"w cookies\\" on the same side: -2*w + 2*w = 11*w + 2*w + 39 This simplifies to: 0 = 13*w + 39 because -2 + 2 = 0 and 11 + 2 = 13 Now we need to get \\"w\\" all by itself. We'll do that by subtracting 39 from both sides: -39 = 13*w The last step is to divide both sides by 13 to find out how many \\"w cookies\\" we have: -39 ÷ 13 = w That means, w = -3 (our final answer)."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Get a rag or soft cloth damp with warm water.

This indicates that there is more resistance and friction in the water than in the air.

He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School. At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic Society and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeist which he said took place at a haunted manor house in Shropshire. According to Richard Morris, in his recent biography Harry Price: On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a seance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event \\"attracted worldwide attention\\", thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further seances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the seances: It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters. \\"Spirit\\" or \\"trance personality\\" would be equally interesting explanations - and equally remarkable. There is no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment. Garrett's claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints by a technician from the airdrome. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's seances were \\"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did Eileen ever made contact with any noteworthy spirits herself?","response":"Eileen J. Garrett, a medium, claimed to have made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin during a seance held with Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research on 7 October 1930.

Additionally, Major Oliver Villiers participated in further seances with Garrett, during which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims of the disaster.

The Irish government today issued a passport to Kenneth Bigley, the British hostage who has been held in Iraq for almost three weeks, in an attempt to help secure his release.","response":"The situation described here revolves around Kenneth Bigley, a British citizen who was taken hostage in Iraq in 2004. At the time, he was working as an engineer for a construction company in Baghdad. His captors were reportedly from a militant group called Tawhid and Jihad, led by Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The group demanded the release of female prisoners held in Iraqi prisons, threatening to execute Bigley if their demands were not met. In an attempt to help secure Bigley's release, the Irish government issued a passport to him. This decision was based on the fact that Bigley's mother was born in Ireland, making him eligible for Irish citizenship. The move aimed to create a connection between Bigley and Ireland – a neutral, non-aligned country in the global context – and to appeal to his captors in the hope that such a link would increase their willingness to release him without further harm. The act of issuing an Irish passport as a means to save Bigley was a significant move, as it demonstrated the Irish government's dedication to humanitarian efforts and showcased a creative, non-violent approach to conflict resolution. In this regard, the passport can be seen as a symbol of diplomacy, friendship, and a potential avenue for negotiating the captive's release. However, it is important to note that this strategy might not have a significant impact on extremist groups, whose primary goals often supersede such diplomatic considerations. Furthermore, this gesture by the Irish government underlines the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in addressing the issue of hostage situations worldwide. Hostage-taking is a complex problem that typically necessitates the involvement of multiple political, military, and law enforcement entities. In such cases, the cooperation between nations can be particularly beneficial in facilitating the sharing of intelligence, resources, and expertise, ultimately increasing the likelihood of a peaceful resolution. However, despite the Irish government's efforts and international attempts to negotiate his release, Kenneth Bigley was tragically executed by his captors on October 7, 2004. His death only deepened the international community's commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms, working to ensure that innocent lives are not lost to hostage situations and other acts of violence. In conclusion, the Irish government's issuance of a passport to Kenneth Bigley aimed to exploit his Irish heritage and connection to a neutral country to help secure his release. Although this unique and commendable strategy did not ultimately achieve the desired outcome, it showcased the importance of international cooperation and creative diplomacy in efforts to resolve hostage situations and protect human lives."},{"question":"Sentence: Twilight's Aaron Turner is a Progressive Metal artist.

This response is closely related to the content of the paragraph because it focuses on fossils and rock layers but doesn't truthfully answer the question as it mentions size instead of index fossils. Part #2: Incorrect answer should be similar to the given correct answer. Usage: Fossils are used to match up rock layers by identifying the types of organisms that were alive during certain time periods. This response is similar to the correct answer, which states that index fossils are used to match rock layers, but doesn't mention index fossils specifically. Part #3: A good incorrect answer should prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question. Usage: Fossils are used to match up rock layers by comparing the mineral content of the fossils in different layers. This response prevents a reader who skips the paragraph from answering the question correctly since it's related to the concept of fossils but doesn't accurately reflect the information in the paragraph about index fossils. Part #4: The incorrect answer should not be trivial or easily eliminated without reading the paragraph. Usage: Fossils are used to match up rock layers by measuring the distance between different fossil layers. This incorrect answer is not trivial or easily eliminated because it introduces the concept of measuring distance, which may be considered plausible by students who haven't read the paragraph explaining the importance of index fossils."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

After being incorporated into the Sui dynasty, its economic richness was used for the Sui dynasty's ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into Korea and Vietnam. The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's Jiangnan East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the Tang dynasty, The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to North China plain and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang Dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of Wuyue. What is the answer to this question: When did the Six Dynasties end?","response":"The Six Dynasties ended in 589."},{"question":"Here is a goal: how to keep garbage disposal blades sharp Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","response":"To maintain the sharpness of garbage disposal blades, there are several methods you can use. Below, I will discuss the various ways to accomplish this goal, and provide a breakdown of which option might be more preferable depending on your specific needs. 1. Ice cubes One of the easiest and most efficient methods to keep garbage disposal blades sharp is by occasionally grinding ice cubes. Ice works as an abrasive that will help remove any residual food particles and other debris stuck on the blades. Additionally, ice helps to sharpen the edges of the blades and maintain their efficiency. Fill the disposal with a handful or two of ice cubes and turn on the machine, running cold water simultaneously. The ice cubes will break up and sharpen the blades in the process. 2. Citrus fruit peels Using citrus fruit peels is another effective method to maintain blade sharpness. Lemon, orange, or lime peels can be used for this purpose. The acidity in the citrus helps break down residue on the blades, while the abrasive nature of the peel scrubs off any lingering food particles. The citrus peels will also provide a fresh scent for your disposal. To proceed, cut the citrus fruit peel into small pieces and run them through the disposal while running cold water. The blades will become sharp and clean in no time. 3. Vinegar ice cubes If you want a more potent cleaning solution, vinegar ice cubes can be a suitable compromise between ice cubes and citrus fruit peels. They provide a combination of the abrasive nature of the ice and the cleaning power of vinegar. To make vinegar ice cubes, mix equal parts of water and white vinegar, and pour the mixture into an ice cube tray and freeze. Once the vinegar ice cubes are frozen solid, add them to the garbage disposal and run it with cold water. This method not only sharpens the blades, but also disinfects the disposal and gets rid of foul odors. 4. Baking soda and vinegar Another method to keep the garbage disposal blades sharp is by using a combination of baking soda and vinegar. Pour half a cup of baking soda down the disposal followed by a cup of white vinegar. Allow the mixture to sit for 15-20 minutes and then run water while operating the disposal. The chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar helps break down food particles and sharpens the blades in the process. Which method makes more sense? Each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The most convenient and easiest method is using ice cubes. It offers a simple and efficient way to maintain sharpness without needing any special ingredients. However, using citrus fruit peels or vinegar ice cubes might be preferable if you want to combine blade sharpening with removing foul odors from the disposal. The baking soda and vinegar method is also effective in sharpening the blades, but it requires additional waiting time. In conclusion, the best method for you to maintain the sharpness of your garbage disposal blades depends on your preferences, available ingredients, and the degree of cleaning required. Ice cubes are the most straightforward option, while citrus fruit peels and vinegar ice cubes offer additional odor-eliminating benefits. If you don't mind waiting, the baking soda and vinegar combination can provide equally effective results."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What has a life cycle with sexual reproduction?\\" and the following answer choices: - animals - insects - fungi - mammals - barnacles - bushes - tortoises - plants Now knowing that arthropods have a life cycle with sexual reproduction and insects are the largest group of arthropods, choose the best answer.

More Photos » WHEN it comes to life decisions, Clive McCarthy doesn’t shy away from grand leaps. The British-born electrical engineer was near the peak of a long career in Silicon Valley, where he directed chip and software design for the semiconductor company Altera, when he went in an entirely new direction. In 1997, around the time he turned 51, he took a few years off and then enrolled in art school. Then he began staging public performances with live avant-garde music and teams of painters who executed the large images he envisioned, and later he started devising art-producing algorithms, using TVs and computer monitors as dynamic “canvases” for his work. He also began dating Tricia Bell, a physician. In 2005, four months into their courtship, Mr. McCarthy showed her blueprints for his future home and studio in the city’s Mission district. When Dr. Bell, now 59, asked about a space labeled “Tricia’s Room,” he explained, “It’s a room you can transform however you please.” And if she ever became peeved with him, he told her, “it can be your little retreat.” It was a bold move so early in their relationship. But, he recalled, “I was already certain how I felt about Tricia, and I needed to make my intentions known.\\" Dr. Bell, who is now his wife, was charmed. The gritty fringe neighborhood where he had bought a 10,000-square-foot structure wasn’t where he had first planned to settle, but his efforts to build a contemporary home on upscale Russian Hill had met opposition. So when he unexpectedly found this 1925 concrete building amid auto body shops, he took the leap, buying it for 2.3 million. Originally a Lucky Strike cigarette warehouse, it had also been the home of Capp Street Project, an organization known for its experimental art installations in the basilica-like main hall, a vast concrete room rising 24 feet to a pitched skylighted roof. Ann Hamilton once blanketed the floor there with 750,000 honey-dipped pennies, Bill Viola installed an indoor redwood forest and Carl Cheng flooded the room like a swimming pool. The next owner had carved up the space, though, so Mr. McCarthy was unaware of the building’s art world provenance. But Stanley Saitowitz, the designer he hired to renovate it, remembered the warehouse from its Capp Street days and set about reclaiming it as a place for making art. “Clive gave us a pretty open canvas,” Mr. Saitowitz said. “We wanted to create emptiness: a playground for his experiments, for all the different things he works on simultaneously.” The idea was to restore the openness and rawness of the space by peeling away dropped ceilings, paneling and partitions, and then to insert into that rough setting “little jewels or set pieces,” he said, meaning discrete rooms or objects with greater refinement and intimacy. Now, where redwoods once soared, a spiral stairway encased in steel rods rises to a roof garden. Mr. McCarthy’s studio takes center stage in the big central space, where his “Electric Paintings” morph and regenerate on skeletal screens. One level up, on the original perimeter mezzanine, Mr. Saitowitz created pockets of domesticity, like a huge master bath lined in pristine white tile with a rain feature. In the open kitchen, a 39-foot silvery granite work island doubles as a dining table. Dr. Bell said she has never needed to retreat, peeved, into “Tricia’s Room,” but she has transformed it with a green wall like the one in the bedroom that recalls Mr. Viola’s redwoods. Meanwhile, the creative spirit of the building’s earlier days has spontaneously seeped back. Artist friends gather for group critiques, and when the couple invites avant-garde ensembles to rehearse or perform, the whole place resonates with music. Summary:","response":"A man named Clive McCarthy and a woman named Tricia Bell live in San Francisco. They turned an old warehouse, which used to be a place for making art, into their home. Clive is an artist and has a big space in the middle of the home for his artwork. They also have rooms for living, like a kitchen and a bathroom. The building's history of being a place for artists is now coming back to life, as they invite their artist friends and musicians to visit and perform there."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Songs from the Big Chair is the second studio album by the British rock band Tears for Fears, released on 25 February 1985 by Phonogram Records.

Here's the equation we want to solve: -597 * b - 9142 - 22638 = 432 * b + 35105 First, we want to get all the b's on one side of the equation, so we'll start by adding 597 * b to both sides: -597 * b + 597 * b - 9142 - 22638 = 432 * b + 35105 + 597 * b Now, simplify the equation: 0 - 9142 - 22638 = 1029 * b + 35105 Next, we will add 9142 and 22638 to both sides to eliminate the negative numbers on the left side: 0 = 1029 * b + 35105 + 9142 + 22638 Now, simplify the equation again: 0 = 1029 * b + 66885 To find b, we will subtract 66885 from both sides: -66885 = 1029 * b Now, to completely find b, we will divide both sides by 1029: b = -66885 / 1029 And when we divide, we get the answer: b ≈ -65 So, the final answer for b is approximately -65.

Coronaviruses most often infect the respiratory or intestinal tract. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a group 1 coronavirus, infects the porcine small intestine. Piglets up to the age of 3 weeks die from diarrhea caused by the viral gastroenteritis unless they are protected by antibodies. In addition to the cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N, the TGEV spike protein binds to sialic acid residues. We have shown that the sialic acid binding activity mediates the binding of TGEV to a mucin-like glycoprotein present in porcine brush border membranes. This was shown by performing a virus overlay binding assay with proteins obtained from brush border membranes by lectin precipitation. Because of the reactivity with specific lectins we assume that the recognized glycoprotein has the characteristics of a mucin.","response":"Title: \\"Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus in Piglets: Sialic Acid Binding Activity and Interactions with Mucin-Like Glycoproteins\\""},{"question":"Meidän Euroopan parlamentin jäsenten on tämän vuoksi tuettava riippumattomien tiedotusvälineiden kehitystä ja reilua kilpailua kansallisella tasolla. Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The sentence in Finnish says, \\"Our members of the European Parliament must therefore support the development of independent media and fair competition at the national level.\\" This means that the person is appealing to members of the European Parliament to drive the progress of independent media organizations and champion fair competition within their respective nations. This is typically seen as a crucial aspect of democratic societies. In European context, independent media refers to news outlets and entities that operate free from government control or influence. These entities can freely publish content and disseminate information without undue pressures or interventions from state actors, thereby ensuring a diverse and vibrant media landscape that captures a wide array of viewpoints. On the other hand, fair competition implies the existence of a level playing field in the media market, wherein no single entity has a dominant influence or control. This results in a more balanced and equitable presentation of information and prevents monopolies from skewing public discourse. The support from members of the European Parliament is important because these legislators have the ability to enact policies and allocate resources that can cultivate the growth and sustainability of independent media and fair competition. They can advocate for laws that protect press freedom, allocate funding for media development programs, or pursue other initiatives that reinforce the principles of independent journalism and fair competition. This can result in a more informed, engaged, and diverse public discourse that helps sustain democratic ideals."},{"question":"What key details about an kyong-ho can be extracted from the following bio?

As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal. Moss, an apt criminology student, forms a plan to \\"get inside the head\\" of Gacy, hoping to uncover new information regarding Gacy's murders and write a standout term paper on Gacy in the process.He sends Gacy his first letter, and is at first untruthful, telling him he has no girlfriend and a bad relationship with his supposedly controlling and abusive parents. He also states that his little brother, who is being bullied at school, sees him as a hero and would do anything for him.

Two former English Premier League winners, Leicester and Club Brugge, are set to collide in a UEFA Europa League clash that could very well serve as the turning point for the English side. Despite their growing unease on the domestic front, the Foxes remain hopeful of a positive outcome in their upcoming European adventure. The Domestic Quagmire Leicester City, the Cinderella story of the 2015-2016 Premier League season, has been facing some struggles lately. In recent months, the Foxes have faced inconsistencies in their form and fitness concerns amongst key players such as Jamie Vardy and James Maddison. Manager Brendan Rodgers has had his hands full managing an injury-prone roster throughout the season, with stars like Wilfred Ndidi and Timothy Castagne suffering recurring injuries. The relentless schedule, along with battling the giants of English football, has inevitably resulted in heavy burden on the squad. During this period, doubts over the team's ability to challenge for European positions in the Premier League or progress in European competitions have surfaced. Despite their impressive run in the first half of the season, cracks have appeared, and the club's domestic form is starting to falter. The European Escape Facing the heavyweights of European football is no lesser challenge than the domestic affairs. However, the UEFA Europa League presents teams like Leicester with a unique opportunity to focus on a different path to glory where they might face relatively easier opponents in the initial stages. Club Brugge, their Belgian adversaries, come into the encounter with their sights on causing an upset. Yet, the Belgian side, unable to capitalise on their position in their domestic league and with a recent underwhelming run of form, can very well become the well-timed boon for the Foxes. Leicester City can use this European fixture as a platform to regain confidence and rebuild momentum. Recapturing the Magic Leicester City certainly have the quality and capabilities within their ranks to pose a significant threat in Europe. In Rodgers, the club has a tactically astute and knowledgeable manager who guided them to a fairy-tale climax in his very first season. The attacking quartet of Vardy, Maddison, Harvey Barnes and Youri Tielemans can certainly weave magic when they combine, feeding off each other's creativity and imagination. Securing vital points in their Europa League group stage matches against Club Brugge can propel Leicester City further into the competition, rekindling the dreams of their supporters and reminding opponents of their title-winning season. Winning their matchup against Club Brugge would notch a pivotal three points and mark the beginning of a sublime European campaign. Conclusion The upcoming tie against Club Brugge offers Leicester City a chance to refocus, regroup and restore their might in the midst of their growing domestic concerns. It's a window of opportunity to heal the bruised spirit that has affected their league form and reignite the passion that once set the stage ablaze. It’s left to be seen if the Foxes can seize the moment and establish a new chapter in their already storied history. The European stage awaits, and Leicester City has everything to play for."},{"question":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Frustration that the British diplomats are feeling with be dealt with at the Summit on Thursday.

(A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given assent.) In 2011, campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse royal assent.

In the monarch's name, the Lord Chancellor can grant royal assent through an Order in Council, which involves receiving advice on each piece of legislation. This advice determines if the monarch should give assent, and thus full legal authority, to it or not. A notable recent instance when this advice led to the refusal of assent was in 2007, regarding proposed amendments to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark. However, a revised version of these reforms was later granted assent. In another case in 2011, campaigners against a proposed law aiming at reducing the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to suggest the Queen refuse royal assent to the said law.

Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee.

How to remove lead paint Get a do-it-yourself test kit. If your home was built before 1978 and you want to renovate it, you should test the area first to check for lead. Testing kits are easy to use and available at most home improvement or hardware stores.","response":"First, you need to purchase a testing kit suitable for testing lead paint. Once you have the testing kit, prepare the area that you intend to test by cleaning it with a damp cloth to remove dust or loose particles. This is important because lead can often be mixed with dust, and you want to ensure you are testing the surface paint and not contaminated dust. Following the instructions on the kit, typically you will need to rub a testing swab against the painted surface for a given amount of time or until the swab changes colour. If the swab changes to a specific colour (usually pink or red), this indicates the presence of lead. It's best to test in various places, including window sills, door frames, and walls - essentially, wherever there is paint. If the test comes back positive for lead, do not try to handle the situation yourself. While it may be tempting to try and remove the lead paint on your own, improper handling can lead to lead dust being released into the air, which can be harmful if inhaled, especially for children and pregnant women. Instead, contact professionals who are certified in lead removal. These professionals have the necessary training and equipment to safely remove or manage lead paint. This can involve a wide range of activities including enclosing the lead paint with a wall covering, painting over the lead paint with a special type of paint known as encapsulant, or completely removing the lead paint. In the meantime, limit access to the area proven to have lead paint, especially for children and pets. Keep the area clean by wet moping the surfaces and washing hands and toys often to reduce the risk of lead contamination. While the lead paint removal process may seem daunting, remember that it is a necessary precaution in ensuring the safety of your home. Always remember to take the proper precautions when dealing with lead paint and never hesitate to seek professional help if you are unsure."},{"question":"Note the options at the end.

In September 1816 Magistrate William Cox outlined his plan to Governor Macquarie to put five parties of soldiers, settlers and guides into the field to scour the Grose, Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers. There were no reports of Aboriginal casualties from these expeditions. Despite the apparent lack of Aboriginal casualties fighting ceased on the Hawkesbury Nepean River system in 1816. Governor Macquarie was generous in his rewards. Cox received payments in October 1816 and February 1817. Serjeant Broadfoot also received two payments. The guides received land grants for their services. Breastplates were made for Aboriginal guides. Macquarie's April 1817 report to Bathurst, while highlighting the success of his measures, made no mention of Aboriginal casualties. Apart from the silence of the land there are other records that point to something catastrophic happening to the Aboriginal people of the Hawkesbury Nepean in 1816. The Macarthur letters noted the absence of Aboriginal people upon their return in 1817. George Bowmans' 1824 memorandum to Magistrate Scott recalled soldiers indiscriminately killing Aboriginal people. The ministers, Threlkeld and Lang, both had stories of killings on the Hawkesbury. Prosper Tuckerman recalled his father tell him that 400 Aboriginal people had been killed at that time. In 1834, John Dunmore Lang wrote: \\"There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains.\\" Question: How many months passsed between Cox outlining his plan to Governor Macquarie and Macquarie's report to Bathurst?

After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington that the bridge in fact could be built. With great excitement and inspiration, and great hardships before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge in 1869.

In the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land, but by the Christianisation, previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined. Later on, in order to further strengthen Armenian national identity, Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet, in 405 AD. This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia, during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop's pupils. Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 AD to the rivalling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires, until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived.

This significant event took place in the early years of the 4th century, likely in AD 301. Prior to adopting Christianity, Armenia adhered to Armenian paganism, which was influenced by Zoroastrianism and later incorporated some elements of Greco-Roman deities.

The premise describes a sensational scene featuring crowds swarming among pyramids in eye-popping 3-D, with the camerawork being compared to Steven Spielberg's fluid cinematic style.

This contradicts the information provided in the premise, which clearly depicts a scene using 3-D technology. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported nor entailed by the premise presented. Instead, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it proposes the non-use of 3-D technology when the premise clearly demonstrates the incorporation of 3-D elements within the described scene.

The balloting, however, remains imperiled by calls for a Sunni Muslim boycott and a persistent insurgency that has roiled Sunni regions.","response":"This passage is about the potential challenges faced by a voting process or election in a region where there is a significant Sunni Muslim population. The balloting, which refers to the act of casting votes in an election or referendum, is threatened by two major issues: calls for a Sunni Muslim boycott and an ongoing insurgency in Sunni regions. The mention of a Sunni Muslim boycott suggests that there is a religious or political conflict within the community or between different communities. A boycott refers to a collective act of abstention from participating in an event, in this case, an election, to express discontent with the current political environment or decisions made by the authorities. Boycott campaigns, often organized by political or religious groups, seek to undermine the legitimacy of an election by reducing voter turnout and challenging the representative nature of the elected body. The reasons behind this Sunni Muslim boycott are not explicitly mentioned in the passage but may include perceived marginalization or disenfranchisement of the Sunni community, dissatisfaction with the candidates or political parties, or concerns about electoral fraud or manipulation. If a significant number of Sunni Muslims abstain from voting, it could weaken the mandate of the elected government and create further divisions within the society. Additionally, the passage references a \\"persistent insurgency\\" that has been stirring up trouble in Sunni regions. An insurgency is a rebellion or uprising against a ruling authority or government, often carried out by armed non-state actors who seek to contest and disrupt the existing political order. Insurgencies can hinder the voting process in several ways, such as by creating a climate of fear among voters, undermining the security and integrity of the electoral process, and potentially even targeting polling stations or election staff. In Sunni regions, this insurgency could be driven by various factors, including political grievances, sectarian tensions, or extremist ideologies. The ongoing violence and unrest could lead to the destabilization of the region and may exacerbate existing grievances among the Sunni population, further undermining the prospect of a successful and inclusive election. In summary, the passage is about the challenges faced by a voting process in a region with a significant Sunni Muslim population. The electoral process is hampered by calls for a Sunni Muslim boycott and an ongoing insurgency in Sunni regions. These issues not only threaten the legitimacy and integrity of the election but may also contribute to the deepening divisions within the society and impede any progress towards achieving political stability and social harmony."},{"question":"Jurisiç de, savaş zamanı kuzeydeki Tuzla kentindeki bir JNA konvoyunu konu alan ve 50'den fazla askerin öldüğü ve diğer bir 50'sinin yaralandığı bir olayla suçlanıyor.

And I was wondering Why did Kai do this? Answer:","response":"There could be several reasons why Kai reacted this way in this hypothetical situation. Keep in mind that the information provided might not cover all possible scenarios, as it is only based on the brief context you have given. Here are some possible reasons why Kai might have broken Casey's arm: 1. Self-defense: Given that Casey intended to attack, Kai might have acted in self-defense to protect themselves from harm. In the heat of the moment, they might have felt threatened and responded with force to prevent getting hurt. 2. Reflex action: Sometimes, the body reacts instinctively to sudden threats, without conscious thought. Kai might have unintentionally reacted this way due to their fight-or-flight response being activated, which led to the unfortunate injury of Casey. 3. Prior experience or training: If Kai has a background in martial arts or any other self-defense training, their skills might have automatically kicked in during a perceived dangerous situation. This could have led to their forceful reaction against Casey's attack. 4. Establishing dominance: It is also possible that Kai wanted to assert their dominance in this situation and deter any future aggression from Casey. By reacting so severely, Kai might have intended to send a message to Casey about not underestimating them. 5. Emotional response: Finally, Kai's reaction could have been the result of heightened emotions such as anger or fear, causing them to lose control of their actions momentarily.

When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job.

Sometimes, people who make rules like the government or our parents, decide that we need to follow some rules to keep us safe and happy. These rules are called restrictions. Now, when we say restrictions reach out to the general population, it's like saying these rules are for everyone to follow, not just a few people. Imagine in school when the teacher asked everyone to line up quietly, it's a rule that everyone in the class should follow. Now for the evidence part, which means finding reasons that show this claim is true. Evidence could be: 1. Laws: The government makes laws that everyone in the country has to follow. For example, there's a rule that says we can't steal, and everyone has to follow it not just some people. 2. News and announcements: Sometimes, when there's an important restriction, like wearing masks during these sick times, you might see it on TV or hear it on the radio, which helps everyone know about it. 3. Signs and posters: You might see some signs in places like malls, schools, and parks that tell people what they can or can't do. These rules are usually for everyone who visits those places. 4. Community rules: In some places like apartment buildings or clubs, there might be rules made by people who live there or who are in charge. They make sure everyone who lives there or visits knows and follows the rules.

I will create a fictional place called \\"The Urban Sea Cafe\\" as the subject of the negative review. Step 2: Determine the specific points that lead to a negative experience. Factors that contribute to a negative experience may include poor service, low quality or overpriced food, and an unpleasant atmosphere. Step 3: Provide context for the visit. To make the review realistic, I will imagine that the reviewer visited The Urban Sea Cafe on a Saturday evening to have dinner with a group of friends. Step 4: Write the review incorporating the factors and context determined in previous steps. Title: Disappointing Experience at The Urban Sea Cafe I recently visited The Urban Sea Cafe with a group of friends for a Saturday evening dinner and unfortunately, our experience was far below our expectations. Firstly, the service was abysmal. It took more than 15 minutes for our group to be seated, even though there were multiple vacant tables clearly visible. Once seated, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take our drink orders. Throughout the night, our server was inattentive and seemed uninterested in answering our questions or addressing our requests. The food wasn't any better. We ordered an assortment of seafood dishes, hoping that The Urban Sea Cafe would shine with its specialty. However, our meals were bland and lacked any semblance of fresh flavors that are essential for seafood dishes. The shrimp scampi was swimming in an excess of watery sauce, while the crab cakes were dry and unappetizing. Not to mention, the portion sizes were quite small considering the exorbitant prices on the menu. Lastly, the atmosphere in the cafe was unpleasant. The lighting was much too dim for a dining room, and the music was so loud that we couldn't carry on a proper conversation without raising our voices. Additionally, it seemed that they crammed too many tables into the relatively small space, making it difficult for us and the staff to navigate around the dining area. Overall, our experience at The Urban Sea Cafe was thoroughly disappointing. Considering the poor service, low-quality food, and uncomfortable atmosphere, I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone. There are countless other dining options nearby that provide better value and experience. Step 5: Review and finalize the review. Upon reviewing the negative review I have written for the fictional place, \\"The Urban Sea Cafe,\\" I believe it is complete, as it accurately details an unsatisfactory and disappointing experience, with a focus on poor service, low-quality food, and an unpleasant atmosphere."},{"question":"11 Voir l’article de Clare McNamara, « Food and the Future : Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Of course!

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik.

Question 2: What is the best type of sword in the world? OPTIONS: (i). no. (ii). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"The answer to both questions asked, \\"What is the best sword?\\" and \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" would indeed be closely related; however, the answer might not be exactly the same because of how these questions are framed, which focuses on separate aspects of the topic. In answering \\"What is the best sword?\\" it would be important to define what is meant by \\"best\\". Is it the sharpest, the most durable, the most historically significant, the most expensive or the most aesthetically pleasing? 'Best' is subjective and can refer to many different factors. For instance, some might argue that historically, the katana, a Japanese longsword used by samurai, is the best due to its sharpness, flexibility, and hardness. Others might argue that the Damascus Sword, known for its unique patterning and legendary sharpness, durability, and resistance to shattering, is the best. On the other hand, when trying to answer \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" we would also need to consider cultural, historical, and practical aspects. Different types of swords have been developed throughout history and across cultures depending on the needs and resources of those societies. A Longsword from medieval Europe, for example, was designed for different kinds of warfare than a Scimitar from the Middle East or a Rapier from Renaissance Europe. Specific types of swords might include the Katana (Japan), Longsword (Europe), Jian (China), Scimitar (Middle East), Khopesh (Egypt), and Rapier (Renaissance Europe). Each type has distinctive features and was created to meet specific requirements. The Katana, for instance, is revered for its sharpness and is best for quick, precise cuts. The Longsword gives the best results in a range of fighting situations due to its balanced design. The Jian excels in precision and agility, making it suitable for subtle techniques as seen in several martial arts. A Scimitar is considered optimal for horseback combat due to its curved design, which is good for slashing. The Khopesh was technologically superior during its time, with its sickle-like shape offering both slashing and hooking capabilities. A Rapier, while limited in slashing effectiveness, is unmatched in offering quick thrusting attacks. The key point is that the concept of 'the best' can depend largely on the context and the criteria by which 'best' is judged. What works best in one scenario might not work as well in another. Thus, the best sword or sword type is fundamentally determined by what it is that you need or want the sword to do – whether that be display, collection, combat, historical reenactment or something else entirely. Therefore, while the answer to the two questions may indeed be similar, they should also address these individual aspects of each query. The responses could indeed reference the same types of swords based on these factors, but they could also differ based on how 'best' is interpreted in each context. The given options (i). no. (ii). yes. do not seem to relate to these questions as they imply a yes or no response. Both questions require a much more nuanced and detailed answer than a simple yes or no. Therefore, focusing purely on these options would neither adequately satisfy the questions nor necessarily provide a logically coherent response."},{"question":"TEXT: it had to be something he learned at war ; he used the defense as another weapon like he 'd been doing it all his life . gisbourne charged him with flashing swordplay , their heavy swords clashing and spitting light in the winter sun . \`\` he 's impressive , '' eleanor murmured to me . i turned my head ; i had forgotten her . in the same look i saw isabel , gripping her chair , staring at","response":"Alright, kiddo.

It's impossible to say; The paragraph provided gives a brief overview of the film \\"Trainspotting,\\" including its release date, director, main cast members, and source of inspiration. However, it does not provide any information regarding the film's soundtrack. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude whether \\"Trainspotting\\" had a great soundtrack based solely on the information given. A film's soundtrack is an integral part of the overall viewing experience. It sets the tone and mood of different scenes, aids in narrative development, and can even become a commercial and critical success in its own right. In some instances, the soundtrack is so well-received it can outshine the film itself. However, the quality of a film's soundtrack can be determined by many factors, including but not limited to the quality of compositions, how well the music complements the film's tone and narrative, viewer's personal preferences, critical reception, and commercial success. In the case of \\"Trainspotting,\\" information about such factors is missing from the provided paragraph. Thus, without additional information, such as critical reviews, audience responses, or comparable metrics, it's impossible to make an informed opinion on the quality of the film's soundtrack.

When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors.

The state may not now enforce a requirement that all clinics in the state upgrade their facilities to be hospital-like surgical centers, even when they perform abortions only through the use of drugs, not surgery. And it may not enforce, against the clinics in McAllen and El Paso, a requirement that all doctors performing abortions have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within thirty miles of the clinic. That requirement can continue to be enforced elsewhere in Texas, the Court indicated. Those two provisions, together, had reduced the number of clinics still operating in the state to seven, with an eighth soon to open. At one time recently, Texas had forty-one clinics. The Supreme Court’s action Tuesday will allow the reopening of thirteen closed clinics on Wednesday, lawyers for the clinics said. The Court’s order will remain in effect while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rules on a constitutional challenge to the two measures. That court had previously upheld the admitting privileges requirement as it applied all across the state. Most recently, it had blocked a new ruling by a judge in Austin that seemed to invalidate the two provisions statewide. The Supreme Court gave no explanation for the four-sentence order. It noted that Justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas would have refused to delay any part of the state requirements. They did not give their reasoning. It would have taken the votes of five Justices to block the provisions, so it appears that at least that number from among the other six Justices voted for the result. The Justices voting for the order were not noted. In asking the Court to set aside, temporarily, the Fifth Circuit’s orders permitting enforcement of the two provisions, lawyers for the clinics had said that clinics closed as a result probably would not reopen unless those restrictions were lifted. They also contended that there had recently been an increase in the number of women seeking illegal abortions in areas where clinics could no longer provide services. The seven clinics that were not affected by the new restrictions (and the eighth that is soon to open) were concentrated in the four largest metropolitan areas in the eastern part of the state. The lawyers had told the Court that, for the time being, there were no licensed facilities to provide abortions anywhere in the state south or west of San Antonio — “an area larger than most states.” Texas officials had urged the Supreme Court not to block the new measures, arguing that they were necessary to protect the health of pregnant women in the state. They also argued that the challengers had exaggerated the practical impact of the new restrictions, and that most women would continue to have access to abortions within what they said was a reasonable driving distance. The Fifth Circuit, in allowing the restrictions to go into or remain in effect, had found that they would not impose an “undue burden” on a significant fraction of the women in the state who would need abortion services. The Supreme Court’s order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the new limitations, but is a strong indication that the state may have difficulty defending them, at least as statewide measures. The Court’s order marked the first time in the Justices’ new Term that the abortion controversy had returned. There may be other tests of the Court’s current view on that controversy later in the Term. Recommended Citation: Lyle Denniston, Court blocks abortion limits in Texas, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 14, 2014, 7:08 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/court-blocks-abortion-limits-in-texas/ ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state. In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades. The court also put on hold a separate provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges remains in effect elsewhere in Texas. Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects. The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year. But even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court said that it can be enforced in the meantime — opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 — and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again. Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced — including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems — shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas. Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas. Some other clinics, meanwhile, had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court. The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law. Critics call the measure a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions. Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion. Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","response":"The Supreme Court has barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its 2013 abortion restriction law, enabling the reopening of 13 clinics. One part of the law blocked requires all state clinics to upgrade their facilities to be like hospital surgical centers, even those that perform abortions purely through the use of drugs. The replacement of this law applies throughout the state. The other aspect cannot be enforced against clinics in McAllen and El Paso which specify that all doctors performing these operations have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. This second requirement can continue elsewhere in Texas. The Supreme Court's order is only temporary and will remain in place while the Fifth Circuit Court rules on a constitutional challenge to these measures. This decision is suggestive of potential difficulties for Texas in defending the laws as statewide measures."},{"question":"This is some data: Bionico, country, Mexico; Bionico, region, Jalisco; Dessert, dishVariation, Cake; Mexico, leader, Enrique Peña Nieto; Bionico, course, Dessert.

Specifically, this last step could involve the following actions: 1. Storage of purified water: Once the evaporated water has been condensed and collected, it should be stored in a clean and sterilized container to preserve its quality. The purified water can then be used for various purposes, such as drinking, cooking, irrigation, and industrial operations, depending on the intended application. 2. Storage and usage of separated salt: As the salt is left behind during the evaporation process, it should also be collected and stored properly, so as not to contaminate the environment. Depending on the quality and the properties of the salt, it could be utilized for various purposes, such as culinary use, animal feed, water softening, or even for industrial purposes like the production of chemicals and soaps. 3. Monitoring and maintenance: To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the process, it is crucial to monitor the performance of the equipment used, such as evaporators and condensers, and to carry out routine maintenance checks. This would ensure that the system is running optimally and avoids any potential downtime or contamination risks. 4. Environmental considerations: The process of water purification through evaporation can generate residual waste, such as brine, which contains high concentrations of salt and other impurities. It is essential to dispose of this waste in an environmentally sound manner, adhering to local regulations and guidelines. This may involve diluting the brine with water and discharging it into the sewer system or treating the waste for further beneficial use. 5. Documentation and record-keeping: Thorough documentation and record-keeping are essential for tracking the efficiency of the water purification process, as well as ensuring regulatory compliance. Records of key parameters, such as water inputs and outputs, salt production, and maintenance activities, should be accurately documented and stored securely. In conclusion, the last step of the process involves carefully managing the purified water and separated salt resulting from the evaporation and condensation cycle, ensuring proper storage and usage, as well as monitoring and maintaining the system for optimal performance. Additionally, proper waste disposal, adherence to environmental regulations, and thorough documentation and record-keeping are essential components of this final stage."},{"question":"Question: For a moment, Paul wasn't even sure who had walked into the room.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models.

Sentence 2: Kodak used enormous resources in the WTO case. Options are: -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze them step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the main subjects and information in both sentences. Sentence 1: Kodak, WTO case, putting energy into winning Sentence 2: Kodak, WTO case, using enormous resources Step 2: Compare the two subjects. Both sentences refer to Kodak and its involvement in the WTO case. Step 3: Compare the information provided about the subjects. Sentence 1 discusses the surprising aspect that Kodak put a lot of energy into winning the WTO case, more so than the fact that they lost. Sentence 2: This sentence underlines the usage of enormous resources by Kodak in the WTO case. Step 4: Determine if the information in the second sentence can be inferred from the first sentence. From the first sentence, we know that Kodak put a lot of energy into winning the case. This can be reasonably interpreted as Kodak using considerable resources and effort. Thus, we can infer that the second sentence is based on the information provided in the first sentence. Answer: Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him.

This championship victory marked the Royals' first title in 30 years; their previous World Series win occurred in 1985, when they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. The 2015 Royals roster was packed with talented players, such as first baseman Eric Hosmer, third baseman Mike Moustakas, center fielder Lorenzo Cain, and catcher Salvador Perez, who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. Manager Ned Yost led the team, and their bullpen included notable late-inning relievers Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis, and closer Greg Holland. Johnny Cueto and Yordano Ventura were among the starting pitchers who contributed to the Royals' successful season. Throughout the 2015 regular season, the Royals proved to be a formidable team, finishing with an impressive record of 95-67, which earned them the American League Central division title. In the American League Division Series (ALDS), Kansas City faced off against the Houston Astros, winning the series 3 games to 2. The Royals then advanced to the American League Championship Series (ALCS) to take on the Toronto Blue Jays, emerging victorious in six games and securing their place in the World Series. During the World Series showdown against the Mets, multiple pivotal moments played a role in the Royals' ultimate triumph. In Game 1, an inside-the-park home run by Alcides Escobar set the tone for a tightly contested matchup that lasted 14 innings. The Royals clinched the opener thanks to an RBI sacrifice fly by Hosmer. Games 2 and 4 both saw the Kansas City squad flexing their offensive capabilities, recording convincing 7-1 and 5-3 victories, respectively. Game 5, the series-clinching match, unfolded as a true baseball thriller. The Royals entered the ninth inning trailing the Mets by a score of 2-0.

His father, Niels Jørgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 øre and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances., what would be the answer ?

Over the course of an approximately 60-year career, he provided play-by-play for various sports on numerous radio and television networks, including NBC (1975-1999), CBS (2000-2014), and ESPN (2004-2011), as well for individual teams, such as UCLA Bruins basketball, Los Angeles Rams, California Angels and San Diego Padres. Enberg was well known for his signature on-air catchphrases \\"Touch 'em all\\" (for home runs) and \\"Oh, my!\\" (for particularly exciting and outstanding athletic plays). In the late 1960s, Enberg began a full-time sportscasting career in Los Angeles, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball). After every Angels victory, he would wrap up his broadcast with, \\"And the halo shines tonight,\\" in reference to the \\"Big A\\" scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium and the halo at the top, which would light up for everyone in the area to see, particularly from the adjacent freeway. Enberg was named California Sportscaster of the Year four times during this period. In the 1960s, Enberg announced boxing matches at L.A.'s Olympic Auditorium. In 1968, Enberg was recommended by UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan to be the national broadcaster for the syndicated TVS Television Network to cover the \\"Game of the Century\\" between the Houston Cougars, led by Elvin Hayes and the UCLA Bruins, led by Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The \\"Prime Time\\" nationally televised game demonstrated that college basketball had a national \\"Prime Time\\" audience and stands as a seminal contest in the evolution of nationally televised evening college basketball broadcasts. Enberg continued to call the occasional UCLA game for TVS through the early 1970s, usually teaming with Rod Hundley. In 1973, Enberg traveled to Beijing, China to host the groundbreaking TVS Television Network telecast of the USA vs. China basketball game. It was the first team sporting event ever played between China and the USA. In the 1970s, Enberg called the 1979 NCAA Championship game between Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson, and Indiana State, led by Larry Bird. He also hosted the syndicated television game show Sports Challenge, and co-produced the Emmy Award-winning sports-history series The Way It Was for PBS. In the 1970 opening conference game in Pauley Pavilion, Oregon went into a stall against the UCLA Bruins. Enberg had run out of statistics and began to fill his radio broadcast with small talk. The movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had just been released, and Enberg was humming the tune to \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\", but did not know the words. Two nights later, in a home game against Oregon State, many UCLA students brought the lyrics to the song. Enberg promised that he would sing the song if UCLA won the conference championship. He sang the song following the final game of the season. The event was recorded in the Los Angeles Times and was later recounted in the book Pauley Pavilion: College Basketball's Showplace by David Smale. During the 2006 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship broadcast, there was a short feature on the event. Did he have any signature phrases while working at the radio station in Los Angeles?","response":"Yes, Richard Enberg had signature phrases while working at the radio station in Los Angeles.

Depending on the situation, the phrase could imply one of the following scenarios: 1. Acquiring grass for a garden or landscape project: If the speaker is referring to obtaining natural grass or grass sod for enhancing their garden or other landscaping projects, the statement \\"Let's get some grass, we can get it about 2 blocks down from here\\" suggests that they know a nearby location, situated two blocks away, where they can readily purchase grass for these purposes. 2. Purchasing artificial grass for home or sports use: Artificial grass, also known as synthetic turf, is often used in residential homes as a low-maintenance alternative to natural grass or as an ideal playing surface for various sports. In this situation, the remark \\"Let's get some grass, we can get it about 2 blocks down from here\\" implies that the speaker is referring to a store or supplier within close proximity where they can obtain artificial grass. 3. Procuring grass as slang for marijuana: In certain contexts, the term \\"grass\\" may be used as slang for marijuana or cannabis. If this is the case, the statement \\"Let's get some grass, we can get it about 2 blocks down from here\\" would suggest that the speaker is aware of a nearby location where they can purchase marijuana. 4. Collecting grass for animal feed or bedding: In an agricultural or livestock-related context, the phrase \\"Let's get some grass\\" might refer to the process of collecting grass as feed or bedding for animals. Here, \\"Let's get some grass, we can get it about 2 blocks down from here\\" indicates that the speaker knows a suitable location just two blocks away where they can obtain the necessary grass for their animals. In conclusion, the exact meaning and intention behind the phrase \\"Let's get some grass\\" cannot be definitively determined without understanding the context in which it is used. In the scenario you provided, \\"Let's get some grass, we can get it about 2 blocks down from here,\\" the speaker is suggesting that they know a place nearby where they can acquire what they need, which could be grass for gardening, artificial grass, marijuana, or grass for animal feed or bedding. The context of the conversation and the relationship between the speaker and the listener would determine the precise meaning of this statement."},{"question":"14 yahweh's anger burned against moses, and he said, 'what about aaron, your brother, the levite? i know that he can speak well. also, behold, he comes out to meet you.

Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take actions that help to bring back the heart beat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information: the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on.[:] Options: A risky B shocking C exciting D boring Answer: A risky Question: Answer:","response":"Question: What type of situations may be encountered while giving first aid, as described in the article?

Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt.

Please answer step by step:","response":"While it's an interesting hypothetical scenario, the simple answer is no, Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot deadlift an adult black rhinoceros. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. Adult black rhinoceros weight: An adult black rhinoceros typically weighs between 1,800 to 3,100 pounds (800 to 1,400 kg), with male rhinos being heavier than females. 2. Arnold Schwarzenegger's deadlift capability: Arnold Schwarzenegger, despite being a legendary bodybuilder in his prime, has never been known for having a world-record deadlifting capability. The personal records for his deadlift are not well-documented, but top competitive powerlifters who specialize in deadlifting are capable of lifting well over 1,000 pounds (454 kg). 3. Deadlifting technique and record: Deadlifting involves lifting a loaded barbell from the ground to a standing position using your legs, back, and grip strength. The world record for a deadlift is over 1,100 pounds (500 kg) for men, still not enough to lift an adult black rhinoceros. 4. Arnold's current capability: Now in his 70s, Arnold Schwarzenegger is no longer in his bodybuilding prime, and it is highly unlikely that he could deadlift anywhere near his personal best, let alone lift an adult black rhinoceros. 5. Safety: Attempting to deadlift an adult black rhinoceros would pose enormous risks to both Arnold Schwarzenegger and the animal. Lifting a live animal this size would be both dangerous and unethical. In conclusion, while Arnold Schwarzenegger was an accomplished bodybuilder, deadlifting an adult black rhinoceros is far beyond his capabilities, as well as those of any human, due to the significant weight and safety concerns involved."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a hateful post in Bengali that expresses hate or encourages violence in a geopolitical context based on the protected characteristics such as race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.

It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of \\" style over substance\\" I couldn't disagree more. I believe that \\" Domino \\" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as \\"Crimson Tide\\" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. This was then carried through to \\" Enemy Of The State\\" and \\"Spy Game\\" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. \\" Man On Fire\\" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in \\" Domino\\" Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation \\" Domino\\" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have \\" traces of mescaline\\" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting. It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the \\"90210\\" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in \\" Domino\\" is in the surface and the surface is everything. I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work What is the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive. The reviewer enthusiastically praises \\"Domino\\" and its director, Tony Scott, arguing passionately against detractors who condemn the movie for its alleged superficiality and frenzied style. In the review, the author asserts that \\"Dominos\\" is not just an action movie, but a cinematically rich exploration of the main character's subjective experience, with highly intentioned stylistic and aesthetic choices. The reviewer highlights how Scott's changing stylistic techniques over different movies culminated in \\"Domino\\", creating a visual narrative that represents the disarrayed memories of the main character. Moreover, the reviewer admires how Scott, together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams, crafted a vivid depiction of contemporary American culture, evoking the loss of innocence through the journey of the underprivileged children in the movie. The reviewer implies that \\"Dominos\\" is similar to the works of Picasso or Pollock, where the surface, though not traditionally \\"realistic\\", is full of meaning and depth. Finally, the reviewer emotionally asserts their independent status, fervently stating their unwavering admiration for Tony Scott's work. Therefore, the reviewer not only provides their resounding endorsement for \\"Domino\\" but also expresses their deep respect for Tony Scott's career, viewing him as an avant-garde filmmaker whose visionary style elevates his movies into an expressionist art form on par with great paintings. Overall, the sentiment of this review is strongly supportive, appreciative, and adulatory."},{"question":"Triple: A Fortress of Grey Ice COUNTRY United States; United States ETHNIC_GROUP Native Americans in the United States What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"A big and strong fortress made of icy grey blocks is in a country called the United States, where Native American people live too."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a passage, further information available on a particular linked term from the statement, and a question.

Sinfray with letters to M. Bugros and Coja Wajid--which the latter afterwards made over to Clive--he continued his march to Patna, where he arrived on the 3rd of June, and was well received by Raja Ramnarain, and where he was within four or five days' march or sail from Sooty, the mouth of the Murshidabad or Cossimbazar river, and therefore in a position to join the Nawab whenever it might be necessary. In the mean time fate had avenged Law on one of his lesser enemies. This was that Ranjit Rai, who had insulted him during his interview with the Seths. The latter had pursued their old policy of inciting the English to make extravagant demands which they at the same time urged the Nawab to refuse. To justify one such demand, the English produced a letter in the handwriting of Ranjit Rai, purporting to be written at the dictation of the Seths under instructions from the Nawab. The latter denied the instructions, and the Seths promptly asserted that the whole letter was a forgery of their agent's. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","response":"A potential question that one might ask from this paragraph could be: \\"What were the events leading up to Law's arrival in Patna, and what consequences did his journey have on his relation with Raja Ramnarain and Nawab?\\" This question asks for detailed information on the strategic moves made by Law, the influence of other key figures like M. Sinfray, M. Bugros and Coja Wajid, the consequences of his continued march despite receiving recall orders, and the political intrigue involving Ranjit Rai and the Seths.

Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Durer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Durer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \\"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.\\" Question: \\"How many years passed between the first and final drafts of Durer's essay on aesthetics?\\" Answer: \\"16 years had passed since his first draft\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. 16 years passed between the first draft in 1512 and the final draft in 1528 of Durer's essay on aesthetics."},{"question":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: So many kids, so many stories. Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing. Question: Viewing social justice as \\"fighting to get your way\\" instead of doing the right thing means what, according to the narrator? Answer:","response":"According to the narrator, viewing social justice as \\"fighting to get your way\\" instead of doing the right thing is an inappropriate and faulty understanding of the concept. The narrator suggests that this perspective breeds a sense of entitlement and excuses, devalues personal responsibility, and undermines the actual purpose of social justice, which is to promote fairness, overcome challenges, and address societal inequalities."},{"question":"Is \\"After an interruption from St. Nicholas Park and City College, there is another small stretch of West 132nd Street between Broadway and Twelfth Avenue\\" a good answer to the question \\"There is a small stretch of what road between Broadway and Twelfth Avenue?\\"","response":"No, the original answer is not an ideal response to the question. A better, more detailed and longer response to the question \\"There is a small stretch of what road between Broadway and Twelfth Avenue?\\" would be: The small stretch of road between Broadway and Twelfth Avenue you are referring to is West 132nd Street. This street is located in the neighborhood of Harlem in the Northern part of Manhattan. It's important to know that this particular stretch of West 132nd Street is not continuous, as there's an interruption made by St. Nicholas Park and City College.

A:","response":"In order to assess whether \\"run for cover\\" is a valid answer for the question \\"What will Jesse want to do after taking a picture?\\", it's important to consider the context provided and evaluate how well the options align with the situation being described. The options given are: a) Yes b) No First, let's analyze the information provided about Jesse's actions: 1. Jesse climbed the mountain - This suggests a physical activity that demands a certain level of fitness and ability to handle the outdoors. 2. They took a picture at the peak - This implies that Jesse reached the top and chose to capture the moment with a photograph, which feels like a normal and reasonable thing to do in such a scenario. 3. They put the camera away - After taking the picture, Jesse stores their camera, an action that may indicate they were done with taking pictures for the moment. Based on this information alone, it's hard to conclude whether \\"run for cover\\" is a valid answer. There is no mention of any imminent danger or weather-related concerns that might warrant running for cover. Now, let us evaluate the provided answer options in relation to the question: a) Yes - If we choose \\"Yes,\\" we are suggesting that \\"run for cover\\" is a valid answer, implying there was some kind of threat or situation not explicitly mentioned that requires Jesse to seek cover. Although it's conceivable that something might happen that prompts Jesse to run for cover, such as a sudden change in weather or spotting a dangerous animal, there is not enough context to confidently make this assumption. b) No - If we choose \\"No,\\" we are suggesting that \\"run for cover\\" is not a valid answer and that there are other possible actions Jesse might take after capturing the photograph. Some alternatives could be continuing their hike, taking more pictures, or resting and enjoying the view. Based on the information provided, this option feels more reasonable since there is no indication of any imminent danger or threat to Jesse after taking the photograph. In conclusion, given the information provided in the question and the answer options, it seems more reasonable to assume that \\"run for cover\\" is not a valid answer to \\"What will Jesse want to do after taking a picture?\\" Therefore, the most suitable answer is option b) \\"No.\\" However, it is essential to note that without additional context or information about the situation or Jesse's preferences, the answer remains open to interpretation and further investigation."},{"question":"Q: Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30 percent, or approximately what? Choices: - 2-3 liters - 3-5 liters - 0-1 liters - 1-2 liters A: A:","response":"Blood volume indeed increases substantially during pregnancy. This is a crucial physiological change that occurs to accommodate the needs of the growing baby and to prepare the mother's body for childbirth. By the time of childbirth, the blood volume exceeds its preconception volume by approximately 30 percent. In terms of quantity, this increase corresponds to about 1-2 liters. So, the correct answer is: 1-2 liters. This increase in blood volume is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it ensures that there is adequate blood supply to the placenta, which is responsible for providing oxygen and essential nutrients to the fetus for optimal growth and development. Secondly, the increased blood volume enables the mother's body to handle the blood loss that occurs during childbirth. Thirdly, it helps maintain the mother's cardiovascular system, ensuring that both the mother and the fetus receive enough oxygen and nutrients through circulation. The body accomplishes this increase in blood volume by enhancing the production of red blood cells and plasma. The process begins early in the pregnancy and steadily progresses until it reaches its peak close to the time of childbirth. The blood volume then gradually returns to its pre-pregnancy levels after delivery, as the body eliminates the excess fluid through mechanisms such as sweating, urine output, and other physiological processes. In summary, the blood volume increase during pregnancy is critical for the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby. By the time of childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30 percent, which is approximately 1-2 liters. This adaptation ensures proper oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus and prepares the body for blood loss during delivery."},{"question":"Before the establishment of the Modern Greek state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios.

Which language is this?","response":"The language you have provided is Czech. Czech is the official language of the Czech Republic, it is also recognized as a minority language in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. It belongs to the family of Slavic languages and is similar to Slovak and, to a lesser extent, to Polish or Serbian. The Slavic languages, also known as the Slavonic languages, are Indo-European languages primarily spoken by the Slavic peoples or their descendants. They are thought to descend from a proto-language called Proto-Slavic, spoken during the Early Middle Ages, which in turn descends from the earlier Proto-Balto-Slavic language, linking the Slavic languages to the Baltic languages in a Balto-Slavic group within the Indo-European family. Czech is written in the Latin script with several other special characters like \\"é,ě, í, ř, š, ú, ů, ý, ž\\". The orthography of these characters includes diacritics, such as the acute accent, which extend the Latin script to accommodate the added graphemes. The accent mark over certain letters indicates a change in pronunciation, for example, an acute accent (čárka) signifies that the vowel is long (á, é, í, ó, ú, ý), and the ring (kroužek) above ů denotes an initial syllable u after a labial consonant and after b, also in compound words. In terms of grammar, like most Slavic languages, Czech's grammar encompasses a complex system of declension and conjugation. There are seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. This system applies to all nouns, pronouns, and adjective roots. Verbs are conjugated based on tense, mood, voice, and aspect. Czech vocabulary derives primarily from Proto-Slavic and Old Church Slavonic origins. Other words come from Latin, Greek, and Arabic, and modern words often come from English and French. It is estimated that 5% of words in the language are foreign. The Czech language has been used as a vehicle of literary expression since the 13th century, and there is a rich collection of Czech literature. Great works include those of authors like Franz Kafka and Milan Kundera, who have written many of their works in Czech. On a final note, the Czech language is known for its difficult pronunciation and complex grammar structure, but it is also widely admired for its beauty and poetic structures. It has been highly influential in the region and continues to make an impact in linguistic, historical, and cultural studies."},{"question":"The role of teacher is often formal and ongoing, carried out at a school or other place of formal education. In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college. These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching. Teachers, like other professionals, may have to continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development. Teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum. A teacher's role may vary among cultures. Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the arts, religion, civics, community roles, or life skills.

While it serves its purpose to some extent, the overall experience leaves a lot to be desired. Firstly, the user interface is very confusing and not at all user-friendly. It took me considerable time to navigate and fully understand the app's features. I think the developers need to invest some time in streamlining the process and making it more accessible to users. Secondly, the app's performance is very inconsistent. It crashes occasionally, resulting in lost data or unsaved progress, which is nothing short of frustrating. I also noticed an increase in battery consumption while using the app, an issue that should be addressed for a better user experience. Lastly, the app falls short in terms of features when comparing it to competing apps in the market. I was really hoping for some unique functionalities or innovative solutions, but this app just seems like a copy of what's already out there. In conclusion, com.google.android.gms didn't live up to my expectations and needs serious improvement. Considering its potential, the developers should work on enhancing the user interface, fixing the performance issues, and distinguishing the app from its competitors.

To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone. Vice President Erin Manning, Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired. To warn Naomi of this, she goes to Michael's home after not being able to reach Naomi and ends up leaking the information to him in the hope that he will be able to get her a promotion, something Naomi has been unable to do for her. Michael leaks the tips to his friends at Titanite and then sends the story to an old college roommate who is a tech journalist. Naomi figures out that it was Erin who betrayed her, based on her having a green pen, the same type of pen that Michael uses.

What is the answer??","response":"To solve the given equation for c, you need to isolate the c variable on one side of the equation. Let's start by breaking down the given equation: 57*c + 136 + 551 = 60 First, combine the constants: 136 + 551 = 687 So now the equation becomes: 57*c + 687 = 60 Now, to isolate the c variable, you should subtract 687 from both sides: 57*c + 687 - 687 = 60 - 687 57*c = -627 Next, to find the value of c, you divide both sides of the equation by 57: (57*c) / 57 = (-627) / 57 c = -11 So, the solution for the equation 57*c + 136 + 551 = 60 is c = -11."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 for k.","response":"To solve the equation -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 for k, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation The equation can be simplified by combining the constant terms: -2 + 19 = 17. So, the simplified equation is -17*k + 17 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate the variable k, we must get k on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side. In this case, we will move the +17 to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation. -17*k + 17 - 17 = 0 - 17 This simplifies to: -17*k = -17 Step 3: Solve for k Now we need to solve for k. Since k is being multiplied by -17, we must divide both sides of the equation by -17 to get k by itself. -17*k / -17 = -17 / -17 This simplifies to: k = 1 So the solution to the equation -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 is k = 1."},{"question":"Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions? Two villages are inhabited by lots of people that ride bicycles. Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days. Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","response":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions. The paragraph states that Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, which can create slippery conditions. This increases the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those who ride brakeless and have to brake through the drivetrain. Additionally, descending any significant gradient in Hill village can be more difficult due to the need for a fast spin or use of brakes to slow down.

His daily routine revolves around writing, reminiscing about his past adventures, and observing the daily life of the town through his window. Lately, Wilkins becomes intrigued by a young man named Kreeg, who moved in the house next door. Kreeg is an introverted, talented artist with an exceptional love for nature. He spends his time exploring the nearby woods, always returning with a sketchbook filled with breathtaking illustrations of the landscapes and creatures he discovers. Curious about the young man, Wilkins closely observes Kreeg's activities through his window and grows increasingly fond of him. Act 2: One day, Kreeg discovers an old buried chest in the woods, containing a beautifully crafted locket, a hand-drawn map, and a riddled poem inside. He shows the mysterious findings to Wilkins, as the pieces seem to be connected to Crestwood's long-forgotten history. The two set out to discover the historic secrets buried within their town and form an unlikely friendship in the process. As they decipher the ancient riddle, they unearth the tale of a lost civilization that once thrived in the area. It details a conflict between the people and a mythical creature, which led to the decline of the civilization. The map points to a hidden treasure in the form of a powerful artifact, rumored to have unimaginable power and guarded by the very same mythical creature.

Kreeg's unique artistic abilities help them uncover hidden symbols and messages amid the beauty of the landscape, making their way to the final destination. In the climax, they uncover an ancient hidden cavern where the treasure and the once-believed-to-be-mythical creature lie. With courage and wit, they confront the creature, and as they do, they come to understand its tragic backstory. They realize the creature was not a malevolent force but a guardian who had been wrongly accused by the bygone civilization, leading to its downfall. Wilkins and Kreeg work together and convince the creature to entrust them with the powerful artifact, promising to use it for the betterment of their town. Epilogue: Returning home, Wilkins and Kreeg choose to share the treasure with the community, using its legendary power to bring prosperity to Crestwood. The newfound connection between the two and their heroic actions help rediscover Crestwood's history and attract enthusiastic tourists, allowing the town to flourish like never before. In the end, Wilkins learns that life's greatest adventures come from unexpected friendships.

She recently got a medal and a promotion for her quick thinking when her plane did this. What might her plane have done? Possible A: danger, slow down, catch on fire, arrive late, carry freight Why is \\"catch on fire\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","response":"\\"Catch on fire\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it presents a plausible scenario where Jane's quick thinking, skills, and expertise as a pilot would be put to the test, and her actions could have been perceived as exemplary, meriting a medal and a promotion. Aircraft catching fire is a dangerous and unexpected emergency where rapid and correct decision-making is crucial. In-flight fires can be caused by various factors such as engine failure, electrical faults, or fuel leaks. As a pilot, Jane would have been responsible for the safety of the passengers, crew, and the aircraft itself. In such a high-pressure situation, she would have needed to maintain calm, assess the situation accurately, and take appropriate actions like activating fire suppression systems, coordinating with cabin crew, and possibly having to perform an emergency landing. In contrast, the alternative answers provided do not align as well with human common sense for receiving a medal and a promotion. While some situations, like \\"slow down\\" or \\"arrive late,\\" could have required quick thinking in specific scenarios, they generally are considered routine occurrences and not necessarily requiring exceptional skills or actions. Furthermore, options like \\"carry freight\\" do not pose any inherent challenges that would warrant recognition. In the event of a fire on an aircraft, a pilot like Jane may have exhibited exceptional situational awareness, decision-making, and communication skills with her crew (and air traffic control), successfully bringing the aircraft to safety and preventing loss of life or further damage. This extraordinary demonstration of bravery, professionalism, and adherence to standard procedures would be an incident where a pilot could be acknowledged and rewarded for their actions.

The trial of the suspects is internationally monitored, and key members of the extremist group are found guilty and sentenced to harsh prison terms. Iran and Yemen agree to work together to combat terrorism and extremism and improve diplomatic relations in the region, although tensions remain simmering beneath the surface. In the aftermath of these events, security measures are increased for diplomats and international personnel in volatile regions. The tragic death of Ali Asghar Asadi becomes a rallying point for nations to combat terrorism and work towards stability in the Middle East. Ultimately, Asadi's death leads to a united effort against violent extremism and promoting diplomacy instead of violence in the region."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Fact 1: The Himalayas were formed by rock folding. Fact 2: Folding and metamorphic rock Folding is caused by slow compression and the rock responds by bending. Given the two facts above, what caused the Himalayas to form? Answer:","response":"The formation of the Himalayas is a complex and fascinating geological process, which can be understood in conjunction with the two facts provided above. The cause behind the formation of this majestic mountain range can be linked to the theory of plate tectonics and the interactions between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Plate tectonics is a theory in Earth science that describes the large-scale motion and interaction of Earth's lithosphere, the outermost solid shell of our planet that is made up of the crust and the upper mantle. The lithosphere is fragmented into a number of mobile tectonic plates that are in constant motion, albeit at a very slow rate. These plates float on Earth's semi-fluid asthenosphere and move due to the convection currents generated by heat generated within Earth's interior. The formation of the Himalayas can be traced back to around 50 million years ago when the Indian Plate, which was part of the ancient continent Gondwana, began to move northwards and collided with the Eurasian Plate. This continental collision, known as the Indo-Asian Collision, initiated the formation of the Himalayas through a series of geological processes, including folding and the formation of metamorphic rocks. As stated in Fact 1, the Himalayas were formed by rock folding. Folding is a geological process wherein rocks bend and deform under immense pressure and stress, typically caused by the horizontal compression forces exerted during the collision of tectonic plates. In the case of the Himalayas, the immense pressure created during the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate led to the deformation and bending of the rock layers along the boundary. As the Indian Plate continued to push against the Eurasian Plate, layers of rock were squeezed, compressed, and bent, forming the folded mountain ranges that characterize the Himalayas. This process is still ongoing, as evidenced by the fact that the height of the Himalayas continues to increase each year. Folding and the formation of metamorphic rock, as mentioned in Fact 2, are closely related processes. Metamorphic rock forms when pre-existing rock undergoes changes in response to variations in temperature, pressure, or chemical conditions. During the formation of the Himalayas, the intense stress and pressure experienced by the rocks at the boundary of the colliding plates were sufficient to induce metamorphism. As the rocks bent and deformed, they were also transformed into metamorphic rocks like gneiss, schist, and marble, which can be found throughout the Himalayan range today. In conclusion, the formation of the Himalayas was driven by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate during the process of plate tectonics. This continental collision led to folding and deformation of the rocks along the plate boundary due to immense pressure and stress, as well as the formation of metamorphic rocks. The continuous movement and interaction between these tectonic plates mean that the Himalayas are still undergoing these geological processes and continue to evolve over time."},{"question":"Sentence 1: The victory secured independence from Spain.

As they set off in their family car, Timmy could hardly contain his excitement, giggling and squirming in his seat. When they finally arrived, Timmy's eyes grew wide as he saw the gigantic Ferris wheel and the colorful carousel. Timmy's family spent the entire day at Paragon Park, exploring every corner and trying out all the fun activities. Timmy laughed his way through the spinning tea cups and clapped his hands with delight when he won a huge stuffed bear at one of the game booths. Timmy's favorite part of the day was the ice cream treat his mom bought him from a little ice cream cart. The sun was shining brightly, and the cold, sweet ice cream melted as it ran down his hand. Timmy couldn't stop giggling as he licked his hand to catch the drips. As the sun began to set, Timmy's family gathered to watch the beautiful fireworks display. Timmy's eyes sparkled as the colors exploded in the sky, and he imagined that they were surrounded by a rainbow of shimmering stars. Timmy went to sleep that night with a smile on his face, so grateful for the amazing day at Paragon Park.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Here's a step-by-step process to create such a task: 1. Identify the key aspects of physical reasoning: Consider the essential skills you want to assess, such as understanding of gravity, force, inertia, friction, or other physical laws. 2. Create a realistic scenario: Develop a relatable, real-life situation that engages the test-taker and requires the application of physical reasoning to solve. This can be in the form of a puzzle, a mechanical challenge, or a practical problem. 3. Develop a clear objective: State the goal of the task in a concise manner, ensuring that it can be easily understood by the test-taker. 4. Plan a step-by-step solution: Break down the problem-solving process into smaller steps, focusing on the physical reasoning aspects. This will allow you to ensure that the task focuses on the intended aspects and can be solved using the person's understanding of the physical world. 5. Add constraints or limitations: Incorporate factors that may restrict the solution, such as time limitations or limited resources, to challenge the test-taker's problem-solving skills further. 6. Ensure the task is fair and unbiased: Make sure the task does not require specific cultural knowledge or personal experiences, to avoid any bias that may impact the test-taker's performance. 7. Test the task: Before using the task to assess someone's ability to perform physical reasoning, try it out yourself or with others to ensure it is engaging, challenging, and solvable using physical reasoning skills. An example of a task to test someone's physical reasoning abilities could be: Objective: Design a device that can safely transport a raw egg from the top of a 10-meter tall building to the ground without breaking it. Constraints: The device can be constructed using only household materials, such as cardboard, rubber bands, balloons, and tape. Steps: 1. Understand the properties at play: Consider the forces acting on the egg (gravity), the potential impact when it reaches the ground (force), and how these forces may cause the egg to break (fragility of the eggshell). 2. Brainstorm ideas for the device design: Identify potential mechanisms to absorb or distribute the impact force, such as cushioning materials or a design that slows down the descent (using air resistance). 3. Select the most promising idea: Analyze the concepts and choose the one with the best use of available materials and the greatest chance of success. 4. Construct the device: Build the device, taking care to ensure it provides adequate protection for the egg and meets the constraints set by the task. 5. Test the performance of the device: Use a simulation or perform the actual task by dropping the device from the required height. Observe the results and evaluate the success of the device in protecting the egg. In conclusion, a task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning should include a clear objective, a realistic scenario, and a focus on the application of physical principles to solve the problem. The task should be fair, engaging, and challenging, providing a suitable test of the individual's understanding of the physical world and their ability to apply logical reasoning in a practical context."},{"question":"Don't have a patio?

Sightings of these testimonies continue to emerge as grieving parents have now come forward to the BBC to recount their heartbreaking experiences, which on many occasions remain unaddressed by the concerned authorities. Step 1: Research the Shropshire baby ashes scandal In order to write an informative article, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the Shropshire baby ashes scandal. The scandal, exposed by a local newspaper in 2013, centers around the cremation of babies in Shropshire, England, where parents were left with no ashes of their deceased children. This issue has highlighted deficiencies in the practices at the crematorium and raised questions about the treatment of grieving families. Step 2: Gather testimonies from grieving parents Contacting the BBC would be crucial to gather relevant information for the article. The first-hand experience of parents can provide insight into the gravity of the situation and the impact it has on them. These testimonials can reveal the practices followed in different areas and the extent of negligence on the part of the responsible entities.

Questions regarding the restitution process, actions against personnel involved, and any proposed changes in legislation would be important aspects to explore. Step 4: Address the emotional and psychological impact The emotional toll on parents who have not received their baby's ashes is immeasurable. The article should delve into the psychological effects experienced by grieving parents and mention any support mechanisms and resources that could be helpful for them in coping with their loss. Step 5: Propose possible solutions and accountability measures As the article comes to a close, it should discuss potential solutions and accountability measures that can be taken to address the issue both on a local and national level. This could include better transparency during cremation procedures, the establishment of clear guidelines for the crematorium staff, and stricter adherence to legal and ethical practices. Conclusion: The Shropshire baby ashes scandal has exposed a deeply distressing issue faced by grieving parents, who have not received the ashes of their deceased children. Grieving parents' testimonies shared with the BBC have highlighted the need for increased transparency, strict adherence to legal and ethical practices, and the importance of providing adequate support for bereaved families.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What increases blood flow to the body's surface?\\" is \\"Blood vessels widen\\"?","response":"Yes, that's right! When blood vessels in the skin widen, or dilate, it increases blood flow to the body's surface, and this helps us to stay cool by letting more heat escape from our body.

The premise suggests that the callers made multiple attempts to establish contact, but there was no response, which implies that the act of ringing either a phone or a doorbell was met with silence or a lack of engagement from the other side. The phrase \\"no sign of life\\" further reinforces this idea, as it often refers to the complete absence of activity or response within a given context.

Diffusion occurs slower in water or oxygen.? A:","response":"A: The process you are referring to is known as diffusion, which is the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, eventually leading to an even distribution of particles. This process occurs more rapidly in gases compared to liquids due to the larger spaces between gas particles, which allows them to move more freely and quickly. In contrast, diffusion occurs at a slower pace in liquids, like water or oxygen (in its liquid state), because the particles are closer together and thus have less freedom to move."},{"question":"Maailmanlaajuisesti on jo menetetty 200 000 alaan välittömästi sidoksissa olevaa työpaikkaa, joista 30 000 yksinomaan EU:ssa, ja tämä on vain jäävuoren huippu.

Hello, little buddy! Today, we are going to talk about a football player, specifically, a quarterback who lost two fumbles. Now, you must be wondering what a quarterback and a fumble are, right? No worries! I'll explain everything, so let's begin. In a football game, teams have different players with different jobs. One of these players is called a \\"quarterback.\\" This player is super important! They're like the leader of the team's offense, and they run the plays that help the team score points. The \\"offense\\" is when a team has the ball and is trying to score. The quarterback is the one who throws the ball or gives it to another player who will run with it. Now, a \\"fumble\\" is when a player holding the ball accidentally drops or loses it. This is not good, because the other team can pick up the ball and try to score! So, fumbles are bad, and players try their best to avoid them. So, back to our question: which quarterback lost two fumbles? Well, many quarterbacks have lost two fumbles in a game, throughout football's history. We would need more information to know exactly which quarterback you are asking about. It could be a famous professional player or someone playing in a local game. In the future, if you want to know about a specific game or player, just let me know! I'll be here to help you with any questions you have. But remember, even though fumbles are not good, players are human, and mistakes happen. The most important thing is that the quarterback keeps trying their best!"},{"question":"Genome: Both the number of base pairs and the number of genes vary widely from one species to another, and there is only a rough correlation between the two (an observation known as the C-value paradox).

You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Input: Ben (Robert De Niro), a veteran Hollywood producer, is suffering a number of professional and personal problems. His latest film, Fiercely, has a disastrous test screening, mostly because of its ending which features the murder of its main character (played by Sean Penn, who plays himself elsewhere in the film) along with his pet dog.Ben and his maverick British director, Jeremy Brunell (Michael Wincott), plead their case to studio executive Lou Tarnow (Catherine Keener). She accuses Ben of filming the dog's killing only so he could use it as a \\"bargaining chip\\" - to make it easier to negotiate against cutting other problematic scenes). Lou threatens to pull Ben's movie from Cannes and take over editing unless at least the dog's death is removed. Jeremy adamantly refuses, throwing a tantrum.Adding to Ben's problems, he is having trouble making a clean break from Kelly, his second wife. Ben later discovers his wife is having an affair with Scott Solomon, a married screenwriter who Ben has previously worked with. Scott has a screenplay that he's trying to get off the ground, to which Brad Pitt later becomes attached.Lastly the studio is threatening to cancel a planned Bruce Willis movie because of the star's unwillingness to shave the large, thick beard that he has grown. Ben's career hinges on the fate of the film, but any attempt to reason with Willis inevitably meets a violent, foul-mouthed response.Ultimately Jeremy relents and re-edits the ending of Fiercely to have the dog survive. Ben tries to get Willis's agent, Dick Bell, to reason with him and get the beard removed, but his efforts only get Ben fired. Nonetheless, Willis does eventually shave his beard off, and the film goes ahead.A week later, Ben, Lou and Jeremy attend Cannes, hopeful that they might take a Palme D'Or award. Unfortunately, and without telling Ben or Lou, Jeremy has re-edited Fiercely again, not only killing the dog, but adding nearly a full minute of bullets being shot into their bodies. While the new ending destroys the film's chances of a Palme d'Or and angers many in the audience, others eagerly applaud the final version of the film, including Sean Penn (playing himself). Lou is not impressed, and immediately flies out of Cannes on the studio's private jet, leaving Ben stranded in France.Ben eventually does make it back home, in time for a photo-shoot of Hollywood's top thirty producers with Vanity Fair, although after the magazine's publishers hear about the debacle in Cannes, Ben is relegated to the far edge of the photo, meaning he will be barely noticeable., Question: Who re-edited the film?

When a tiger sees an animal, it moves quickly and then jumps on the animals to kill it. Sometimes it can take the tiger several days to finish eating its food. When the tiger is full, it will cover the dead animal with leaves. Later, when the tiger is hungry again, it comes back to eat some more. Tigers are different from others in the cat family: they like water and often jump into rivers to swim. Some tigers live in very cold places in North Korea, Russia and China. Other tigers live in warmer places--in India and parts of Southeast Asia. But now all tigers are in danger. Some people kill tigers to use their skins for clothes, and their bodies for medicine. There is also less and less land for tigers to live in. ,. Which of the following is NOT true? A) Tigers usually go out to look for food at night. B) The tiger can kill a big animal very quickly. C) The tiger covers the dead animal with leaves if it can't eat it up. D) Tigers like to hunt for food in small groups. Answer:","response":"D) Tigers like to hunt for food in small groups. Tigers are known as solitary hunters, meaning they prefer to hunt alone rather than in groups. While some big cats, such as lions, are known for their social behavior and hunt cooperatively in prides, tigers do not typically exhibit this behavior. Tigers rely on stealth and surprise to catch their prey, and hunting alone allows them to be more efficient in their approach. They have excellent night vision and often use the cover of darkness to stalk their prey. Once they have chosen a target, they move quietly and quickly, using their powerful hind legs to leap onto the animal and deliver a fatal bite. When a tiger has successfully hunted and killed an animal, it may take several days for it to fully consume its prey. In the meantime, they will cover the carcass with leaves or other vegetation to hide it from scavengers. This allows the tiger to return to the food source when it is hungry again, ensuring that it can make the most of its successful hunt. Tigers are known for their affinity for water, and are excellent swimmers. They can often be found around rivers or other water sources, and are not averse to diving in or swimming across to reach their prey or cool off. As mentioned in the passage, tigers can be found in various climates and environments, from the cold forests of North Korea, Russia, and China, to the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, tigers face numerous threats to their existence, including habitat loss and poaching for their skins and body parts. Conservation efforts are critically important in order to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival for future generations."},{"question":"As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What requirements was Al Qaeda able to meet by spring and summer of 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Bombs, guns, personnel etc\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","response":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane, later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super-baby named Kahuna who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives.

According to Archie, Kahuna rescued a group of children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. Kahuna and Kane are nemeses and hate each other, but Kahuna always wins their battles. Archie's father Stan, who seems to own the day care centre, is letting it be used as a television set by the evil Biscane (yes, in other words, Kane) who is starting up his own TV channel. Archie notices someone spying on the goings-on at the television set in the bushes, but he isn't sure who it is. However, he begins to believe Biscane is evil.

Who are the most famous gigolos in the world today? This question is specifically asking about the most well-known gigolos who are active and prominent in today's society. This means the answer would only include those who are considered famous at the present time and excludes any historical examples of famous gigolos from the past. The emphasis here is on the most relevant and contemporary individuals within the field. 2. Who are the most famous gigolos in history or in the world today? This question broadens the scope of the inquiry by also including famous gigolos from throughout history.

The initial question's emphasis remains on the current context, whereas the latter question attempts to produce a more exhaustive interpretation of the most famous gigolos in both history and the present."},{"question":"To think there are some people who still argue that the law shouldn't categorize some offenses as hate crimes and allow for enhanced criminal penalties. They claim that all sorts of crimes are motivated by hate, and to separate some from others elevates some victims over others and amounts to the state policing thoughts and feelings. They also fear that politicians and institutions are simply yielding to political correctness, liberal pressure groups and identity politics. My view is that hate crimes deserve special punishment because they don't just victimize whoever they're aimed at; they're intended to send a message, and they terrorize the whole society. That debate might have been settled Wednesday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, where hate was on display. A shooting left one man dead: Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff who, according to museum director Sara Bloomfield, \\"died heroically in the line of duty.\\" The alleged assailant is James von Brunn, a Holocaust denier who created an anti-Semitic Web site. The 88-year-old often challenged the authenticity of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" the book about a teenage girl living in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. So it was probably no coincidence that the shooting occurred on the same day the museum had scheduled a play based on a fictional meeting between Anne Frank and Emmett Till, a martyr of the civil rights movement. Von Brunn also had longstanding ties to white supremacist groups, according to authorities. These outfits flourish in bad times because they give underperformers something really valuable: convenient scapegoats for their troubles, failures and shortcomings. Without that, these misfits might actually have to look in the mirror and take responsibility for their own lives. Although these groups are properly categorized as \\"hate groups\\" by organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, what also fuels them are things like fear and insecurity. Nowadays, their targets are often Latinos, especially immigrants. But, before that and for much of the history of this country, the targets have been African-Americans. And, for much of the history of the world, they have been Jews. And that prejudice hasn't gone away. Consider what the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the former Chicago, Illinois, pastor whose relationship with Barack Obama became an issue in the presidential election, recently told the Virginia newspaper, the Daily Press, when asked if he speaks to Obama. \\"Them Jews aren't going to let him talk to me,\\" Wright said in an apparent reference to some of Obama's aides. Wright later said he misspoke and meant to refer to \\"Zionists.\\" A researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center has said her group had a thick file on von Brunn going back 20 years and that he had become a \\"hardcore neo-Nazi.\\" Von Brunn blamed a six-year prison term he once served -- for the attempted kidnapping of Federal Reserve board members in 1981 -- on \\"a Negro jury,\\" \\"Jew/Negro attorneys\\" and \\"a Jew judge,\\" according to his Web site. In documents read at trial, von Brunn wrote that his goal was to \\"deport all Jews and blacks from the white nations.\\" Also, on his Web site, there's a message lamenting how \\"bit by bit government institutions and Congressmen fell into JEW hands -- then U.S. diplomacy, businesses, resources and manpower came under Jew control.\\" You get the picture. It's no mystery what this guy is, to anyone but himself. His court-appointed lawyer from the Federal Reserve case said von Brunn, a veteran, considers himself a patriot. He's no such thing. That concept is best defined as love for one's country, not hatred for everyone else. It's also obvious that, while Americans are always in a hurry to close our most unpleasant chapters, anti-Semitism is alive and well in parts of our society. Like its equally vile cousins -- racism and nativism -- it thrives because many people are threatened by change and eager to cast others as villains. Meanwhile, President Obama said the museum shooting \\"reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms.\\" So true, Mr. President. Here's to vigilance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"Hate crimes deserve special punishment because they don't just victimize whoever they're aimed at; they're intended to send a message, and they terrorize the whole society. Enhancing criminal penalties for hate crimes acknowledges that these offenses have wider societal impacts and deters individuals from engaging in such targeted violence. While some argue that categorizing hate crimes elevates certain victims over others, the purpose of these laws is to recognize the unique and harmful nature of these crimes. Furthermore, hate crimes are committed based on prejudice and are often fueled by fear and insecurity. Hate groups flourish in bad times, providing underachievers with scapegoats for their troubles, failures, and shortcomings. Most hate crimes are motivated by racial, ethnic, or religious animosity, and have deep historical roots. Doing away with the distinction and legal framework for hate crimes would lessen the focus on addressing the root causes of these offenses and tackling the difficult issue of prejudice. Anti-Semitism, racism, and nativism are not relegated to the past but continue to manifest in contemporary society. Individuals like James von Brunn, the Holocaust denier allegedly responsible for the shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, demonstrate the dangerous consequences of unchecked hate. President Obama's call for vigilance against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms emphasizes the need to use enhanced criminal penalties as an essential tool against hate crimes. Ultimately, categorizing offenses as hate crimes and allowing for enhanced criminal penalties is an essential part of maintaining a just and inclusive society. These measures not only protect vulnerable individuals and communities but also discourage the continued proliferation of harmful prejudice and animosity."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who walked towards music he heard from another room at a party?

This synopsis contains spoilers from the movie!!At the start of the movie, we see the main protagonist Peter Hadley(Jeremy Strong) listening to a woman(Fairuza Balk) talk about her recent experience of having her fourth abortion. She talks about how she came home from the clinic and how she lives out in the middle of nowhere but her boyfriend, who hears everything, heard her come home. He went in to her room to see her and she tried to pretend she was asleep but she couldn't hold it in. She said she started to cry and she regrets that she did it and how she wishes her baby was still inside of her alive. She also claims that she wants to kill herself and how whenever she makes love she can't \\"feel anything \\". As the camera zooms out we see that Peter is really a medical student trying to take an exam in front of his teachers and other medical students. We also realize that the woman speaking about her recent abortion is just an actress playing the role of a depressed woman who's had four abortions. After her speech, Peter is supposed to say something about her diagnosis and what he recommends she should do, but Peter gets lost in the story and becomes just as depressed as the role she is playing for the exam. Finally, he looks over his clipboard and says that prescription Paxil is right for her. After that his teacher asks him if there is anything else but Peter just looks nervous and unsure of himself and remains silent. Then his teacher gets up to the podium and sarcastically says, \\"Paxil. Really??\\" He then calls the next student up to take her exam. We then see the opening title of the movie \\"Humboldt County\\", while we see Peter walking down the hall of the medical school with his hands in his pockets. The camera then cuts to him sitting down with his arms on his knees looking even more nervous and depressed than before. The actress who was playing the depressed woman then comes out of his teachers office and tells him that he says Peter can go in now. Peter says thanks to her and she notices he...

Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do. Many people still prefer washing dishes by hand to machine washing because _ . A) hand - washed dishes are cleaner B) washing dishes by hand is cheaper C) dishwashers are not so easily handled D) some dishes cannot be machine washed Answer:","response":"A) hand - washed dishes are cleaner"},{"question":"Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What were the full names of the two people who died in prison? is inside the article: Other scholar-bureaucrats were wary of Wang's heterodoxy, the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office, and his overall socially rebellious message. To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court., can you guess it ?

România, ca orice altă țară, este într-adevăr confruntată cu numeroase provocări serioase care afectează diferite aspecte ale societății. În primul rând, să examinăm unele dintre cele mai pregnante probleme cu care se confruntă România în prezent: 1. Economie: Economia românească este în continuă creștere și dezvoltare, dar avansează încet comparativ cu alte țări din Uniunea Europeană. Problemele care afectează economia includ nivelurile ridicate ale datoriei publice, infrastructura slabă și corupția. 2. Educație: Sectorul educației este încă afectat de subfinanțare și lipsa resurselor, ceea ce duce la rezultate slabe ale elevilor și scăderea calității învățământului. 3. Sănătate: Sistemul de sănătate românesc se confruntă cu provocări majore, cum ar fi lipsa personalului medical, lipsa echipamentelor și resurselor necesare pentru oferirea unei îngrijiri medicale adecvate, precum și corupția la nivel înalt. 4. Mediu: Poluarea și degradarea mediului sunt probleme grave în România, având în vedere ratele ridicate de emisii de gaz cu efect de seră, tăierile ilegale de păduri și problemele legate de calitatea apei. 5. Corupție și guvernanță: România continuă să lupte cu corupția la toate nivelurile guvernamentale, conducând la o gestionare ineficientă și lipsirea de încredere a cetățenilor în instituții. Eforturile de eradicare a corupției, întreprinse pe plan național și în colaborare cu alte țări și organizații internaționale, încă sunt în desfășurare. 6. Demografie și migrație: Populația României este în scădere din cauza ratei reduse a natalității, a îmbătrânirii populației și a emigrației forței de muncă, în special către țări din Europa de Vest cu economii mai dezvoltate. Aceasta provoacă lipsa forței de muncă și pune presiune pe finanțele publice. 7. Justiție socială: Inechitatea de venit, sărăcia și excluziunea socială afectează o mare parte din populația României, în special în zonele rurale și în rândul comunităților marginalizate, precum romii. 8. Securitate internă și externă: România își consolidează securitatea internă și externă, în special în contextul relațiilor dificile cu vecinii săi, Rusia și Republica Moldova, și al rolului său în NATO. Aceste provocări demonstrează amploarea problemelor pe care România trebuie să le abordeze pentru a asigura o dezvoltare armonioasă și durabilă a țării. Cu toate acestea, potențialul pentru schimbări pozitive există și se întrevede prin eforturile crescânde ale societății civile, ale guvernului și ale actorilor internaționali de a le aborda într-o manieră concertată și eficientă."},{"question":"Given the question: Article: Who's in control of your life? Who is pulling your string? For the majority of us, it's other people - society, colleagues, friends, family or our religious community. We learned this way of operating when we were very young, of course.We were brainwashed.We discovered that feeling important and feeling accepted was a nice experience and so we learned to do everything we could to make other people like us.As Oscar Wilde puts it,\\"Most people are other people.Their thoughts are someone else's opinions,their lives a mimicry ,their passions a quotation.\\" So when people tell us how wonderful we are,it makes us feel good.We long for this good feeling like a drug--we are addicted to it and seek it out wherever we can.Therefore,we are so eager for the approval of others that we live unhappy and limited lives,failing to do the things we really want to.Just as drug addicts and alcoholics live worsened lives to keep getting their fix ,we worsen our own existence to get our own constant fix of approval. But just as with any drug,there is a price to pay.The price of the approval drug is freedom--the freedom to be ourselves. The truth is that we cannot control what other people think.People have their own schedule,and they come with their own baggage and,in the end,they're more interested in themselves than in you.Furthermore,if we try to live by the opinions of others,we will build our life on sinking sand.Everyone has a different way of thinking,and people change their opinions all the time.The person who tries to please everyone will only end up getting exhausted and probably pleasing no one in the process.

Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle. Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner.

Premise 1: \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive.\\" This statement describes a specific scenario in which a young Asian man is seated behind a chessboard, presumably prepared for a match, and waiting for his opponent to join him. The context of this statement is limited to the chessboard, the young Asian man, and the impending arrival of another player. The location where this situation takes place is not explicitly mentioned.

Again, the context of this statement is limited to the young man and the planet Mars. There is no mention of an Asian background or his involvement in any activities, such as playing chess. Furthermore, Mars' involvement suggests a potentially futuristic or hypothetical setting since no human has set foot on Mars yet in reality.

Therefore, it would be inappropriate to automatically assume that the young man on Mars is, in fact, the same young Asian man waiting behind the chessboard. Given the limited information provided in both premises and the lack of apparent connection between them, one cannot conclude that premise 1 is true if premise 2 is true. It is vital to establish a connecting link between the young Asian man behind the chessboard and the young man on Mars before considering whether the two statements can hold true simultaneously. Such a link could involve specifying if there is chess playing involved on Mars or further identifying the location of the chess match mentioned in the first premise. In conclusion, based on the provided information and the lack of connections between both premises, it cannot be definitively concluded whether \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive\\" is true if \\"A young man is on Mars.\\" More information or context is necessary to establish a connection between the two situations and hence reach a valid conclusión."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If your dog or cat is eating grass, it means it's going to rain. False maybe. There' s no evidence that when a dog or cat is eating grass in the front yard, it' s going to rain. But then, there's no evidence that it isn't going to rain, either. Doctors think dogs and cats eat grass to help make their stomach better or maybe just because they like the taste of it. You'll get sick if you go outside in cold weather with wet hair. False. You might feel cold, but you can't catch a cold because you were outside with wet hair. Many churches have prevented people from throwing rice at weddings because the rice grows larger in a bird's stomach when eaten, causing the bird to explode . True and false. It's true many churches have prevented people from throwing rice, but this is more likely because the rice can become slick on a road or street. There's nothing about rice that will hurt birds. Rice is an important part of many bird's food. Chocolate is Poisonous to dogs. True. Chocolate has theobromine, which can make your dog sick.

If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage.

When a quarter's time runs out and the ball is still being played, the quarter will keep going until the ball is no longer in play. This is called extending the quarter.

This particular case raises concerns about railway safety, as it is part of a broader pattern of unsafe behavior at this specific location. Over the past year and a half, a total of 18 similar incidents have been recorded at Ducketts crossing. Network Rail, the authority responsible for the operation and maintenance of the railway infrastructure in the United Kingdom, issued a statement highlighting the potentially \\"life-changing consequences\\" of ignoring railway safety procedures. This serves as a stark reminder to the public to exercise caution and adhere to the safety guidelines designed to protect them around trains and railway tracks. As 18 incidents have occurred within a span of 18 months at the same crossing, the article also implicitly suggests that there may be a need to reevaluate the safety measures in place at this particular location. This could include exploring options such as improved warning systems, educational campaigns to raise awareness of the danger, or even structural changes to the crossing itself to better ensure the safety of the public. In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of railway safety and the potentially devastating consequences of ignoring warning signals at railway crossings. With a concerning number of similar incidents happening at the Ducketts crossing, it underscores the need for a proactive approach to addressing the situation, which may involve reviewing and enhancing the safety measures in place to protect passersby and prevent further accidents."},{"question":"Instructions: You will be given a sentence that describes a restaurant.

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.\\" Answer: A:","response":"Whitehall initiated the replacement of Dowding due to their disquiet at the failures of the RAF."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Ronald Belford \\"Bon\\" Scott (9 July 1946 19 February 1980) was a Scottish-born Australian rock musician, best known for being the lead singer and lyricist of Australian hard rock band AC/DC from 1974 until his death in 1980. - The iron maiden was a torture and execution device, consisting of an iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior, sufficiently tall to enclose a human being.

Complete the following sentence. Lynn proposed she should get the cat and he the dog in the divorce. She had a tighter bond with the","response":"Lynn proposed she should get the cat and he the dog in the divorce. She had a tighter bond with the cat, as she had raised it from a kitten and spent countless hours nurturing, playing with, and taking care of it. Conversely, her husband had a stronger connection with the dog, which they had adopted later in their relationship. The decision to split the beloved pets in this manner was rooted in their distinct characteristics, preferences, and emotional attachments to the animals. From the moment Lynn had brought home the tiny, fragile kitten, she had taken it under her wing. Deeply empathetic and compassionate, she gave the cat everything it needed to thrive, from proper nutrition and healthcare to affectionate cuddles and interactive playtime. As the years went by, the cat developed a unique bond with Lynn, often curling up by her side during rest and seeking her warmth and comfort during the cold winter months. As a result of this close connection, the cat had become a significant source of emotional support and companionship for Lynn. On the other hand, Lynn's husband was deeply passionate about dogs and spent his spare time volunteering at local animal shelters. This provided him with ample opportunities to interact with various types of dogs, affording him the ability to hone both his knowledge of their behaviour and his skills in training and discipline. When they decided to adopt a dog together as a family, he played a crucial role in the dog's upbringing and training, while Lynn took a more peripheral role. The dog, sensing his unwavering dedication and strong presence, formed an unbreakable bond with him. Over time, their pets became carefully entwined in their personal lives, reflecting the love they had poured into them and fulfilling different emotional needs for each spouse. The cat's quiet, intuitive nature resonated with Lynn's introverted and contemplative personality, while the dog's loyalty and exuberance melded seamlessly with her husband's outgoing and adventurous spirit. Facing the unfortunate reality of the divorce, Lynn and her husband realized that the best choice for both the pets and themselves was to separate the animals based on their strongest connections. This way, they ensured that neither Lynn nor her husband would be left without the comforting presence of their furry friends during a difficult time. In addition, creating a clear and fair distribution of their beloved pets would enable the couple to avoid any possible disputes over ownership, letting the cat continue to benefit from the deep bond with Lynn and the dog to thrive under her husband's engaged care and guidance. Ultimately, by prioritizing the well-being and emotional health of both humans and animals alike, Lynn and her husband hoped that the decision to split their pets in the divorce would allow all parties involved to maintain a sense of stability and support in the challenging days ahead."},{"question":"Archie Wilson (footballer) - Archie Wilson (born 25 August 1888) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

The first statement shows that she does care for someone else. This directly contradicts the second statement which asserts that she doesn't care about anyone. 2.

Competitors on May The Best House Win – the popular Channel 4 programme in which four houseproud people judge one another’s homes – generally abide by an unwritten rule. It states that when the show is over, all agree it was a fair contest and the winners deserve the £1,000 prize. But nothing would persuade Robert and Lisa Foden, from near Warrington in Cheshire, to agree. Lisa, 34, who appeared on the show on May 20 last year, says they lost only because ‘the two people who won gave everyone else rubbish marks’. This may sound like sour grapes, but given the effort and ingenuity that went into the couple’s extraordinary Bond-themed home, filled with high-tech luxuries 007 would be proud of, their angst is understandable.","response":"For months after the show's airing, the Foden couple could not shake the feeling of being unfairly judged by their fellow competitors. Their sleek, modern, and tech-savvy home, designed around the iconic James Bond theme, was certainly a cut above the rest. However, they couldn't shake the nagging feeling that there was more to the judging than met the eye. For weeks, the Fodens analyzed the episodes that preceded theirs and found a pattern. In each episode, a specific couple would give extremely low scores to their competitors, resulting in the couple becoming the show's victors. These findings fueled Lisa and Robert's search for the truth. They decided that the only way to clear their conscience and expose the accused couple's alleged tactics was to show their proof to the show's producers. Gathering their evidence in the form of a detailed table and chart, Lisa and Robert brought their concerns to the attention of the producers via a formal letter. In the letter, they laid out the patterns they discovered and explained that the alleged manipulative ratings were the reason their own home did not win the prize. The couple also politely requested a revision of their episode's scores to ensure a fairer outcome. Following the Fodens' revelations, the Channel 4 producers decided to investigate the matter further, comparing the scores over other episodes where the accused couple resided. Although there was hesitation in making a final decision due to the subjective nature of judging homes, the compelling evidence provided by the Fodens led to the show's producers taking swift action. To make amends for the alleged foul play, the May The Best House Win production team decided to combine the scores of the Foden's house against a different set of episodes, resulting in a more fair comparison. After a complete reassessment of the scores, the Fodens' Bond-themed home was declared the new grand winner of the show, and they were finally awarded the sought-after £1,000 prize. The Channel 4 team reached out to the Foden couple, who expressed their gratitude for the fairer outcome. The show's producers ensured that future episodes would be closely monitored to prevent manipulative scoring tactics from affecting the overall results. The couple featured in the original winning episode was barred from participating in future shows, and their victory was stripped from the record. In the weeks that followed, the story unfolded in the media, gaining widespread public attention. The show saw a surge in viewership as the audiences became curious about the result of the Fodens' tireless pursuit of fairness. Out of controversy came growth, and Channel 4 vowed to enhance their show's integrity and maintain the original lighthearted spirit of friendly competition. For the Fodens, their efforts did more than just secure victory. Their dedication to fairness transformed a potentially negative experience into a lesson in perseverance and advocating for justice in a seemingly innocent TV show. Ultimately, their actions reshaped the rules of May The Best House Win and served as an important reminder to always stand up for what is right, even when it comes to the less critical, but equally as meaningful aspects of life."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, traveled in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. Barrow partnered with Harry Stevens in 1894 to sell concessions at baseball games. He helped George Moreland form the Interstate League, a Class-C minor league, in 1894. Barrow, with Stevens and Al Buckenberger, purchased the Wheeling Nailers of the Interstate League in 1896. Barrow served as field manager until the collapse of the league that season. The team continued in the Iron and Oil League for the rest of the year. Barrow then bought the Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, managing them for the rest of the 1896 season. Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for 2,100 the next year (61,774 in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to pitch a few innings a game. From 1897 through 1899, Barrow served as president of the Atlantic League. During this time, in the winter of 1898-99, Barrow and Jake Wells established a movie theater in Richmond, Virginia. Barrow managed Paterson again in 1899, but the league folded after the season. With the money earned from the sale of the Richmond movie theater, Barrow purchased a one-quarter share of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class-A Eastern League in 1900 from Arthur Irwin, and served as the team's manager. Irwin, hired to be the manager of the Washington Senators of the NL, brought his most talented players with him. Rebuilding the Maple Leafs, Barrow acquired talented players, such as Nick Altrock, and the team improved from a fifth-place finish in 1899, to a third-place finish in 1900, and a second-place finish in 1901. The Maple Leafs won the league championship in 1902, even though they lost many of their most talented players, including Altrock, to the upstart American League (AL). Barrow managed in the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 1903, finishing fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest of the season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. Did he change teams?","response":"Yes, the person in the story, Barrow, changed teams several times. He started with the Wheeling Nailers, then moved to the Paterson Silk Weavers, after that, he became the manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He also managed the Detroit Tigers, Montreal Royals, and Indianapolis Indians."},{"question":"Here is a news article: Apple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently.

Apple ran into battery issues with the iPhone 5s last October, shortly after its release. Of course, you could just hit up your local Walmart to buy a brand new iPhone 5c for less than 1. The bargain-basement 97-cent price tag also requires a two-year service agreement with AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint, or U.S. Cellular. The superstore is also selling the speedier iPhone 5s for a 20 discount, dropping the 99 asking price to 79 with the same two-year contract. But with Cupertino's iPhone 6 announcement reportedly just around the corner, it may be easier for some to simply wait for the next-gen handset to hit shelves.

Fact 2: When a substance melts, it changes phase from a solid to a liquid by the application of heat. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can be done to a solid by adding heat energy?\\" with the following options: - massive damage - phasing the bubbles - It expands - cooling the center - Evaporation - changing the phase - removing the air - Water expanding Answer:","response":"By adding heat energy to a solid, the process that will occur is the change of phase, specifically, the transformation from a solid to a liquid. This process is known as melting. Melting occurs when heat energy is applied to a solid substance, causing its particles to gain kinetic energy and move faster. As a result, the bonds between the particles become weaker and less stable, leading to a change in the physical state of the substance from solid to liquid. The change in phase that occurs during melting is due to the breaking of the rigid structure present in the solid state, which is replaced by a less organized liquid state. Although some of the other options listed may occur under different circumstances or as a side effect of the heating process, the primary effect of adding heat energy to a solid is the change in phase through the process of melting. For instance, some solids might expand when heated, and some substances can eventually evaporate after transitioning to the liquid state.

The oil spilled on Nick 's shirt while he cooked for Justin, so","response":"he quickly opted to change his clothes before the stubborn stain had a chance to set. But the sight of the spreading oil stain reminded Nick of a childhood memory when his mom was preparing fried chicken for dinner. A similar mishap had happened, and she had soaked the shirt in vinegar and hand-washed the grease out. Although the evening recently took an expected turn, Nick felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him, grateful that he had the opportunity to revisit the past briefly. Unwilling to let the oil stain ruin his pleasant memory, Nick dashed to his room to find a clean shirt. Knowing the stain would be harder to remove the longer it lingered, he also grabbed a small bowl and filled it with vinegar. After soaking the shirt in the solution, he set it aside and changed into a fresh one. As the comforting smell of dinner wafted through the air, Nick turned his attention back to the task at hand: preparing a meal for his old friend, Justin. The two were inseparable growing up, and their lives intertwined on so many levels. They knew each other's likes and dislikes, which made cooking dishes that suited both of their tastes a breeze. This time, Nick opted for a mouthwatering Italian feast consisting of creamy mushroom fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled chicken, served with delicious garlic ciabatta, and a summer tomato-arugula salad on the side. The preparation required a bit more focus and diligence than he anticipated, noting that his pan was still sizzling from the earlier oil spill. A sigh escaped his lips as he wiped the pan clean and started over, ensuring that the oil was at the right temperature this time. However, despite the minor setback, Nick carried on, fueled by the happy memories of cooking together with his friend Justin. Recounting their youthful culinary adventures and the satisfaction of sharing a homemade meal, he focused on the warmth that the memory stirred within him. It gave him the motivation he needed to finish the dinner preparations. Meanwhile, Justin was on his way to Nick's apartment and couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. Reuniting with his oldest friend made him reflect on their journey as friends and the valuable time they spent growing side by side. Both of them had come a long way, each pursuing different careers and settling in various parts of the world. But their bond remained strong, and they always managed to pick up where they left off. Upon seeing each other, the two old friends embraced warmly—a hug filled with memories and unspoken words. They exchanged stories and caught up on each other's lives, reminiscing about the times they shared while growing up. Over the delightful Italian feast, Nick and Justin rediscovered their incredible connection, spoke about their individual accomplishments, and shared heartaches, dreams, and future plans. As the evening wound down to a close, they found comfort in the knowledge that, despite the passage of time, the bond between them remained unbroken. Despite the various turns and bends their individual lives had taken, the memory of sharing time together in the kitchen solidified the roots of their friendship.

Elliptic geometry has a variety of properties that differ from those of classical Euclidean plane geometry. For example, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always greater than 180°. - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807 December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator. - In mathematics, particularly in the theories of Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, a homogeneous space for a group \\"G\\" is a non-empty manifold or topological space \\"X\\" on which \\"G\\" acts transitively. The elements of \\"G\\" are called the symmetries of \\"X\\". A special case of this is when the group \\"G\\" in question is the automorphism group of the space \\"X\\" here \\"automorphism group\\" can mean isometry group, diffeomorphism group, or homeomorphism group. In this case \\"X\\" is homogeneous if intuitively \\"X\\" looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of \\"G\\" be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of \\"G\\" on \\"X\\" which can be thought of as preserving some \\"geometric structure\\" on \\"X\\", and making \\"X\\" into a single \\"G\\"-orbit. - In Riemannian geometry, the sectional curvature is one of the ways to describe the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. The sectional curvature \\"K\\"() depends on a two-dimensional plane in the tangent space at a point \\"p\\" of the manifold. It is the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane as a tangent plane at \\"p\\", obtained from geodesics which start at \\"p\\" in the directions of (in other words, the image of under the exponential map at \\"p\\"). The sectional curvature is a smooth real-valued function on the 2-Grassmannian bundle over the manifold. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curriculae. A politician, he had served as state senator in New York. He was later appointed as a US diplomat to Germany and Russia, among other responsibilities. - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called BolyaiLobachevskian geometry or Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry. In hyperbolic geometry the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with: - Cornell University is an American private Ivy League and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgefrom the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \\"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\\" - Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the \\"Elements\\". Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The \\"Elements\\" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the \\"Elements\\" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Daina Taimina ( Latvian : Taimia ; born August 19 , 1954 ) is a Latvian mathematician , currently Adjunct Associate Professor at Cornell University , known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space . - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - In mathematics, hyperbolic space is a homogeneous space that has a constant negative curvature, where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature. It is hyperbolic geometry in more than 2 dimensions, and is distinguished from Euclidean spaces with zero curvature that define the Euclidean geometry, and elliptic geometry that have a constant positive curvature. - Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity. This covers the ancient Mediterranean world, particularly ancient Greece and Rome. It encompasses the study of ancient languages, literature, philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the West, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities and a necessary part of a rounded education. Since the 20th century, however, Classics is no longer a part of a typical elite education. - In geometry, Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces. It is named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria. The term \\"Euclidean\\" distinguishes these spaces from other types of spaces considered in modern geometry. Euclidean spaces also generalize to higher dimensions. - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.

[In Photos: A Walk Through Stonehenge] The new discovery may also identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge. A few gigantic pine posts, possibly totem poles, were raised at Stonehenge between 8,500 and 10,000 years ago, but until now there was scant evidence of occupation in the area that long ago. The new research suggests those ancient structures may perhaps have been raised to honor a sacred hunting ground. Mysterious monument For decades, people have wondered at the enigmatic stone structures erected roughly 5,000 years ago in the plains of Wiltshire, England. No one knows why ancient people built the structure: some believe it was a place of ancient worship or a sun calendar, whereas still others think it was a symbol of unity or even that Stonehenge was inspired by a sound illusion. The large megaliths, known as sarsens, are up to 30 feet tall and weigh up to 25 tons, while the smaller bluestones weigh up to 4 tons. Researchers think the giant boulders came from a quarry near Marlborough Downs, just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the iconic site, while the bluestones likely came from Preseli Hills in Wales, nearly 156 miles (250 km) away from Stonehenge. Old photographs Jacques was looking through archival photographs of the region surrounding Stonehenge when he spotted a site known as Vespasian's Camp, just a mile from Stonehenge in nearby Amesbury. Realizing that it hadn't been fully surveyed, Jacques began to investigate the area, which harbored a freshwater spring. Because animals like to stop and drink at such watering holes, Jacques wondered whether ancient man may have settled nearby as well. The team uncovered roughly 350 animal bones and 12,500 flint tools or fragments, as well as lots of evidence of burning. Carbon dating suggested the area was occupied by humans from 7500 B.C. to 4700 B.C. — roughly 5,000 years prior to the erection of the first stones at Stonehenge. [See Photos of the Stonehenge Hunting Ground ] \\"The spring may have originally attracted large animals to it, which would have aided hunting and may have led to associations that the area was a sacred hunting ground,\\" Jacques wrote. In addition, the researchers found tools made from stone from one region of England, but fashioned in the style of another region (for instance, a stone tool made from Welsh or Cornwall slate, but made in a style typical of Sussex). That suggests the people from different regions were coming together at the site, Jacques wrote. Ancient builders? The findings could help researchers pinpoint why the ancient builders of Stonehenge chose the place they did, Jacques said. \\"We have found a bridge from which transmission of cultural memory about the 'specialness' of the place where the stones were later being put up was possible,\\" Jacques wrote. \\"We are getting closer to understanding their reasons for putting it up — it is all to do with ancestors, but those ancestors go much further back than has previously been realised.\\" The findings show \\"there was a substantial interest in the Stonehenge landscape well before the stones were hauled there and erected,\\" said Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K., who was not involved in the study. Excavations dating to 2008 at Stonehenge also confirm earlier use at the megalithic site, Darvill wrote. However, what makes the Amesbury discovery special is the large trove of auroch bones found in the area, which suggests the spring was on a natural migration route for the wild aurochs, he said. A program about the Amesbury site will air on BBC 4 on April 29. Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter @tiaghose. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

The teachers tried to fit all the books into the schools but the","response":"volumes were simply too numerous and space in the schools too limited. The effort was admirable, yet it appeared herculean given the sheer quantity of books that were to be integrated. The number of books was staggering, encompassing several thousands, each carrying immense educational value and potential to positively impact the students. These books were acquired from various sources including donations from non-profit organizations and individuals who wished to enrich the libraries of these institutions. Teaching aids, textbooks, fiction, non-fiction, research journals, periodicals, encyclopedias, atlases – the spectrum of book categories was diverse. They included seminal works of literature, science, history, and arts that had the potential to shape and inspire the young minds in the institutions. They possessed enormous potential to contribute not just to the academic understanding of the students but also to their overall personality development, by broadening their perspectives on varied subjects and encouraging them to think creatively and critically. The teachers, fully aware of their usefulness and the importance of these learning resources, were determined to incorporate them into the school system. They toiled tirelessly, sorting and categorizing the books, arranging them methodically in an attempt to fit them into the limited space. They even tried creative spacing solutions - making use of the walls for hanging bookshelves, attempting to crowd the library spaces more efficiently, even looking to find space under stairwells and unused corners. However, the space the schools provided was highly limited. Education facilities, especially those in busy urban environments or underserved rural areas, often suffer from space constraints. Classrooms were already packed with students, leaving little extra space for new bookshelves. Existing libraries, despite their best efforts to maximize storage solutions, struggled to accommodate the influx of these new books. Furthermore, increasing the capacity to store books in the school comes with logistical issues. The overcrowded spaces could lead to issues related to the maintenance and preservation of the books. Increasing the books to an insurmountable quantity might hamper the students' accessibility to these resources, as locating a particular book in a sea of texts would become increasingly difficult. What this situation underscores is a larger issue faced by numerous educational institutions - the desirability for more resources yet the struggle to accommodate them. The teachers' efforts become emblematic of a universal endeavor in education to provide more for students, yet the limitations of physical infrastructure can sometimes prove to be challenging. As such, the teachers’ dilemma of trying to fit all the books into the schools highlights the necessity for scaling up infrastructure, for improved storage solutions, and potentially for exploring digital alternatives, to ensure that valuable resources such as these books can be incorporated and utilized effectively in the learning process."},{"question":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Everybody at the picnic thought breastfeeding publicly is a good idea","response":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that people at the outdoor luncheon in Cambridge, MA, were comfortable with and accepting of public breastfeeding. While the scenario suggests that nobody minded the public breastfeeding, there may be various opinions that individuals held but did not express. It is important to consider several factors before concluding that everyone at the event thought public breastfeeding is a good idea: 1. Cultural context: The acceptance of public breastfeeding could be linked to the cultural attitudes in the area, as Cambridge, MA, is generally recognized as a progressive and open-minded community. This context, however, does not guarantee that every individual present held the same positive perspective on public breastfeeding. 2. Individual beliefs: People often have different beliefs and values based on their upbringing, personal experiences, religious or cultural backgrounds, or education. Thus, it is possible that some individuals may have had reservations or concerns about public breastfeeding, but chose not to express their opinions in order not to offend the mother or disrupt the event. 3. Social pressure: In some cases, individuals may choose to conform to the collective opinion or behavior within a social situation due to the desire to fit in, avoid conflict, or adhere to societal norms. It could be that some people at the event did not agree with public breastfeeding, but felt uncomfortable or unwilling to speak out and draw attention to their differing opinion. 4. Tolerance vs. endorsement: It is crucial to differentiate between tolerating a behavior and actively endorsing it.

Some people may have personal reservations about the practice but were respectful of the mother's choice and did not want to interfere.

A: try a new food B: going C: ignore them The answer to this question is:","response":"C: ignore them According to the context provided, Jordan told Robin that she was going to a new school next year and would not see her. This may spark a range of emotions in Robin, such as sadness, anger, or a feeling of loss. As a result, Robin may feel the need to distance herself from Jordan, either to cope with these emotions or to make the impending separation easier to bear.

The other options, A: try a new food, and B: going, do not seem fitting in this context as they are not connected to the situation of Jordan leaving to a new school and the emotions that Robin may be experiencing.

Rashmi Patel, 45, of Suffield, turned himself in Tuesday at the Enfield Police Department and was charged with a misdemeanor count of criminally negligent homicide and a felony count of tampering with evidence, police said. Patel has offices in Enfield and Torrington. The charges came exactly one year after Patel's patient, 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington, died in hospital on February 17, 2014. Charged: Rashmi Patel, 45, turned himself in to police Tuesday night on a warrant for his arrest, one year after the death of his patient, Judith Gan, 64, who flat-lined in his dentist chair during a marathon operation. Going to trial: Dentist Rashmi Patel, center, sits at a hearing of the Connecticut State Dental Commission in Hartford on Wednesday, December 17, 2014. He has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide. State dental regulators concluded that Patel failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low when she was consciously sedated in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in Patel's Enfield office the same day. Patel, who posted 25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. He and his attorney didn't return messages Wednesday. Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a monthslong review of his practice and permanently ban him from performing conscious sedation. The commission said in a report that Patel 'ignored' signs that Gan was in distress, including the drop in her oxygen saturation, changes in the color of her face and hands, and wheezing and gurgling sounds. Scene: Gan went into distress and later flat-lined during a complex procedure at Dr. Patel's Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut. She had a complex history of medical issues that Patel was aware of. The commission said Patel also ignored warnings from his dental assistants that Gan was in danger and continued on with the procedures. The assistants told Patel to stop operating, but he pressed ahead. When one of the assistants yelled that Gan was 'flat lining,' Patel tried to revive Gan while the assistant called 911, according to the Dental Commission's report. Judith Gan, 64, died suddenly on February 17, 2014. Gan was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit, given that her extensive medical history. Gan had suffered a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the last two years, and the medication she was on could have affected her response to the sedation. Patel was aware of Gan's medical issues. Patel also violated care standards in December 2013, when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a throat pack, which was designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. The patient began flailing, his blood pressure spiked and he was rushed to a hospital but recovered. A lawyer for Gan's husband has said a lawsuit against Patel is planned. Patel was also sued for malpractice in 2009 for 'shoddy' dental work, according to The New York Daily News. The victim, Doreen Jasonis, won 500,000 from a jury before Patel appealed and settled out of court. Banned: Patel’s license, which was issued in 2003, was suspended in April. In December, the board banned him from treating patients under sedation. Write highlights for this article.","response":"Sure, I can do that, buddy! This is like telling a story. A man named Rashmi Patel, who is a dentist, did something very bad. He was supposed to help a lady named Judith Gan, by taking out her teeth and putting in some fake ones. But instead, the lady got very sick while in his chair and later she passed away in the hospital. The police said that Rashmi Patel did something wrong and now he must face consequences. He didn't listen when the people working with him said that the lady wasn't feeling well, and he went on with his work. Even when they told him that the lady was very sick, he didn't stop. The lady had some health issues already before coming to the dentist that he knew about, but he still went on to do a lot of work on her teeth, which was too much for her to handle. This dentist has done wrong things before, like another time when a patient nearly choked on a piece of cloth during an operation. So his license, which is like a permission slip to do his job, got taken away. The police also think he did something wrong with some stuff that could have proven he did these bad things, so he got into more trouble for that. The lady's husband is very sad and upset, so he will file a lawsuit, which is a big complaint in court, against this dentist."},{"question":"Context: Coming off their road win over the Bears, the Giants flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 14 NFC East rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles.

Given the question \\"How would Bailey feel afterwards?\\", is \\"happy afterwards\\" a valid answer? Options are: (A). Yes; (B). No; Answer:","response":"(B). No; \\"Happy afterwards\\" would not be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Bailey feel afterwards?\\" when considering the situation in which Bailey eventually realizes that he had forgotten her birthday. It is unlikely that Bailey would feel happy upon realizing that he forgot something as significant as a loved one's birthday. In general, when people forget important events or milestones for someone they care for, it often leads to negative emotions such as guilt, remorse, or embarrassment. Forgetting a birthday might make Bailey feel guilty for not remembering an important day and potentially disappointing or hurting the other person. It could also trigger embarrassment as others might view it as a sign of negligence or lack of attentiveness. Furthermore, Bailey might feel the need to make it up to the person whose birthday was forgotten, which could involve apologizing, explaining the situation, and trying to find a way to celebrate the missed occasion. This desire to mend the relationship and make amends could result in feelings of stress or anxiety if Bailey struggles to come up with an appropriate way to rectify the situation. Thus, given the emotional implications of forgetting someone's birthday, \\"happy afterwards\\" would not be a sensible answer to the question of how Bailey would feel in this scenario. A more fitting response might include feelings of guilt, remorse, or embarrassment, as well as a desire to make amends with the person whose birthday was neglected."},{"question":"Choose how you want this story to end.

In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts. Now, I have a new situation: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.

In 1492, Granada was captured from the Moors, thereby completing the Reconquista. Portugal had during the 15th century – particularly under Henry the Navigator – gradually explored the coast of Africa, and in 1498, Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India. The Spanish monarchs met the Portuguese challenge by financing the expedition of Christopher Columbus to find a western sea route to India, leading to the discovery of the Americas in 1492.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The discovery of the Americas was primarily driven by competition between the newly formed nation of Spain and its neighboring country, Portugal, in their efforts to establish trade routes to Asia for valuable resources, as well as the countries' desire for territorial expansion. Spain and Portugal both engaged in exploration throughout the 15th century, with a focus on the African coastline and, later, on finding a direct route to Asia. The 1469 marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon brought two major kingdoms together, creating a unified Spain. Their joining of forces, coupled with the death of John II of Aragon in 1479, solidified their control over Spain. By 1492, they had completed the Reconquista by capturing Granada from the Moors, which further strengthened their rule and resources. During this time, Portugal had made significant progress in exploring the African coast. Prince Henry the Navigator directed these efforts, contributing to Portugal's far-reaching navigational advances. By 1498, Vasco da Gama succeeded in finding the long-sought sea route to India, strengthening Portugal's position as a dominant maritime force. Wishing to meet the Portuguese challenge, the Spanish monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, began to explore alternative routes to Asia. They decided to finance Christopher Columbus's expedition, which aimed to find a western sea route to India. In 1492, Columbus set sail and, although he did not reach his original destination, he instead discovered the Bahamas, marking the first known encounter between Europeans and the Americas. To summarize, the discovery of the Americas resulted from a combination of key factors: the unification of Spain, the competition for trade routes to Asia between Spain and Portugal, advances in navigation and exploration, and the Spanish monarchs' decision to finance the groundbreaking voyage of Christopher Columbus."},{"question":"Solve -7450 = -107*i - 9911 for i. Solve this problem.","response":"Alright, my little friend! Let's solve the equation step by step. We have the equation: -7450 = -107 * i - 9911 Our job is to find out the value of \\"i.\\" Now let's solve it together. First, we should get rid of the -9911. To do that, we will add 9911 to both sides of the equation: -7450 + 9911 = -107 * i - 9911 + 9911 After adding, we'll get: 2461 = -107 * i Now, we want to find \\"i,\\" so we need to get rid of the -107 that is being multiplied by \\"i.\\" To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -107: 2461 / -107 = (-107 * i) / -107 Now let's do the division: -23 = i There you go!

Question: what is the last faith mentioned? Context: A year before Alfonso III \\"the Great\\" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them. The eldest son, García, became king of León. The second son, Ordoño, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms.

Due to his refusal to wear the prison uniform, he is labeled \\"non-cooperative\\" and is sent to his cell naked, with only a blanket for warmth. His new roommate, Gerry (Liam McMahon), has smeared the cell with faeces from floor to ceiling and we witness their resistance to the prison regime. The two men get to know each other, as we see them living in the cell.During a visitor day, Gerry's girlfriend sneaks in a small radio by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina.Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, which are grown as part their protest. The prisoners resist with Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender) spitting in Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only this time missing, and punching the wall in the process, which causes his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard, then has his men throw Sands in the bath tub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again in the same brutal manner as before. Lohan is then seen washing his hands as his hands are bloodied, in a similar way similar to the first scene.Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards can be seen and heard snickering, as the clothes handed to the prisoners. Sands' initial action to this process is to tear up his clothes and wreck his cell, to which the rest of the prisoners mirror in their own cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot officers are seen arriving at the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then thrown in...

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

Similar legislation passed by the House was also said to leave millions uninsured. Some Republicans have voiced reservations about the plan. But the White House disputed the CBO's figures. Responding to Monday's report, it said: \\"The CBO has consistently proven it cannot accurately predict how healthcare legislation will impact insurance coverage.\\" The report is a review of draft legislation unveiled by the Republican party last week. It is unlikely to be approved by Democrats, who see the proposals as cruel and unfair. The CBO said that 15 million more people would be uninsured by 2018 under the proposed legislation than under current law, largely because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated. Donald Trump called the House healthcare bill that resulted in 23 million additional uninsured by 2026 \\"mean\\". How might he describe a Senate version that only reduces those numbers to 22 million? Less affluent Americans currently on government-managed Medicaid insurance, many of whom supported the president, will see a 26% reduction in their programmes funding over the next decade, resulting in fewer covered and skimpier benefits. That is a tough pill for moderate Republicans, who will be under enormous pressure from their constituents to vote against the bill. There is some good news in the CBO report, of course. Thanks to the cuts, the Senate measure would reduce the budget deficit by a total of 321bn (Â£252bn) in 2017-2026 - even with Obama-era tax cuts rolled back. The personal health insurance marketplace is estimated to remain largely stable, and premiums will go down (after a spike next year). The bottom line, however, is that the CBO report is a blow to the Senate bill's chances of success. House Republicans weathered a similar beating and rallied to pass their version, so it is much too early to write a political epitaph. That assumes, of course, that their efforts are not undermined by the man in the Oval Office. President Donald Trump's Republican party is struggling to secure the 50 votes it needs to get its bill through the Senate when it comes to the floor. On Thursday, Republicans Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee and Rand Paul said they were \\"not ready to vote for this bill\\", but were \\"open to negotiation\\". Their concerns about the measure include its rollback of the expansion of Medicaid, the public health program for the poor and disabled. Mr Johnson said on Sunday there was \\"no way\\" there should be a vote on the legislation this week. The Senate bill would slash taxes for the wealthy offering less help for working families to buy medical insurance. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi earlier warned that \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of Americans would die if congressional Republicans pass their healthcare legislation. Republicans have rejected the notion that anyone will die as a result of their healthcare plan. What was that article about?","response":"This article is about a new healthcare plan proposed by the Republican party.

Lot's to talk about including the unfortunate (alleged) Jon Gosselin affair, Paula Abdul's sudden admission of a painkiller addiction and Lindsay Lohan... just because. Oh, and looking ahead to Saturday night's White House Correspondents Dinner. Though after the star-studded inauguration we went through only a few months back, the WHCA Dinner doesn't seem like as big of a deal this year. We'll see -- I did hear a rumor that Tom Cruise may show up and, much to Jen Chaney's delight, Jason Bateman will be in attendance. Here's a list of all the star power expected to be on hand -- so far. Let's get started... Possum Island: Dear Liz, I've been thinking lately about the whole celeb/famous person privacy/publicity balance. Specifically Elizabeth Edwards's book and Sara Jessica/Matthew B.'s surrogate thing. I mean, obviously these are public figures, and anything that happens to them is news. Mrs. Edwards's husband confessed to his affair publicly. Does it then follow that Mrs. Edwards writes a book about it? And I'm happy for SJ/MB, but now of course everyone wants to know who the surrogate is, and her family is under the microscope. After having \\"exposed\\" themselves, will they all eventually say, \\"I'm a victim of the media/paparazzi?\\" What do you think? Thanks. Liz Kelly: This is a well-thought out query. I'll do my best to make some sense here. This goes back to the whole privacy line debate we had here last week and have talked about several times over the years. There is definitely a line and, yes, certain sectors of the press can be a bit overzealous in their pursuit of private details about the lives of public figures. It sucks, but it comes with the territory. Which is why I am still somewhat amazed by people who enter into public life -- be it a politician or an actor -- and then proceed to leave themselves wide open to the vipers who are always waiting in the wings hoping for a hot scoop. At this point one has to know it comes with the territory. It may not be right, but there it is. And as absurd as some of this stuff is -- Star Magazine, ahem -- it is part of the price of having a free press and that's not something I'm willing to trade in. I think the Elizabeth Edwards book is a different issue. We're still in the privacy realm, but I'm tempted to say that the issue with Edwards is more about profiting from pain -- her own, her husbands, her childrens' and that of the supposed Edwards love child. Maureen Dowd said it better: But it's just a gratuitous peek into their lives, and one that exposes her kids, by peddling more dregs about their personal family life in a book, and exposes the ex-girlfriend who's now trying to raise the baby girl, a dead ringer for John Edwards, in South Orange, N.J. I have a lot of respect for Elizabeth Edwards and think she could have written a compelling worthwhile book without inflicting more pain. Is it a violation of privacy? Yes. But I suppose if anyone is entitled to violate it, then it is Elizabeth herself. Liz Kelly: RE: SJP's surrogate, apparently she's been unmasked as something of a wild child. And here's a link to the Maureen Dowd column referenced above. Throw your sister under the bus for Us Weekly: Who knows if Jon Gosselin is cheating or not - but that guy who who claims his sister is the mistress is as bad as the loser who ratted out Michael Phelps with the pot pics. Something tells me it is going to be a very unhappy Thanksgiving at the bro and sis house this year. Liz Kelly: That family kind of loses either way, eh? The ballad of Kiefer Sutherland: Clearly KS has issues. The intriguing/confusing aspect to the story is the weirdness coming out of Brooke Shields' camp - her reps say they don't know why Kiefer headbutted the designer, but they also claim ignorance on whether she was pushed or whatever. (If they are authorized to speak for her, you would think they would get the full story first.) washingtonpost.com: EW: Brooke Shields' rep contradicts Kiefer Sutherland Liz Kelly: Three years ago Tom Cruise almost lost his career trying to save Brooke Shields from antidepressants. Now Kiefer Sutherland is charged with assault for defending her honor and may end up back in jail. A coincidence or is Brooke Shields the unlucky tiki of the celebrity set? Andrew Morton's Angelina book: Rarely do I believe anything Star magazine says, but surely if their story is accurate Morton should have a monster libel case on his hands. The first line of the cover story from this week's issue reads, \\"Angelina Jolie is a jealous, cunning liar who cheated on Brad with a famous rock star, schemed to lure him away from Jennifer Aniston -- and even slept with her own mother's boyfriend!\\" Liz Kelly: Hot diggity! That sounds like good summer beach reading. Jon Gossel, IN: I've watched the show some. Their kids have the same age spread as mine and on a smaller level, I can relate to their trials and tribulations. So last week, I stumbled into the land of Kate Hate. It's a rough and tumble land, current capital, Detroit. But this week, the details are coming out about Jon. Wow. Who in their right mind would sign up for a reality show when their personal life is falling apart? Oh, I'm sorry, I believe Bobby Brown, Hulk Hogan, and several \\"Real Housewives\\" have already answered that question. If I were Kate, I would say, \\"Go have your affair...only you have to have it with Nadya Suleman.\\" Liz Kelly: Again, this goes back to the question of private details about public lives. And while I don't have any emotional investment in either Jon or Kate (tho the eight are pretty irresistible), I'm sorry to see their dirty laundry being aired so publicly. Two things to remember: Specific to this case: We don't know that Jon actually had an affair, although it probably wasn't the best idea for him to go clubbing with some woman who is not his wife. In general: Humans are fallible. Even humans who score TV contracts or recording deals or walk red carpets and make millions of dollars a year. Funny-ish story: I'm on the elevator and two middle-aged men get on. One guy keeps saying, \\"I think it was Renee Zellweger\\" and other is like, \\"Really, was it like 10 minutes?\\" At this point, I'm like, what are these people talking about in the elevator? Then they go quiet and when they are about to get off the elevator, one guy says, \\"I think it was Kirsten Dunst.\\" The other says, \\"No, I'm pretty sure it was Renee Zellweger.\\" \\"Wasn't it for like 5 minutes or a couple of hours?\\" \\"Nah, I think we're talking months here...\\" I finally realized they were talking about a quickie marriage. Definitely Renee, not Kirsten, yes? Liz Kelly: Oh, definitely Renee. Has anyone out there seen \\"Apaloosa?\\" A perfectly good Western utterly ruined by Renee Zellweger. Even Kirsten Dunst would have been an improvement. ishkabible: The Daily Beast, a mostly intellectual online news source, had a 3-page article about Heincer. I was devastated. It was like discovering the ants you thought were ONLY in your kitchen are now in the upstairs bed room. I thought about forwarding it to you Liz, for gems like, \\"The paparazzi are like family members to us\\" and \\"You're gonna have to pry Speidi's fame from our dead hands.\\" But THEN I read: \\"a post about me gets like 2,000 of the most evil comments. But I'm motivated by those reactions....They keep me going. It's juice. It's power. Persecute me, please.\\" Well played, you little prat. I put the matter before Liz, Producer Paul, and the collective wisdom of the Celebritology community. Would it be better to engage in the snarkfest Heincer so RICHLY deserves, or pretend we didn't notice them? The article in question: The Speidi Chronicles Liz Kelly: It's a lose-lose situation. Actually, maybe even lose-lose-lose. Kiefer, continued: What I find interesting about this whole kerfuffle is that Brooke Shields has to be substantially taller than Kiefer. I know he's Jack Bauer and all but how exactly does she need defending from a designer? Liz Kelly: Well, tall doesn't necessarily mean strong. But I would guess the difference is actually that Brooke Shields has some self control. WHCA Dinner : Jon Hamm and John Cusack?! Dear gawd...I need a ticket... Liz Kelly: Yes -- and although I'm not getting fully decked out (I'll be working, after all) my get-up is totally \\"Mad Men\\"-esque. I'm sure that'll make all the difference. College Radio: I teach at the school that hosts a radio station I've been listening to since I moved to the area. I have a total girl-crush on the station manager, the way the Fug-girls have a crush on Kelly Clarkson (\\"hey let's go have hot wings and drink beer and talk about boys!\\") But beyond our mutual employer, I have NO reason to start up a conversation or even run into her. (I teach night classes and don't really see other faculty or even go to department meetings.) So aside from walking into the station and saying \\"hey! You don't know me, but you seem like you kick ass. Wanna have lunch?\\" what is the least creepiest way I can meet this person? (I know this is sort of a Haxian question, but it's about a LOCAL celebrity, so I'm hoping you'll take it.) Liz Kelly: I'm going to open this up for suggestions... me, I'm not convinced there's a way to do this that won't seem weird. Anything I can think of just seems way too forced. I do feel your pain, though. I have totally been there. And I still think Russell Crowe and I would get along really well. Jason Bateman: Compared to his sister Justine, who started out on the very successful Family Ties series, Jason (who I first remember seeing in \\"Teen Wolf, Too\\") seems to have trod a much happier career path, playing nicely etched roles in movies like \\"Juno\\" and \\"State of Play.\\" Is he leading man material? I don't know -- not sure he takes himself that seriously. Liz Kelly: I think he's leading man material and I don't think he has to take himself seriously to move into that territory. And although \\"Arrested Development\\" was an ensemble show, it could be argued that Jason led that ensemble. I first remember him, btw, from \\"Family Ties,\\" on which he showed up from time to time as a friend of Ricky's. Along with Alfonso Ribiero (whose name I am probably butchering). Brad and Jen Meet-Up?: What do you make of this tale? Who has a movie coming out momentarily? (other than \\"Ben Button\\" on DVD) Liz Kelly: If memory serves, that particular \\"story\\" originated in Star Magazine, which -- as far as I can tell -- is written using Mad Libs books and a rotating list of celebrity names. Dork, Us: Okay, so I come out of two month Celebritology exile to find that Lilo and Jon Mayer are single again, as well as Farrah Fawcett having anal cancer, and Dom Delouise died. What other major events have I missed? Can I get a pic of Scarlet Johansson? Liz, I think I'm getting Scarletted out. We might need to retire her and solicit replacement ideas. Liz Kelly: I never thought I'd see the day when Paul tired of ScarJo. I'm curious as to who is on his kitchen list now. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? What did you miss? Hmm -- I'm assuming you know about Mel Gibson's divorce and young Russian girlfriend. Bawlmer, Hon: Thanks for the WHCD guest list! Do you know how one obtains tickets to the dinner? Was there any infighting this year over who got tickets and who didn't? And how is Ashton Kutcher going under CNN's name? Strange. Liz Kelly: News organizations buy tables and distribute the tickets as they see fit -- to people within the org and guests, who tend to be celebs and politicians. I won't actually be heading into the dinner, but instead covering the much more interesting pre-parties that basically take over every inch of the Hilton on Saturday eve. More Keifer and Brooke: If the designer Keifer assaulted was responsible for the \\"hat\\" Brooke Sheilds wore to the Kentucky Derby, then he deserved a headbutt. washingtonpost.com: No joke. She looks like something from \\"Super Mario Brothers.\\" Liz Kelly: That whole outfit is just wrong. Though I rarely see a star who can carry off a hat well. Some recent examples of stars who can: Drew Barrymore, Aretha Franklin. Usually, though, they just look like kids playing dress up. Why is that? Women used to look stunning in hats. Kal Penn: What are the chances of getting Kal to do a WashPost chat? He clearly has a huge fan base amongst the chatters, he could use it as a platform to discuss whatever the White House wants him to discuss, and a producer would be able to screen out all of the phone numbers and virtual panties. washingtonpost.com: This would depend on my competence and professionalism. So, slim. Liz Kelly: Paul is fishing for compliments. He knows he is a rock star. As for Kal, I'm guessing it wouldn't be out of the question to get him online. But, remember, the White House Web site does their own version of online chats so they may want him chatting exclusively on the administration's site. Quatch: Liz, Who is the MC for the White House Correspondents Dinner? I didn't see Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black or any other Comedy Central people in the guest list. Did I overlook them? Liz Kelly: It's Wanda Sykes -- hometown girl made good. She used to work for the NSA, though I'm not sure what her job entailed. 15th and L: Were you there when Stephen Colbert spoke at the White House Correspondents dinner a couple years ago? I have loved him ever since. Best line of the night, \\"Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 'reality'. And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\\" washingtonpost.com: Interesting address, 15th and L. Colbert Roasts President Bush - 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner Liz Kelly: That was the one I missed, sadly. Though I watched on C-SPAN -- which is, arguably, a better experience anyhow. Jason Bateman: \\"Family Ties\\" -- of course, you meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" Justine actually quit acting for a long time, and only recently came back to it. She had a role on \\"Desperate Housewives\\" a couple of seasons ago, and did something else recently that is escaping me at the moment... Liz Kelly: Yes, I meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" My mind is much from staying up until the wee hours writing \\"Lost\\" analysis. Non-fans will be pleased to learn that next week is the last episode until January 2010. Washington, DC: Come on Liz! We all know know that you had a front row seat for the biggest celebrity scoop of the week. So, spill it. How was the reunion between Page and Sally? Pictures! We want pictures. Liz Kelly: There was a pic in the article. Honestly, we didn't get many. It was raining and we were trying to wrangle two dogs and cameras at the same time. Page isn't usually too friendly with other dogs, but she was okay with Sally. I think Sally was just calm enough to not set Page on edge. Sally, btw, is a total sweetheart. College Radio:: Friend her on Facebook. Add a message about how you work there too and love her show. Over time, become friendly online. Eventually you can ask her \\"out.\\" It's like online dating, only weirder. wink. Liz Kelly: That's a thought... Facebook does seem to breed an odd kind of intimacy. Jason Bateman and Alfonso Ribeiro: You meant, \\"Silver Spoons,\\" right? Now I've got that theme song in my head for the rest of the afternoon! washingtonpost.com: I'll trade you for the \\"Family Ties\\" theme. Liz Kelly: Last night Jen Chaney and I both had the \\"Macgruber\\" theme stuck in our heads. It was painful. Washington, DC: I am obsessed with Twilight and Robert Pattinson. Alas, I am no teenager -- in my forties, married with kids. Can you help me? Liz Kelly: Does it help to know you are not alone and that there are legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? Speaking of which, Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. Liz Kelly: And just so we don't give the cats short shrift, here's a short video of Andy. The sound is bad and the camera work shaky, but that hasn't stopped me from watching it three or four times already. Washington, D.C.: Can I please have a picture of Andy. The guy I've been dating just told me his feelings for me faded while I am totally in to him. Yes, I am very aware of how pathetic this request is, but my cat lives 2,500 miles away with my mom. And, I can't even claim that I'm in college. She just choose her when I moved years ago. Oh, God. I'm that girl. Andy! Please! Stat! Liz Kelly: Oh no -- I'm glad I posted that video. You need it. And I know I'm biased, but Andy's better than your loser ex anyway. Prince Harry: I read that he is going to have an official USA visit this summer. Any chance he is coming to the DC area? Liz Kelly: I can't imagine he'd come all the way across the pond without a visit to the White House, but I haven't seen any details yet. Kal Penn: Did you see the press release about the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" Christmas movie that will come out in 2010? I need details as to how that is working. In other news, my life has been a little better now that Kal Penn has started tweeting more. Liz Kelly: I actually talked about that with Kal and John Cho when I interviewed them at ComicCon last July. Apparently the company that owns the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" franchise announced plans for a new movie last summer, but hadn't yet bothered to secure either Kal or John for the film. And, according to IMDB, the project still doesn't have any talent attached. Andy, Feline Valentino?: If I were a girl cat, I would be totally crushing on Andy. That come-hither look and mysterious smile; the guy wouldn't even need to show up with a nosegay of catnip... Liz Kelly: I know. It's ridiculous. And that white patch of hair on his chest/neck totally looks like he's wearing a dress shirt or a dickie. He's just naturally debonair. Possum Island: Re: College Radio, Have you actually seen this person? Because I once had a blind date with a DJ that I had only heard on radio/talked to on the phone, and man was I disappointed (actually frightened is more like it!) Liz Kelly: Wasn't that a movie? Jason Bateman: Not Family Ties, Silver Spoons. And I had a crush on him more than Rick(y) Schroeder. Plus, he was on \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and had a short-lived but brilliant sitcom called \\"It's Your Move.\\" I'm no longer a stalker. Liz Kelly: Just to make sure -- I did clarify that I meant \\"Silver Spoons,\\" yes? Page and Sally!: I had a similar experience with my family's dog, Jeter. I volunteer with a rescue in the are, and my parents brought him to visit, socialize and get microchipped. While we were there, another couple walks up with their dog. Zeno was the spitting image of Jeter, just lankier and 15lbs lighter. In more celebritological news, any good locales for celeb-watching this weekend? washingtonpost.com: When you play ball with Jeter, does he have to play extra deep because he's lost a step and can no longer make routine plays? Liz Kelly: A sports joke. In my chat. I'm going to cry. As for celeb watching, the Hilton is the prime spot. Usually there is a roped off fan area set up along the red carpet. But judging from years past, it is loaded with teenaged girls. So, be warned. Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. : He's 26! You're fine! Liz Kelly: Ehrm, no. He's 20. No man, No Cat, D.C.: Thank you. That was enough. I can finish my work today. Liz Kelly: Well, at least wait until 2 p.m. to get started. Bernie Madoff: The Movie: I'm thinking an old-time SNL reunion feature. Jon Lovitz as Madoff, Jane Curtin as the wife, and Nora Dunn as the newly surfaced tell-all assistant. (Lovitz already played the villain in the sendup of \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" so he has the role down pat.) washingtonpost.com: Wow, I had forgotten this was the episode Shatner hosted! Liz Kelly: I love that clip -- we showed that one last December in Weingarten's chat, too. It never gets old. Houston: Thanks for letting us bend your ear -as an alum of a Kentucky university, I have to set the record straight on the Brooke Shields hat thing - the traditional thing for high society women to do at the Kentucky Derby is to wear an ornate, over the top, hat. And the Derby is about nothing, if not tradition. Sort of like at some churches, ladies wear really elaborate headgear. So, as for the hat, Brooke was just doing in Rome what the Romans do. Liz Kelly: But \\"ornate, over the top\\" does not necessarily have to mean \\"ugly,\\" does it? Query: Can we qualify any future Lindsay Lohan work as \\"having no talent attached\\"? Justine actually quit acting for a long time: She was battling anorexia. Liz Kelly: That must have been after \\"Satisfaction,\\" in which she played the leader of an all girl beach band who was romancing a music producer played by Liam Neeson. Brooke Shields: And Andre Agassi didn't start winning again until after they split! Liz Kelly: The plot thickens. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? : No and No. I vote for Rachel Bilson. Mena from \\"That 70s Show.\\" washingtonpost.com: I think you mean Mila Kunis from \\"That '70s Show\\"? Or do you mean Mila in addition to Rachel? I'm confused. I'm leaning toward Robin Scherbatsky. legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? : You think that's bad? I know a married mother in her 50s who belongs to an online fan club for adult fans of Hanson. Owe the humanity! washingtonpost.com: I don't know if that's at typo or pun. Liz Kelly: It's a pun, Paul. A longtime entry in the Official Celebritology Glossary. Can I just say that I came into the building today to work because I have a few meetings. I went to the trouble of reserving a conference room so I could have my accustomed solitude while chatting. Too bad there's some kind of morale building sales meeting in the next conference room over. I think there may be role-playing and team building happening. It sounds like Grand Central Station. re: Pattinson: I, too, am struggling with an age inappropriate crush on Pattinson. Read some of the interviews he's done where he admits his total paranoia about being overwhelmed by fans or getting stabbed by someone in a crowd. GQ's interview was great. He seems to be someone who truly regrets becoming famous. Admittedly, I still have a crush on him, but now I feel BAD about it. (And you are right on about Cera. Tell Gene to shut his mouth.) washingtonpost.com: GQ: HE'S HOT, HE'S SEXY, HE'S UNDEAD Liz Kelly: Thank you and thank you. Olney, MD: FYI: Justine Bateman was last seen in several episodes of \\"Men in Trees\\" at the end of its first season which became the shows second season because of the writers strike. ABC canceled the series last season. Liz Kelly: Thank you -- and Producer Paul reminds me that Julia Roberts was also in \\"Satisfaction.\\" Brooke Shields: You know, if Brooke had added a couple more inches to her Derby outfit, no one would be taking about it. It looks like it's 2 sizes too small - not that she doesn't fit in it, but that the waist is too high, the v neck too low and the hemline too high. Liz Kelly: Dress too small, hat too big. Boston: Just want to say that \\"Ick. Nast\\" is my new quote of the summer. Stay classy, Jon's alleged's mistresses' brother! (My other quote is \\"Stay out of it Nick Lachey!\\" thanks to the Soup. Do you watch it? I love it). Liz Kelly: Yes. I watch and love. And \\"Stay out of it, Nick Lachey\\" was classic. Ner,DO: Just throwing this out there, but Justine Batement played a hooker on Arrested Development who tried to pickup Jason Bateman's character and ended up being his sister. The episode was titled Family Ties. I think it was one of the last episodes of the show. And yes, I'm already in line for the opening of the movie. Liz Kelly: That must have been in the third season -- which Mr. Liz and I started watching, but soon stopped after we realized there had been a serious decline in quality. Does it get better again? Replacement: Easy: Minka Kelley - shes going to be in DC for a while now too! washingtonpost.com: I'm not even sure she's the best looking woman on \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" I'll take Mrs. Coach. New Crush for Producer Paul: Miss California washingtonpost.com: She is what an ex-roommate of mine referred to as \\"Dirty Hot.\\" Liz Kelly: What is this, Maxim online? Falls Church, Va.: I'm sorry but I just don't get the appeal of Jennifer Garner. She's not very pretty (the angular face, puffy lips, stick out ears.....maybe pretty for an average woman but not a movie star). And then starring in awful AWFUL movies like \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\"...tell me, what's her appeal? Is she the luckiest woman on Earth to be so famous or what? washingtonpost.com: For guys, I posit it begins with the post 2006 Super Bowl episode of \\"Alias\\" where she beat up a plane full of bad guys in her underwear. She was the one in her underwear, to clarify. Liz Kelly: I think she's attractive. She's not classically beautiful, but she's got an interesting angular face and she's in fab shape. Much like Hillary Swank. And don't forget that in addition to \\"dirty hot,\\" there's also what we dubbed \\"ugly pretty\\" a couple of years back. People who are somehow not all that attractive, but you crush on them for some unknown reason. Vincent Gallo is one of these for me. Julia Roberts: So last night I was watching Green Day do American Idiot for VH1 Storytellers or whatever it's called, and at the end, there was a DMB video for a song called \\"Dreamgirl\\" and Julia Roberts was in it. (I may be wholly behind the times here, but I rarely watch \\"music\\" tv.) I just thought that was kind of weird, and doesn't she have better things to do? Also, ever since I saw Dave Matthews play a gifted but retarded man on \\"House\\" I can't help but think of him in that role at all times. Liz Kelly: That song and vid are a few years old, right? Just Curious: Why was the item about the passing of Stanley Tucci's wife in the \\"Rumor Mill\\" section of today's column? Seems he confirmed it to the NY Post. Liz Kelly: The version I saw was not confirmed. And the only other place I could find the story was Contact Music, which was a direct pull of the NY Post blurb. Maybe they've since updated? Question for the ages: Liz, which one of your chats do you love the most? (almost as bad as asking which pet you love the most) Liz Kelly: I love all of my chats equally, though for different reasons. Wanda Sykes for the White House Correspondants: Isn't that a little too obvious? Black president so we have to get a black comedian to MC? Having said that, she is hilarious. Liz Kelly: I think you're reading a little too much into this. Carm down. Liz Kelly: Okay -- apologies, but I need to run to the loo before I switch gears for the \\"Lost\\" chat.

The movie's plot revolves around the adventures of cousins Bo and Luke Duke, played by Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville, respectively, in the fictional Hazzard County. Jessica's character, Daisy Duke, is the cousin of Bo and Luke and works as a waitress in their uncle's, Uncle Jesse's, bar. In preparation for the role, Jessica underwent extensive physical training and worked on developing the southern accent required for Daisy Duke's character. As a tribute to the original television series, Daisy wears her signature shorts popularly known as \\"Daisy Dukes.\\" The 2005 film adaptation received mixed reviews from critics, but Jessica Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke became one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Following her acting debut in \\"The Dukes of Hazzard,\\" Jessica continued her acting career with roles in \\"Employee of the Month\\" (2006), \\"Blonde Ambition\\" (2007), and \\"Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous\\" (2008).

My mom suggested that I organize a food drive in our development and donate what I collected to a local shelter.Anything that would help finish the project seemed like a good idea, so I agreed.I made up flyers asking for donations and placed flyers at every house in my neighborhood. I was getting ready to fetch the cans from my neighbor's yards on the day of the food drive when all of a sudden it started to pour.Rain flooded the roads and wind blew hard, but I was determined to complete my task.My mom drove me around our development and I jumped out at every house to collect items people had put out. When we finally arrived the shelter, I was a little nervous because I had never been there before.The woman in charge was extremely grateful for the donations and said that the world would be ganizing the food drive and delighted that my service to the community would make a difference in people's lives. As I was leaving the shelter, a man asked if I was the one who had brought all the food.I shyly nodded, and he said, \\"A round here, you are a hero.\\" From that point on, I made myself a promise that I would serve the community more often, even when it was not required.Through this school assignment, I have realized that caring for others is an important part of living and the world would be a completely different place if people all help those who are less fortunate.

Here is a detailed analysis of these words: 1. Mughal structure: The term \\"mughal structure\\" refers to architectural landmarks or buildings that were built during the Mughal Empire in India, which lasted from the early 16th to the mid-19th century. Mughal structures are known for their unique combination of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles, characterized by the use of red sandstone or marble, intricate geometrical patterns and calligraphic details, arches, domes, and artistic gardens. Some famous examples of Mughal architecture include the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb, and Agra Fort. By mentioning a \\"mughal structure\\" in the sentence, it sets a precise context and location, allowing the reader to envision the scene with better clarity. 2. Fog: The word \\"fog\\" is crucial in creating the atmospheric conditions present in the scene. Fog is a thick cloud of tiny water droplets suspended in the atmosphere near the earth's surface that restricts visibility. By introducing fog, the sentence paints a picture of a more mysterious, obscured, and dreamy environment. Fog often gives a sense of calmness, solitude, and mystique, which further enhances the ambiance and mood of the scene being described. 3. Sunrise: The mention of \\"sunrise\\" adds a temporal dimension to the scene, specifying the time of day when the described event is taking place. Sunrise is the moment during which the upper limb of the sun appears on the horizon in the morning, typically signifying the beginning of a new day. This word helps to depict the quality of light during this time, which is often softer, warmer, and more diffused. The presence of sunrise also establishes a contrast between the emerging sunlight and the dense fog, highlighting the interplay of natural elements and adding a sense of beauty, hope, and serenity to the scene. In conclusion, \\"mughal structure,\\" \\"fog,\\" and \\"sunrise\\" are the most important words in the given sentence, as they work together to set the context, convey the atmosphere, and create a sense of mystery and beauty. With these words, the reader can visualize a majestic Mughal structure shrouded in fog and illuminated by the soft light of the rising sun, which makes for a captivating and evocative scene."},{"question":"Chaque gagnant d’un véhicule devient immédiatement propriétaire de ce dernier.

The Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to a 45-yard field goal by Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. An interception off Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian by cornerback Logan Ryan resulted in the only touchdown of the game&#8212;a 1-yard run by Patriots' running back LeGarrette Blount in the second quarter. Gostkowski added two more field goals&#8212;a 40-yarder in the third quarter and a 21-yarder in the fourth. The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for this game.

After learning that Texian troops had attacked Castañeda at Gonzales, Cos made haste for Béxar. Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor. Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued. After reading the above, is \\"Karl Inderfurth\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who met with Musharraf to discuss the issues of Pakistan cooperation with the U.S.?\\"?","response":"Yes, \\"Karl Inderfurth\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Who met with Musharraf to discuss the issues of Pakistan cooperation with the U.S.?\\" In the passage, it states that Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad in January 2000.

The state capital is Wiesbaden; the largest city is Frankfurt am Main. Until the formation of the German Reich in 1871, Hesse was an independent country ruled by a Grand Duke (Grand Duchy of Hesse). Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate. - Giovanni Speranza ( born March 6 , 1982 in Giessen ) is a German - Italian footballer currently plays for Vietnamese side Dak Lak . - Giessen, spelled Gießen in German, is a town in the German federal state (\\"Bundesland\\") of Hesse, capital of both the district of Giessen and the administrative region of Giessen.

Mission workers are typically associated with spreading religious messages or performing religiously motivated humanitarian work. 2. The provided options are \\"accomplish,\\" \\"notoriety,\\" \\"hellfire,\\" \\"learn about,\\" and \\"religion.\\" 3. \\"Accomplish\\" and \\"learn about\\" are too vague and do not specifically relate to mission work. 4. \\"Notoriety\\" is generally related to fame or being known for something negative, which does not align with the core values and goals of mission workers. 5. \\"Hellfire\\" may be an element present in the teachings of certain religious missionaries, but it does not cover the breadth of topics discussed by mission workers as a whole, as their primary focus is on their religion and its teachings. 6.

Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"The recent elections\\" can be translated to \\"Les récentes élections\\" in French. The word \\"recent\\" is translated to \\"récentes\\" which is an adjective that agrees with the plural feminine noun \\"élections\\". 2. \\"for the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament\\" is translated as \\"pour le Parlement du Kurdistan irakien\\". This follows the proper word order for prepositional phrases in French. The words \\"Iraqi\\" and \\"Kurdistan\\" are translated as \\"irakien\\" and \\"Kurdistan\\", respectively. Note that, in French, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, such is the case with \\"irakien\\". 3. \\"offer a renewed opportunity\\" can be translated to \\"offrent une occasion renouvelée\\". In this case, \\"offer\\" is translated to \\"offrent\\", which is the third person plural form of the verb \\"offrir\\" in French, because the subject \\"récentes élections\\" is plural. \\"Renewed\\" is translated as \\"renouvelée\\", an adjective that agrees with the feminine noun \\"occasion\\". 4. \\"to resume\\" is translated as \\"de reprendre\\" in French. The verb \\"reprendre\\" means \\"to resume\\" or \\"to take up again\\" and is used with the preposition \\"de\\" to express purpose or intention. 5. \\"constructive engagement\\" is translated as \\"engagement constructif\\" in French. In this case, the adjective \\"constructif\\" follows the French rule of placing the adjective after the noun it modifies. 6. \\"on outstanding issues\\" is translated as \\"sur les questions en suspens\\". Here, \\"outstanding\\" is translated to \\"en suspens\\", which means \\"unresolved\\" or \\"pending\\", and \\"issues\\" is translated to \\"questions\\". The preposition \\"sur\\" is used to denote the relationship between the engagement and the issues. Putting all of these together, the translation of \\"The recent elections for the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament offer a renewed opportunity to resume constructive engagement on outstanding issues\\" in French is: \\"Les récentes élections pour le Parlement du Kurdistan irakien offrent une occasion renouvelée de reprendre un engagement constructif sur les questions en suspens.\\""},{"question":"When learning language, people often don' t know which word to use, or pick the wrong ones by accident.

Options: - frustration - problems - misunderstandings - headaches - nausea Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"When learning a language, people often don't know which word to use, or pick the wrong ones by accident. This can cause misunderstandings. Explanation: When people use incorrect words or phrases during a conversation, it may create confusion and make it difficult for the listener to understand the intended meaning. Misunderstandings can occur when the wrong words are chosen or when people struggle to express themselves clearly as they learn a new language. This can lead to the incorrect interpretation of information or even conflict. While frustrations, problems, and headaches can also be valid outcomes of linguistic difficulties, these are not specific consequences of choosing the wrong words, but rather they are the resulting emotional and cognitive effects. Nausea, on the other hand, is unrelated to language learning and is typically a physical symptom associated with illness or other medical conditions."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The tram stop was named after the street , which had been named for Werner Stauffacher in 1893 . Stauffacher is officially just the name of the tram stop , not the square , and there was formerly a Stauffacherplatz some 200 m farther along the street towards the Sihl ( named in 1898 ) . Since the name of the tram stop induced common usage to associate Stauffacherplatz with the tram stop , leading to confusion with the actual Stauffacherplatz , the latter was renamed to Ernst - Nobs - Platz in 2003 . St. Jakob was the site of a sick - house outside the town of Zurich and an associated chapel since the 11th century . The first historical mention of the St. Jakob church dates to 1221 .

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The Sihl is a Swiss river that rises near the Druesberg mountain in the canton of Schwyz, and eventually flows into the Limmat in the centre of the city of Zürich. It has a length of , including the Sihlsee reservoir, through which the river flows. Water is abstracted from the river at the Sihlsee, leading to decreased downstream water flows and a consequent negative impact on water quality. - Aegidius (or Giles or Glig) Tschudi (5 February 150528 February 1572) was an eminent member of the Tschudi family, of Glarus, Switzerland.

Answer:","response":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than the particles in test B. This is because, in test A, John warmed up the reactants, which means he increased their temperature. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they gain energy and move more quickly. Consequently, the particles collide more frequently and with higher impact, thus increasing the rate of the chemical reaction. In contrast, in test B, John cooled down the reactants, causing their temperature to decrease. Lowering the temperature results in a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they lose energy and move more slowly. As a result, the particles collide less frequently and with less force, causing the chemical reaction rate to slow down. The practical examples from tests C and D further support this concept, as the food item kept in the refrigerator (test C) would have a slower rate of decomposition – a chemical reaction – than the food item left on the table top (test D). This is because the lower temperature inside the refrigerator slows down the decomposition processes, while the higher temperature at room conditions speeds up the reaction rate."},{"question":"Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it.

I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a person. The acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards. On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him. But don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it.

Translate this to English?","response":"Honorable speaker, 65 percent of toys imported into the European Union are manufactured in China. The given sentence, in Finnish, talks about a specific statistic in the context of the European Union's imports of toys. The sentence addresses an honorable speaker and provides an important piece of information: 65 percent of these toy imports originate from China. The fact that such a large percentage of toys imported into the European Union come from China is significant, as it highlights the prominent role of Chinese manufacturers in the global toy market and the close connection between the European and Chinese economies. These trade relations between China and the European Union may have several implications, both positive and negative. On one hand, economic cooperation between the two regions can lead to growth and development, as well as increase the availability and variety of products for consumers. These toy imports can provide more affordable options for families, offering a wide array of choices and promoting competition between companies, which may ultimately lead to improved product quality and innovation. On the other hand, some potential drawbacks might arise from the high percentage of toy imports from China. For instance, concerns about product safety and labor practices in China may make some people wary of purchasing Chinese-made toys. Additionally, the reliance on foreign imports could reduce the incentive for domestic toy production in the European Union, ultimately impacting the local industry and economy. Another question that arises from this statistic is the issue of environmental sustainability. The international transportation of goods, including toys, requires a lot of energy and generates a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Moreover, the production of toys often requires the consumption of raw materials and generates waste, leading to further environmental impacts. In conclusion, the fact that 65 percent of toys imported into the European Union are manufactured in China is an important piece of information that highlights the close economic ties between China and the European Union. This connection may yield several benefits, including economic growth and development and increased consumer choice. However, it is also important to consider the possible drawbacks and environmental impacts associated with such a high level of imports from one country, and to strive for a balance between economic progress and sustainability."},{"question":"Translate \\"However, this directive does not apply to military aviation.\\" to Finnish?","response":"Kuitenkaan tämä direktiivi ei koske sotilasilmailua."},{"question":"What is the most logical next event?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the price of aluminium cans decreases happens, how will it affect less aluminium cans are bought. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"If the price of aluminum cans decreases, it might lead to a situation where less aluminum cans are bought. This could have both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process. Direct effect: A decrease in the demand for aluminum cans might lead to a reduction in the supply of used cans for recycling. This could result in a decreased need for recycling services, potentially impacting the revenue of recycling facilities and affecting their operations. Indirect effect: With less aluminum cans being bought, there might be a shift in consumer preference towards alternative packaging materials, such as plastic, glass, or paper-based products. This shift in demand could cause a change in the recycling industry, with facilities needing to adjust their processes to handle a different mix of materials. Additionally, it might trigger investments in the recycling infrastructure for these alternative materials, further affecting the aluminum recycling process. Overall, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process. These effects could alter the need for aluminum recycling services, the revenue of recycling facilities, and the investment in recycling infrastructure and technologies."},{"question":"euromillions lottery numbers - tuesday 5 january 2016 Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","response":"EuroMillions lottery numbers - Tuesday 5 January 2016"},{"question":"Question: What branch of the Uralic language family does Estonian belong to?

Solve this instance: Passage: Four of the men deserted when they reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including Jean L'Archeveque, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, made their way to Illinois Country. During their journey through Illinois to Canada, the men did not tell anyone that La Salle was dead. They reached France in the summer of 1688 and informed King Louis of La Salle's death and the horrible conditions in the colony. Louis did not send aid.

After rocks have split due to the freeze-thaw action, gravity, water flow, and other natural forces come into play, causing the broken pieces of rock to move, disintegrate, and erode. This can lead to various geological formations, such as rockfalls, landslides, or debris accumulation in rivers and streams. Additionally, weathering processes like chemical weathering or biological weathering continue to break down the rock fragments into smaller particles, eventually turning them into soil. During this erosion process, the initial rock fragments can be transported large distances from their original location by water, wind, ice, and other natural agents. These fragments may then become part of sedimentary deposits in various geological environments, such as alluvial fans, riverbeds, or beaches. The smaller particles, like sand, silt, and clay, can mix with dead organic matter to create fertile soil, which further fuels plant growth and contributes to the natural landscape. Over extended periods, these transported rock fragments can undergo additional geological processes, such as lithification, which transforms sedimentary deposits into sedimentary rocks, and metamorphism, which alters the structure and mineral composition of pre-existing rocks due to heat and pressure. These new rock formations can then become exposed to the surface and start the weathering cycle anew. In summary, the final step of the process where water enters the cracks in rocks, freezes into ice, expands and splits the rocks, is the disintegration and erosion of the rocks. This leads to the movement and transformation of the rock fragments, enabling the creation of geological formations, sedimentary deposits, and soil, thus shaping the landscape and playing an essential role in the Earth's geological cycles."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine.

Hypothesis: A young man shaving while looking in the mirror .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Based on the premise, we can analyze the situation and derive a more detailed conclusion for the hypothesis. Premise: A young shirtless man with glasses shaving in a mirror. First, let's break down the premise into its main components: 1. A young man: This indicates that the individual in question is a male, likely in his teens or early twenties. 2. Shirtless: The man in the scenario is not wearing a shirt, suggesting that he might be in a private space like a bathroom, which is a common setting for shaving. 3. With glasses: This detail implies that the man has some form of vision impairment and needs glasses to see properly. This is particularly important in the context of the premise, as the man will require clear vision when looking in the mirror to shave accurately. 4. Shaving: The main activity happening in the scene is that the man is shaving, probably using a razor and some form of shaving cream or gel, as this is the most common approach to shaving. 5. In a mirror: The presence of the mirror is vital, as it allows the man to observe his progress and precisely shave his facial hair. Hypothesis: A young man shaving while looking in the mirror. Now let's examine the hypothesis in the context of the premise. The hypothesis suggests that there is a young man who is shaving and using a mirror to guide his actions. This aligns well with the premise, as it states that a young, shirtless man is shaving while wearing glasses and looking in a mirror. By comparing the hypothesis with the premise, we can observe that the main elements present in both situations are harmonious. The young man is present in both, he is engaged in the act of shaving, and a mirror is used to assist him in this action. The only detail not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis is that the man is shirtless and wearing glasses. However, these specific details do not conflict with the hypothesis nor do they alter the core components of the situation. Therefore, taking this analysis into consideration and acknowledging the consistency between the two descriptions, we can conclude that the hypothesis aligns with the premise. The hypothesis accurately conveys the essential components of the premise, with the only difference being that it omits the mention of the man being shirtless and wearing glasses. Nevertheless, this omission does not undermine or contradict the hypothesis' central point – that a young man is shaving while looking in the mirror."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given four sentences of a story written in natural language, and one last sentence (Sentence5).

This was the message from a leading cancer charity, expressing concerns about the lack of focus and subsequent resources allocated towards understanding, diagnosing, and treating primary bone cancer. The Nature of Primary Bone Cancer Cancer is a collective term for a group of related diseases where some of the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. In most cases, these rogue cells form a tumor. However, not all cancers form tumors. Bone cancers are rare, comprising less than 1% of all cancers, making primary bone cancers even rarer. Unlike metastatic bone cancer, which begins in other parts of the body and later spreads to the bones, primary bone cancers emanate from the bones themselves. Understanding the Scope Given the rarity of the disease, the spotlight often gravitates towards more widespread and well-known cancers. MRI scans and biopsies usually diagnose primary bone cancer. Unfortunately, by the time these methods capture it, the disease may have already reached an advanced stage, making it more challenging to contain and cure. Early detection leads to a higher survival rate, but lack of awareness and research funding often result in late diagnosis and treatment. Challenges and Barriers The medical community faces numerous challenges in dealing with primary bone cancer, given its complexity and rarity. These challenges include but are not limited to a lack of awareness, funding, and research resources. Experts believe that these factors contribute to the paucity of knowledge of the cancer type, leading to delayed diagnoses and suboptimal treatment methods. The cancer charity highlighted that the shortage of funding allocated to primary bone cancer research adversely affects the advancement of effective treatment methods. Moreover, the under-profiling of the disease has resulted in a lack of awareness among healthcare professionals and the public, which further contributes to the delay in detecting and treating the disease effectively. The Value of Funding and Public Awareness Increasing funding for primary bone cancer research is an essential step toward improving our understanding, aiding early detection, and developing more effective treatment strategies. The charity stressed that advances in genomics, immunotherapy, and precision medicine, which have revolutionized treatment for other types of cancers, could have considerable potential in combating primary bone cancer, but such developments require significant research funding. Public awareness campaigns also play a crucial role in combatting primary bone cancer. They can help improve understanding of the disease's symptoms, leading to earlier detection and consequently better chances of survival. Conclusion Despite its rarity, the impact of primary bone cancer on patients and their families is overwhelming. The call to action by the cancer charity provides an opportunity for healthcare providers, the scientific community, and the public to shed light on this under-profiled, under-funded disease. Investing more time, resources, and attention into primary bone cancer is not just an act of goodwill or charity; it is an imperative. It will allow us to develop efficient treatment methods, improve survival rates, enhance patient care, and perhaps, ultimately we can convert what is currently a life-altering diagnosis into a manageable condition. The potential to transform outcomes for primary bone cancer patients is tremendous, but our efforts must be likely matched. This can only happen when society begins viewing primary bone cancer with the recognition and funding it rightly deserves."},{"question":"Question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program. Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I... What was the likely reason for Mike Pompeo's visit to Pyongyang? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Making preparations for Trump's upcoming meeting with Kim - He needed to travel there before being confirmed as Secretary of State - To discuss the sanctions on North Korea Answer:","response":"Making preparations for Trump's upcoming meeting with Kim Mike Pompeo's visit to Pyongyang likely served as a preparation for the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. As the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee at the time, Pompeo's visit would have allowed for essential discussions and coordination with Kim Jong Un before the anticipated summit. The visit exemplified that the U.S. is making an effort to ensure that the meeting progresses smoothly and constructively. By holding high-level talks between the two administrations, it paves the way for a better understanding of each other's positions and possible concessions that might be explored during the Trump-Kim summit. This diplomatic move also demonstrated a level of goodwill and commitment from the U.S. side to engage with the North Korean government and work towards a potential deal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula."},{"question":"Translate \\"Price of the flat from CZK 4.5 million to 5 million\\" to Czech?","response":"Dobře, rád ti pomohu!

Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion. Paragraph: David wanted to test the theory of Einstein. To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B. He was amazed by the counter intuitive results he got from the experiment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: According to Einstein, would case B perceive the distance shorter or longer than case A?","response":"According to Einstein's theory of relativity, as an object's speed increases, its perception of time slows down and the distances it perceives shorten. In the given scenario, the airline pilot in case A is traveling at a much faster speed than the semi truck driver in case B, covering the same distance. Now, according to Einstein's theory, the faster an object moves, the more time dilation and length contraction it experiences. The airline pilot in case A, being the faster traveler, would experience a greater degree of time dilation and length contraction as compared to the semi truck driver in case B. Therefore, according to Einstein, the pilot in case A would perceive the distance to be shorter than the semi truck driver in case B. The semi truck driver (case B) would perceive the distance to be longer in comparison to case A, as he is traveling at a slower speed and experiences less time dilation and length contraction effects."},{"question":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: conceal, grass, leopard","response":"A leopard likes to hide, or \\"conceal\\" itself, in the tall green grass so it can sneak up on its food, just like playing hide and seek!"},{"question":"CHAPTER VI A DEAL IN LAND On the morning after the corporal's discovery, Gustave Wandle was leading his team to a drinking pool on the creek that crossed his farm. He was a big, reserved, fair-haired man, with a fleshy face that was redeemed from heaviness by his eyes, which were restless and keen. Though supposed to be an Austrian, little was known about him or his antecedents except that he owned the next half-section of land to Jernyngham's and farmed it successfully. It was, however, believed that he was of an unusually grasping nature, and his neighbors took precautions when they made a deal with him. He had reached the shadow of a poplar bluff when he heard hurried footsteps and a man with a hot face came into sight. \\"I'm going across your place to save time; I want my horse,\\" he explained hastily. \\"Curtis, the policeman, has ridden in to the settlement and told me to go up and search a muskeg near the north trail with Stanton. Somebody's killed Jernyngham and hidden him there.\\" \\"So!\\" exclaimed Wandle. \\"Jernyngham murdered! You tell me that?\\" \\"Sure thing!\\" the other replied. \\"The police have figured out how it all happened and I'm going to look for the body while Curtis reports to his bosses. A blamed pity! I liked Jernyngham. Well, I must get to the muskeg soon as I can!\\" He ran on, and Wandle led his horses to the pool and stood thinking hard while they drank. He was well versed in Jernyngham's affairs and knew that he had once bought a cheap quarter-section of land in an arid belt some distance off. A railroad had since entered the district, irrigation work had been begun, and the holding must have risen in value. Now, it seemed, Jernyngham was dead, which was unfortunate, because Wandle had found their joint operations profitable, and it was very probable that Ellice and himself were the only persons who knew about the land. Wandle mounted one of the horses and set out for Jernyngham's homestead at its fastest pace. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who was murdered? 2.

R., was the leader of Sri Lanka from 1977 to 1989, serving as Prime Minister from 1977 to 1978 and as the second President of Sri Lanka from 1978 till 1989. He was a leader of the nationalist movement in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) who served in a variety of cabinet positions in the decades following independence. Context: On the economic front, Jayewardene's legacy was decisive. For thirty years after independence, Sri Lanka had struggled in vain with slow growth and high unemployment. Since Jayewardene's reforms, the island has maintained healthy growth despite the civil war. On the ethnic question, Jayewardene's legacy is bitterly divisive. When he took office, ethnic tensions were present but the country as a whole was at peace. By the end of his tenure, Sri Lanka was facing not one but two civil wars, both featuring unprecedented levels of violence and brutality. Though Jayewardene indeed did not take measures to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, a member of an elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is quite clear that he was not a racist but rather a man who knew how to exploit racism to win the majority. Highly respected in Japan for his call for peace and reconciliation with post-war Japan at the Peace Conference in San Francisco in 1951, a statue of Jayewardene was erected at the Kamakura Temple in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan in his honor. In 1988, the J.R Jayewardene Centre was established by the J.R Jayewardene Centre Act No. 77 of 1988 by Parliament at the childhood home of J. R. Jayewardene Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo. It serves as archive for J.R Jayewardene's personal library and papers as well as papers, records from the Presidential Secretariat and gifts he received in his tenure as President. Question: wdid he receive any honors? Answer:","response":"Yes, J.R. Jayewardene received several honors in his lifetime. Some notable honors include: 1. Being highly respected in Japan for his call for peace and reconciliation with post-war Japan at the Peace Conference in San Francisco in 1951. In recognition of this, a statue of Jayewardene was erected at the Kamakura Temple in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, in his honor. 2. In 1988, the J.R. Jayewardene Centre was established by the J.R.

Usage: X = slice, Y = monetary. This is the input to the task and requires no interpretation. Part #2: Determine if there is a HYPER relationship between them. Usage: X is a specific instance of Y, which means X would be a specific type of Y. In this case, \\"slice\\" is not a specific instance of \\"monetary,\\" so there's no HYPER relationship. Part #3: Determine if there's a COORD relationship between the words. Usage: X and Y belong to the same semantic class. In this case, \\"slice\\" refers to a portion of something, and \\"monetary\\" relates to money and financial matters. These words are not in the same semantic class, so there's no COORD relationship. Part #4: Determine if the relationship is RANDOM.

The oldest record of written history dates from Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his \\"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\\" (c. 155053) in XIVXV. Another version was published in 1634, by Giambattista Basile with the title \\"Cagliuso\\". The tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (16281703), a retired civil servant and member of the \\"Académie française\\". The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\\". The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's \\"Histoires\\" has had considerable impact on world culture.

The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \\"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \\"Puss in Boots\\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries.

But most of those in attendance expected McGroarty to show up. Kevin McGroarty died Tuesday and his cremated remains were interred Monday afternoon at, as he called it in his self-written obituary, his new home at Mt. Olivet Cemetery. His cousin, Bill McGroarty, offered what Kevin might have thought about the packed church at his funeral. “He would ask, ‘Don’t all these people have something better to do today?’” Bill said. Monday’s service was filled with emotion — genuine grief and sadness over losing “everybody’s best friend.” There was humor, as you would expect, but the overall tone was a group-shared sense of extreme loss. But it was McGroarty’s obituary, written by him a year ago, according to his closest friends, that jettisoned McGroarty to his 15 minutes of fame following his death. For example, McGroarty wrote: “McGroarty Achieves Room Temperature! “Kevin J. McGroarty, 53, of West Pittston, died Tuesday, July 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy. “He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brothers movies.” Just a sampling of the wit and humor of McGroarty, who was a self-described “veteran of the advertising industry.” Big man, bigger heart Tim Yurek was charged with delivering the eulogy at Monday’s service. As Yurek struggled with emotion, fighting back tears, he managed to paint a clear picture of the man most in attendance knew, but many — especially those who read his obituary — wished they had known. The Rev. Paul McDonnell, a longtime friend of McGroarty’s, conducted the service and he, too, offered touching remarks about a man who literally and figuratively was larger than life. McDonnell described McGroarty as a “big man with a big heart.” “He brought so much joy into our lives,” he said. “His obituary has become the talk of the town — well, the talk of the country actually.” McDonnell said some are probably wondering if McGroarty really did die. “Could he have faked his death?” McDonnell asked. “We gathered here today know that, unfortunately, is not true.” McDonnell said McGroarty was a man of faith who flew in the face of an angry world. “Kevin reminds us of what life is truly about,” he said. “Kevin made us laugh. He wanted us to love one another. I read in the newspaper that somebody rated this area as the unhappiest. Whoever said that never met Kevin McGroarty. The best way to remember Kevin is to imitate his life. Be good to each other every day.” Yurek stepped to the podium and took a deep breath. He said his goal was to honor McGroarty’s life. “He was George Bailey from ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’” Yurek said. “He didn’t have a lot of money, but he was the richest guy in town.” Yurek said McGroarty was an adoring son and a loving brother who had impeccable penmanship. “And he was an incredible friend,” Yurek said. “Kevin was the person you called when you needed someone to talk to — a shoulder to cry on, to share successes with. He was a good listener.” A cell phone went off in church and Yurek said, “Get that, it’s probably Kevin.” Yurek said you could trust McGroarty with a secret or a million dollars. He admitted his faults and was well-aware of his blessings. But Yurek said, McGroarty was a boy from Wyoming — the town he grew up in and loved. “He cherished his roots,” Yurek said. “His passing leaves a huge hole.” In 2012, with the talk of the end of the world soon to come, Yurek said McGroarty posted this on Facebook: “No matter how it comes, it’s been a great ride. I’ve enjoyed every minute of it. Adios to those I love; you know who you are.” With that, Yurek ended his eulogy with, “Adios, Kevin.” As McGroarty’s urn was taken from the church, with his family and friends following, “When Irish Eyes Were Smiling” played in the background. Later in the day, three of his closest friends — Sam Rizzo, Dave Fusco and Jim Dellarte — fought back tears at Pat Patte’s Sports Bar and they talked about their late friend and his zest for life. “There are a lot of life lessons to be learned from the way Kevin led his life,” Rizzo, 53, said. Noting good deeds The three talked about McGroarty and his almost uncontrollable penchant for helping/rewarding those less fortunate and those who performed random acts of kindness, like the time in Las Vegas when a vagrant approached Rizzo and McGroarty and others asking for a couple of bucks. Nobody responded, except McGroarty. “He handed the guy a fifty dollar bill,” Rizzo said. “And he asked the vagrant to promise him that he would have at least a sandwich and not spend it all on booze.” Rizzo asked McGroarty why he did that and his response was, “Someday that might be me.” And then at Grotto Harveys Lake, a group came in after an afternoon of boating. They had their valuables in a bag that they set on the floor. When they were leaving, they forgot the bag and two young women grabbed it and ran after the people to return it. “Kevin asked the waitress for their bill and he paid it,” Dellarte said. ” The waitress asked who shall I say paid the bill and Kevin told her it didn’t matter; that they didn’t know each other. The waitress asked why he would pay their bill and Kevin just said that he saw them do a nice deed for someone.” Fusco said his daughter broke her ankle and was in the hospital for surgery. When Kevin found out, he would send her flowers, candy, gifts every day. “That was Kevin,” he said. “That’s where his heart was.” Earlier in the day, the three friends greeted all of the visitors at church. They were amazed at the number of people who they didn’t know, but who knew Kevin. And there were several people who only knew him from his obituary. “One man told me he never met Kevin, but he read his obituary and he wanted to come and see what he was all about.” Fusco visited McGroarty on the night before he died. It was 9:30 p.m. “He told me he didn’t receive guests after 9 p.m.,” Fusco said. “Now get out of here, he told me.” Fusco, Rizzo and Dellarte laughed — and cried. They said they already miss their friend. And, they said, they always will. ||||| Leave it to an ad guy to write his own hilariously entertaining obituary, and have it go viral in the days after his death. Kevin J. McGroarty, who died last Tuesday at age 53, had worked in advertising since 1983 and ran Rhino Media in West Pittston, Pa., until 2006, according to the obituary in the Wilkes Barre Times Leader—a 500-word mini masterpiece that gets off to a flying start with the line: \\"McGroarty achieves room temperature!\\" Every paragraph is amusing, though the high points include: • He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances. • McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\" • He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\" • A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence.

Edward M. McGroarty and Helen Jane (Hudson) McGroarty, whom the New York Times should have noted as extraordinary parents. He was baptized at St. Cecilia Church, Exeter, which later burned to the ground, attended Butler Street Elementary, which was later torn down, and middle school at 6th Street in Wyoming, now an apartment building. He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brother's movies. He led a crusade to promote area midget wrestling, and in his youth was noted for his many unsanctioned daredevil stunts. He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances. McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\" McGroarty was a veteran of the advertising industry since 1983. McGroarty was a pioneer in Apple computing, purchasing one of the first in the Wyoming Valley in 1985. He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\" McGroarty was a founding partner of Pyramid Advertising, and finally principal owner of award-winning Rhino Media until 2006. He was also an adjunct instructor at Luzerne County Community College, from 2005-2009. He will be laid to rest at Mount Olivet Cemetery, section 7N. He asks to please make note of his new address. McGroarty's headstone reads: \\"I'll Be Right Back,\\" one of his favorite sayings. He leaves this world with few regrets, one being told in grade school, his adult life would see the Hershey candy bar rise in cost to over a dollar. He maintained given the resources and initiative, he would rally the good citizens of the Commonwealth to a revolution that would force that price to its original 35-cent market value, a dream he was not able to fulfill, by his own admission the reason: \\"I was distracted by many beautiful women.\\" In lieu of flowers, friends are asked to please give generously to the Pennsylvania State Police Troop \\"P\\" Camp Cadet Fund. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence. This will be presented by his attorney, Bret Zankel, Esq. Friends may call from 9 to 10 a.m. Monday in the church. McGroarty leaves behind a thought for all to ponder, given years of gathering wisdom from different religions and deep study of the Greek philosophers: \\"It costs nothing to be nice\\" and \\"Never stick a steak knife in an electrical outlet.\\" Arrangements by the Metcalfe-Shaver-Kopcza Funeral Home Inc., 504 Wyoming Ave., Wyoming. |||||Summary:","response":"Kevin McGroarty's funeral took place at St. Cecelia's Church, where 300 people came to say their goodbyes. His cousin, Bill McGroarty, imagined what Kevin might have thought about the packed audience: \\"Don't all these people have something better to do today?\\" The service was full of emotion and humor, reflecting the personality and wit of the man whose self-written obituary brought him fame posthumously. Eulogist Tim Yurek managed to paint a clear picture of the man that many admired and wished they had known. The Reverend Paul McDonnell, a longtime friend, described Kevin as a \\"big man with a big heart\\" who brought joy into people's lives and reminded everyone to love one another. While Kevin left no known children, he touched the lives of many and will not be forgotten. His obituary achieved viral success with its perfect blend of wit and humor, often poking fun at himself and his life experiences. From listing unusual names he might have given his hypothetical children to sarcastically requesting not to be emailed because he's dead, Kevin McGroarty's obituary captivated the hearts of readers across the country. He even included amusing lines in the details for his Mass of Christian Burial, asking mourners to attend a brief rant about how the government ruined Bugs Bunny cartoons through censorship. His final piece of advice in the obituary? \\"It costs nothing to be nice\\" and \\"Never stick a steak knife in an electrical outlet.\\" His ability to entertain both in life and after death leaves a long-lasting legacy."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: FOX411's pic of the day Has Courtney gone too far?

Title:","response":"Celebrity Highlights: Outrageous Outfits, Royal Spotlight Stealers, and Glamorous Gatherings"},{"question":"Is the following review positive or negative? I ordered pizza for myself and my two sons last night and wasn't disappointed in the quality at all. We got pizza, wings, and I got a slice of cheesecake to indulge in after they went to bed. All were tasty. My only complaint is that it took over an hour and a half for the delivery. If I had known that, I would have probably called a different establishment. By the time the food got to us, I had two very cranky children and I was quite cranky myself. Hoping for a better delivery experience next time around.","response":"The review given can be considered as a mix of positive and negative. On the positive side, the reviewer is satisfied with the quality of the food they ordered. They mention that the pizza, wings, and cheesecake were all tasty, indicating an overall satisfaction with the meal. The fact that they were happy with the actual food items suggests that they enjoyed their dining experience in terms of taste and quality. However, on the negative side, the reviewer has a major complaint regarding the delivery time. They mention that it took over an hour and a half for the food to be delivered to them, which clearly had a negative impact on their overall experience. This long wait time led to frustration and crankiness in both the reviewer and their children. The reviewer also states that if they had known in advance about the delivery time, they would have chosen a different establishment, which further implies their dissatisfaction with this particular aspect of the service. In conclusion, this review contains both positive and negative elements. While the reviewer seems satisfied with the quality and taste of the food itself, the poor delivery experience detracted from their overall enjoyment. This mix of sentiments might provide valuable feedback for the restaurant to improve its services, particularly in terms of delivery time. The reviewer also expresses hope for a better delivery experience in the future, indicating that they may be willing to give the establishment another chance."},{"question":"Q:Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003. Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\" Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union. In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped. In November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection.

She admits that it was her carelessness that led to the ink stains and assures Kayla that she will do her best to clean it. Wanting to show genuine remorse, Lindsey searches for solutions to remove ink stains from Kayla's purse effectively. She spends time researching different methods to clean the specific type of material the purse is made of, whether it is leather, fabric, or a synthetic material. After gathering the required information, Lindsey prepares the necessary cleaning solution. For instance, if the purse is made of leather, Lindsey might use a combination of rubbing alcohol or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, a cotton swab, and a clean cloth to remove the stains. If the purse is made of fabric, she might use a mix of water, white vinegar, and dish soap to clean the stains. In case the purse is made of synthetic material, Lindsey could use a non-acetone nail polish remover to clean the affected area.

Once confident that the cleaning solution is suitable, she treats the ink-stained area with great care, using moderate pressure to avoid damaging it.

Both questions are asking to identify the best moment or happening in a person's life. While the wording is slightly different, the core meaning and intention behind the questions remain the same. The person being asked these questions would likely interpret them as inquiries about the most noteworthy, positive, or fulfilling event in their life. In most cases, the answer to these two questions would indeed be the same, as they both seek to uncover an individual's most cherished memory or experience. However, it is essential to keep in mind that each person is different, and their interpretation of the questions may vary based on their personal recollections and perspectives. Some individuals might provide slightly different answers due to their unique interpretation of these questions. Furthermore, individuals might choose to focus on different aspects of their lives when answering these questions.

M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan and Barrie's own novelization of it, Peter and Wendy. The music is mostly by Mark \\"Moose\\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. The Jolly Roger Hook revels in his success (\\"Hook's Waltz\\"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the \\"doodle-doo\\" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (\\"I've Gotta Crow\\" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (\\"I Gotta Crow\\" [2nd reprise]). Back home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (\\"Tender Shepherd\\" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (\\"We Will Grow Up\\"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her. Years pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, \\"Boy, why are you crying?\\" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, \\"Oh, if only I could go with you!\\" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, \\"You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up\\". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, \\"just for Spring cleaning.\\" Her daughter and the \\"boy who wouldn't grow up\\" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window.

It follows a string of similar cases - in Ferguson, Missouri, for example, where police shot dead an unarmed black teenager in August last year, or, more recently, in South Carolina, where a white officer shot another unarmed black man five times as he was running away. Each time something like this happens, it raises the same question with ever increasing urgency: can the law offer justice to black Americans? Ms Lynch seems peculiarly well-placed to provide the answer. She was born in North Carolina in 1959, so into a world where law and justice were most certainly not the same thing. In the early 1960s, life in the American South was still dominated by the so-called \\"Jim Crow\\" laws - legislation introduced after the American Civil War to segregate white people and black people. Despite that, her father, the Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, a Protestant pastor like his father before him, believed the law could be a force for change. And when the future attorney general was a very young girl, he used to take her down to the local law courts. \\"When I was growing up we were taught [to] stay away from the courthouse,\\" he told me. \\"Don't be caught at the courthouse. [But] I thought it was a positive institution, and I wanted her to have a different view of it.\\" The Jim Crow laws finally went in the mid-1960s, but casual racism remained. The \\"Jim Crow\\" laws were used to segregate white people and black people in parts of the United States until the 1960s and covered all aspects of life including: Ms Lynch's mother, Lorine, remembers that her daughter's teachers had trouble accepting how clever she was. When she was in the second grade - so seven or eight years old - she had to retake a class test because she did so well the first time round. \\"[The teachers] felt it was not accurate because she was African-American and all the white students scored lower,\\" Mrs Lynch told me. Her score was even higher second time round. None of this seems to have blunted her aspirations. Ms Lynch pursued a childhood dream of going to Harvard - America's oldest institution of higher education - where she completed a first degree in English literature before switching to law. A student radical she was not. Karen Freeman-Wilson, now a mayor in Indiana, was a member of the same sorority (a student club for women) and remembers how smartly turned-out she always was. \\"In college you tend to wear jeans, you tend to wear khakis, you tend to dress down,\\" she says, \\"but I can't remember an occasion that Loretta dressed down. I used to tease her... 'Do you ever have any play clothes?'\\" The sharply dressed lawyer of the future was already in the making. The big New York law firms were still very male and very white when she joined Cahill Gordon and Reindel in the mid-1980s. Two other black American women were part of her cohort, and the three liked to refer to themselves as \\"the triplets\\". One of them, Alysa Christmas Rollock, who is now a vice-president at Purdue University in Indiana, told me they used the nickname because the firm's receptionists, who knew the 250 male partners and associates by name, seemed to be \\"incapable of identifying us from each other, so we became the non-identical triplets\\". The slight must have been - to put it at its mildest - irritating, but there seems no evidence Ms Lynch resented the racism she faced. Those we spoke to for BBC Radio Four's Profile programme said she lacked any trace of bitterness. We can restore trust and faith both in our laws and in those of us who enforce them Her first really high-profile case - in 1999, not long after the then President, Bill Clinton, appointed her the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York - raised just the issues that are back in the spotlight as she takes on her new job. Abner Louima, a Haitian, had been arrested after an altercation outside a nightclub and accused of hitting a police officer. The police later admitted the charge was false, but Mr Louima was brutally beaten. During the trial it emerged one of the police officers involved was in a long-term relationship with a black American woman, and it was put to the court he was therefore unlikely to have violated the rights of a black man. Alan Vinegrad, who worked with Ms Lynch on the case, remembers the way she tackled this sensitive issue head on, accusing the officer concerned of \\"hiding behind the colour of his girlfriend's skin\\". It was high-stakes stuff - the trial team had to be escorted out of the courtroom by US marshals that day - but it was done in a \\"calm and measured way\\". Ms Lynch's ability to stay calm stood her in good stead when she faced rough questioning during her confirmation hearings. \\"Many of us looked at the treatment she receivedâ€¦ [and] we didn't feel good about it, we did not feel there was a sense of fairness,\\" her old friend, Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, said. \\"But her reaction was, 'That's OK, let's just keep our heads and eyes on the prize.' That's who she really is.\\" She is also - and everyone seems to agree on this - a formidably good lawyer, a \\"consummate professional\\" in the judgement of one of those who worked with her. She will need all of those qualities if she is to restore faith in US justice. Listen to the latest edition of BBC Radio 4's Profile programme or download the podcast.

Her first high-profile case involved the false arrest and brutal beating of Haitian Abner Louima by police officers. Lynch's ability to stay calm during difficult situations enabled her to succeed during her confirmation hearings.

Answer:","response":"To answer the question of who has performed in more bands, Paul Rodgers or Rob Beckley, we must first explore each musician's history of their respective bands and musical associations. Paul Rodgers is a renowned English singer, songwriter, and musician. He has made a substantial contribution to the world of music through his powerful voice and songwriting prowess. His career took off during the late 1960s and he has remained active in the music scene ever since. Here is a breakdown of the prominent bands and projects Paul Rodgers has been a part of: 1. Free (1968-1973) - Forming the band Free allowed Rodgers to gain fame as a rock vocalist. Known for the hit song \\"All Right Now,\\" Free remained active until its disbandment in 1973. 2. Bad Company (1973-1982, 1998-2002, 2008-2010) – After Free's breakup, Rodgers formed Bad Company with Mott the Hoople's guitarist, Mick Ralphs. With major hits like \\"Feel Like Making Love\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough,\\" Bad Company enjoyed tremendous success and influence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Rodgers left the band in 1982 but later re-formed and played with them again between 1998-2002 and 2008-2010. 3. The Firm (1984-1986) – Rodgers teamed up with Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page, to form The Firm, which lasted for two years and produced two albums. 4. The Law (1991-1992) – A collaboration with ex-Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones led to the formation of this brief rock duo who released just one album. 5. Rodgers recently embarked on a solo career and released several solo albums from the 1980s onwards. 6. Queen + Paul Rodgers (2004-2009) – In 2004, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen invited Rodgers to be the band's frontman. This collaboration resulted in the project “Queen + Paul Rodgers”. The trio released an album, \\"The Cosmos Rocks,\\" and performed on a global tour. Rob Beckley, on the other hand, is an American singer and guitarist known for his work in the Christian rock genre. His bands and projects include: 1. Pillar (1998-present) - Beckley is the lead vocalist and founding member of this Christian rock band formed in 1998. Pillar has released multiple albums to date, garnering positive reception in the Christian rock scene. 2. Beckley has also contributed to some side projects and collaborations within the Christian music community. If we compare the two musicians, it becomes evident that Paul Rodgers has performed in more bands than Rob Beckley. Paul Rodgers has been associated with at least six diverse musical projects, including Free, Bad Company, The Firm, The Law, his solo career, and Queen + Paul Rodgers. In contrast, Rob Beckley has mainly performed with Pillar alongside a few side projects. Therefore, Paul Rodgers has been a part of more bands and associations throughout his musical career compared to Rob Beckley."},{"question":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Test yourself. This will help you to understand as well as learn faster because it is more active than reading or listening. It will also help you to notice your mistakes and the topics you have trouble understanding. Take Fuller Notes Notes should be in your own words, brief and clear. They should be tidy and easy to read. Writing notes will help you better than just underlining as you read, since it forces you to rewrite ideas in your own words. Study the Middle The best time to review is soon after you've learned something. You are more likely to remember the material at the beginning and the end of the lesson, so make sure you focus on the middle when you review. Sleep On It Study before going to bed, unless you are very tired. It's easier to remember material you've just learned after sleeping than after an equal period of daytime activity, because your brain continues to think even after you've fallen asleep. Combine Memory and Understanding There are two ways to remember: by memorizing and by understanding. Multiplication tables, telephone numbers, and math formulas are better learned by rote. Ideas are best learned by understanding. The more ways you have to think about an idea, the more meaning it will have; the more meaningful the learning, the better you can remember it. Pay attention to similarities in ideas and concepts, and then try to understand how they fit in with things you already know. Never be satisfied with anything less than a completely clear understanding of what you are reading. If you are not able to follow the thought, go back to the place where you first got confused and try again.

By Reuters Reporter and Ap Reporter A federal judge has thrown out over 12 million in punitive damages awarded to billionaire William Koch in his lawsuit accusing a fellow oenophile of selling him 24 bottles of fake Bordeaux and reduced the award to 711,622. U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan agreed Monday with the defendant, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Eric Greenberg, that the jury's April 2013 award was 'exorbitant', being more than 33 times the 355,811 it awarded in compensatory damages. Oetken also lowered those damages to 212,699, reflecting Koch's prior settlement with Zachys Wine Auctions Inc, reducing the total award to 924,321 from nearly 12.4 million. Oetken said punitive damages equal to two times compensatory damages would punish","response":"Greenberg sufficiently and deter others from committing similar wrongful acts in the future. The principle behind awarding punitive damages is not to enrich the plaintiff but to penalize the wrongdoer and prevent similar conduct in the future. Balancing the need for punishment and deterrence against the actual harm caused, a ratio of 2:1 strikes an equitable balance in this case, in accordance with the applicable legal standards. In reaching this decision, Judge Oetken considered various factors such as the reprehensibility of Greenberg's conduct, the harm caused to Koch, and the proportionality of the punitive damages award in relation to the compensatory damages. He ruled that the jury's initial award of punitive damages was excessive and violated due process, as it was not justified by the degree of reprehensibility of Greenberg's behavior or the actual harm suffered by Koch. The judge acknowledged that Greenberg's actions in selling counterfeit wine were serious and caused considerable harm to Koch, particularly given the prominence of Koch as a collector and investor in the field of wine. However, the court also took into account that Greenberg did not have a previous history of similar misconduct and that the harm caused to Koch was primarily economic, rather than physical or emotional. Furthermore, Judge Oetken noted that by reducing the compensatory damages awarded to Koch, the original ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages would no longer be appropriate. Using the new reduced compensatory damages figure of 212,699, applying a 2:1 ratio results in a punitive damages award of 425,398. Judge Oetken thus revised the entire damages award as follows: compensatory damages of 212,699 and punitive damages of 425,398, leading to a total award of 638,097. This revised award, the judge determined, not only punished Greenberg but also served as a warning to others who might contemplate engaging in similar fraudulent schemes in the future. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is: \\"Oetken said punitive damages equal to two times compensatory damages would punish Greenberg sufficiently and deter others from committing similar wrongful acts in the future. In this case, after considering various factors, including the proportionality of damages, the revised punitive damages awarded were 425,398, leading to a total award of 638,097.\\""},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Step 2: Identify the relevant part of the premise Since we are trying to analyze if the person has a jaw or not, the important part of the premise to focus on is \\"squarely built to match his jaw.\\" Step 3: Analyze the phrase The phrase \\"squarely built to match his jaw\\" indicates that the person's build is proportional to or resembles their jaw. This means that the person must have a jaw for the comparison to be made in the first place. Step 4: Connect the premise to the hypothesis Since the phrase \\"squarely built to match his jaw\\" establishes that the person has a jaw, we can confidently connect the premise to the hypothesis, which states, \\"He has a jaw.\\" Conclusion: If the premise is true, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis, \\"He has a jaw,\\" is also true."},{"question":"Q: In this task you are given a sentence.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the guidebook, which indicates that their overall experience with the product was unfavorable. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the directions provided in the guidebook were not always accurate, which would be a significant drawback for users relying on the book to navigate around Nashville and Memphis. Inaccurate directions can lead to confusion, time wastage, and frustration for travelers trying to make the most of their trip. Secondly, the reviewer points out that the maps, which they consider to be a vital element of any guidebook, were not very good. Inadequate maps can make it challenging for travelers to locate tourist attractions, accommodations, restaurants, and other essential points of interest. This significantly reduces the effectiveness and value of the guidebook for users.

Komen for the Cure Foundation said in a statement. \\"We will continue to fund existing grants, including those of Planned Parenthood, and preserve their eligibility to apply for future grants, while maintaining the ability of our affiliates to make funding decisions that meet the needs of their communities.\\" The group's earlier decision not to renew part of its longstanding partnership with Planned Parenthood, which operates hundreds of family clinics that perform abortions, triggered strong emotions across the country. It provoked objection even from some of its own affiliates. Planned Parenthood said funding from the Komen foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers. In the last five years, grants from the group have directly supported 170,000 screenings, making up about 4% of the total exams performed at Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide. In Washington, 26 Senate Democrats had signed a letter calling on Komen to reconsider. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime Planned Parenthood supporter, pledged 250,000 in matching grants to help make up for the loss in funding. \\"Politics have no place in health care,\\" the mayor said. \\"Breast cancer screening saves lives, and hundreds of thousands of women rely on Planned Parenthood for access to care. We should be helping women access that care, not placing barriers in their way.\\" Bloomberg's gift came on top of 400,000 that Planned Parenthood reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the initial announcement. By Friday, the group had raised more than 3 million. \\"It's a testament to America's compassion and sincerity,\\" said Barbara Zdravecky, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida. Addressing the controversy, Zdravecky said only about 3% of the group's services provide for abortions, a hot button issue in presidential politics, while the majority of the group's work is based on prevention, screening and family planning. An anonymous donor had also offered 300,000 in matching grant money earlier this week, Zdravecky said. \\"Today, the interests of women's health prevailed over partisan politics,\\" said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-New Jersey). \\"The Komen Foundation did the right thing.\\" Other lawmakers expressed outrage over Friday's announcement. Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers added that the group's \\"original stance to stop funding pending an important congressional investigation was an act of courage and prudence, making their sudden reversal today appear hollow and weak.\\" Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum said he was \\"deeply disappointed \\" in the decision. CREDO, which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to Planned Parenthood, said Thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the Komen Foundation to reverse its decision. \\"The (earlier) move is clearly connected to attempts by Republicans in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood,\\" the organization said in a statement. \\"In responding to questions about its decision, the foundation cited as its rationale a sham 'investigation' into Planned Parenthood launched by Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns,\\" who the group called \\"one of the most militant anti-choice members of Congress.\\" In September, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, on which the Florida congressman sits, began an investigation into Planned Parenthood over the organization's \\"compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions.\\" The group said Tuesday that the Komen Foundation had \\"succumbed to political pressure\\" by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings amid increased scrutiny by Congress over how Planned Parenthood provides abortion services. But the American Life League said in a statement that the foundation's decision was justified. Planned Parenthood \\"is currently the focus of a congressional investigation, and multiple affiliates are under state investigations,\\" it said. \\"Planned Parenthood operatives are lashing out at Komen across the Internet and throughout the media, in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint Komen's policy as cowardly and politically motivated.\\" The Komen Foundation had also denied that its decision stemmed from politics. \\"We've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing,\\" said Nancy Brinker, CEO and founder of the group. In all, grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 Planned Parenthood clinics, she said. \\"We don't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased.\\" Brinker was a political appointee of the George W. Bush administration, in which she served as U.S. ambassador to Hungary and as chief of protocol. Susan G. Komen was Brinker's sister. Komen Foundation President Liz Thompson said the funds would have been redirected \\"to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly.\\" She said there was \\"amazing consensus\\" among foundation board members about the decision, which was made \\"over the better part of two years.\\" That consensus did not include Dr. Kathy Plesser, a member of the foundation's medical advisory board in New York, who had pledged to resign if the decision was not overturned. \\"I cannot as a physician and advocate for women's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction,\\" Plesser said. \\"A big part of what Komen does is reach underserved communities of women.

It doesn't specify the positions of the children, only that they are present with the man.

They talked about what happened and how to feel better. The parents also made some changes at home, like not allowing the kids to play hide-and-seek and putting locks on bedroom doors.

The language introduced is standard throughout the text.","response":"Let's analyze the two sentences step by step to determine if the word \\"language\\" has the same meaning in both: 1. First, let's examine the context and meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"Language sets homo sapiens apart from all other animals.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"language\\" is referring to the ability to communicate using a complex system of words, signals, or symbols that convey meaning. It highlights a uniquely human characteristic, enabling effective communication and understanding among humans. Sentence 2: \\"The language introduced is standard throughout the text.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"language\\" refers to a specific system of communication (e.g., code, syntax, grammar, or terminology) used consistently within a given text. This context implies that there is a particular language that has been selected and applied throughout the text. 2. Now, let's compare the meanings to determine if they are the same. In both sentences, the word \\"language\\" is being used to describe a system of communication that involves words, symbols, or signs to convey meaning. However, the contexts in which the word is used are different: - In the first sentence, \\"language\\" is referring to a broad concept that distinguishes humans from other animals. It encompasses all forms of human language and their respective complexity. - In the second sentence, \\"language\\" is referring to one specific language system used within a particular text, implying a more focused and standardized usage. In conclusion, the underlying concept of a communication system is similar, but the specific meanings and contexts in which the word \\"language\\" is used differ between the two sentences. In the first sentence, it has a broader meaning, referring to the general concept of language, while in the second sentence, it refers to a specific language system used within a particular context."},{"question":"Translate \\"\\"At this moment in time, the EU wants to show Serbian citizens that they are welcome in the EU, and that Serbia is welcome in the EU, and one of the best ways to do this is to slowly liberalise and ultimately normalise the visa regime, and abolish visa requirements for Serbian citizens,\\" Belgrade-based B92 quoted him as saying Monday.\\" to Turkish?","response":"Şu anda, AB Sırp vatandaşlarına ve Sırbistan'a AB'de hoş geldiniz demek istiyor ve bunu yapmanın en iyi yollarından biri, vize rejimini yavaşça gevşetmek ve sonunda Sırp vatandaşları için vize gereksinimlerini ortadan kaldırmaktır.

Article: I recently had dinner with someone who told me that one of his best friends had been killed in a private plane crash, and something happened at the memorial service that he'll never forget. He shared the story with me. At the memorial service, his friend's wife walked to the platform to speak to the gathering. She said a friend had asked her the best memory she had of their life together. At the moment, she had been too sad to answer, but she had thought about it since and wanted to answer the question. They were in their late forties when he died, and she began talking about a time in their life almost twenty years earlier. She had quit her job to obtain her master's degree, and her husband never hesitated in his support. He held down his own job and also did the cooking, cleaning, and other housework while she studied for her degree. One time they both stayed up all night. She was finishing her paper, and he was preparing for an important business meeting. That morning, she walked out of her study, leaned against the door by the stairs, looked at her husband downstairs and just thought about how much she loved him. She knew how important this meeting was to his future, and she was feeling guilty that she didn't even have time to make his breakfast. He took his briefcase and hurried out. She heard the garage door open and close, but much to her surprise, she heard it open again about thirty seconds later. From above, she watched her husband dash into the house and walk over to the forgotten coffee table. Marking the surface of it with his finger through the dust with the words \\"I love you\\", then he raced back to his car.

Elena never seemed to care about others' feelings, only focusing on what she wanted at the moment. Step 1: Understand the story so far - The story talks about Elena and Tanya with regard to a cake. - It specifically points out that Elena always took more cake than Tanya. - Elena's greediness is highlighted in the story. Step 2: Develop the story further - Introduce how Elena's greediness affects her relationship with Tanya. - Bring in other characters and situations to show the consequences of Elena's greediness. - Try to create a situation where Elena might learn a lesson or realize the consequences of her actions. Continuing the story: Tanya, on the other hand, was much more considerate and tried to make sure everyone got a fair share. This led to many disputes between the two friends whenever dessert was involved. Tanya often found herself wondering why Elena was so incredibly selfish when it came to treats. One day, during a birthday party, Elena's greediness reached a boiling point. The birthday boy, Tim, was about to cut the cake when Elena pushed her way to the front and grabbed the biggest slice for herself. The shocked and disappointed expressions on the faces of Tim and the other guests were unmistakable. But Elena, as usual, was rather oblivious to the effect her actions had on others. Tanya had enough. She pulled Elena aside and confronted her about her behavior. Elena, feeling attacked, tried to brush it off, but Tanya remained firm. She explained that if Elena continued to act this way, people would not want to spend time with her, and she risked losing friends, including Tanya herself. For the first time, Elena began to see the consequences of her greedy behavior. It wasn't just about getting a bigger piece of cake; it was about respect, empathy, and the long-term effects her actions had on friendships. As a result, Elena made a conscious effort to change and become a more considerate person, not just for Tanya, but for all the people in her life. The road to change was not easy, but with Tanya's support and the lessons she had learned, Elena was determined to be a better friend and person."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make a salt lick for horses Use salt that is meant for animal consumption. Look for salt made for horses at your local pet store or feed store and buy it in bulk. Check that the salt is not a mineral salt blend, such as red salt, or salt that is meant for de-icing roads.","response":"When you have the appropriate salt, decide on the type of salt lick you would like to create, whether it be a block, loose salt, or a hanging option, and gather necessary materials to construct the salt lick. If you've chosen to make a block, you can use a mold or create one by cutting the top off of a milk carton or similar container and rinsing it thoroughly. Mix the salt with a small amount of water, just enough to form a slushy consistency, and pour this mixture into the mold. Allow the mixture to set for several hours, or until it hardens completely, and then carefully remove the hardened salt lick from its mold. If you prefer a loose salt option, place the salt in a shallow, weather-proof container, such as a plastic tray or bowl, and position it securely in your horse's paddock or stall to prevent it from being knocked over. Alternatively, for a hanging salt lick, drill a hole through the center of a hardened salt block and thread a sturdy rope or chain through the hole. Secure the salt lick to a fence or post within reach of your horse, making sure it is hanging at an appropriate height for easy access. Regularly check and replenish the salt lick, ensuring that it remains clean and free from contaminants, in order to provide your horse with essential nutrients and promote healthy digestion, hydration, and overall wellbeing."},{"question":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will impose tariffs on some textile exports in a move that may ease frictions with the United States and others over an expected flood of Chinese products on world markets after a global quota system expires at year's end.

Esimerkiksi uusien teknologioiden ja menetelmien käyttöönotto voi parantaa kullan tuottamisen tehokkuutta ja vähentää sen ympäristövaikutuksia. Tässä yhteydessä Euroopan komission ja lainsäätäjän tulee tukea tutkimusta ja uusien teknologioiden kehittämistä kultatuotantoalalla. Myös sosiaaliset näkökohdat ovat tärkeitä kultatuotannon kehittämisessä. Kullan tuotanto voi tarjota työpaikkoja ja taloudellista hyvinvointia monille Euroopan alueille, mutta samalla on huolehdittava siitä, että kultasektorin työntekijöiden työolot ja oikeudet pysyvät kunnossa. Tämän saavuttamiseksi Euroopan komission ja lainsäätäjän tulee tehdä yhteistyötä teollisuuden ja työntekijöiden edustajien kanssa. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että kultatuotannon edistäminen on tärkeä tavoite Euroopan unionille, ja vaadimme komissaari Potočnikia sekä muita Euroopan komission jäseniä ja lainsäätäjiä tekemään kaikkensa tämän tavoitteen saavuttamiseksi. Tämä edellyttää ympäristön, tekniikan ja sosiaalisten näkökohtien huomioimista, jotta voidaan varmistaa kestävä ja kannattava kullan tuotanto tulevaisuudessa."},{"question":"Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

Article: FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading...

The two co-stars developed a romantic relationship, and during the shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya, Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A significant portion of the movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses and a loss of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry. Sashadhar Mukherjee, an assistant sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because both of them were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things would never be the same between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode. Despite the additional expense involved in re-shooting many portions of the film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was the period in which actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity. Answer this question \\"What was her family's reaction?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"The text does not provide specific information on Devika Rani's family's reaction to her elopement with Najm-ul-Hassan and subsequent return to her husband. However, it does offer a generally descriptive context of the societal norms during that era in India, mentioning that women who eloped were often regarded as no better than prostitutes and shunned by their own families.

Sentence 2: No one knew he'd escaped from prison during the war. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"If the first sentence is true, stating that \\"His escape from prison during the Mexican War was common knowledge,\\" then it implies that a significant number of people were aware of the man's escape from prison during that time. The second sentence states that \\"No one knew he'd escaped from prison during the war.\\" This implies that there was no public awareness of his escape at all. Based on the information given, the two sentences are seemingly contradicting each other. If we take the first sentence to be true, then there is a strong implication that the second sentence cannot be true. Since \\"common knowledge\\" suggests widespread awareness, claiming that no one knew about his escape would conflict with the information presented in the first sentence. Conversely, if we take the second sentence to be true, then it would mean that the first sentence is false, as the man's escape could not have been common knowledge if nobody knew about it. Therefore, if we assume the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be considered true based on the information given."},{"question":"Article:The former Manchester City striker, 30, scored three in the last 25 minutes to take his European total to eight goals.

Molecular studies place animals in a supergroup called the opisthokonts, which also include the choanoflagellates, fungi and a few small parasitic protists.

It is believed that animals evolved from what?","response":"Animals are believed to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote. Eukaryotes are organisms with complex cells containing a nucleus and organelles, and a flagellated eukaryote refers to a single-celled organism with one or more whip-like appendages called flagella that it uses for motility. The closest known living relatives of animals are the choanoflagellates, which are collared flagellates with a morphology similar to the choanocytes found in certain sponges. Molecular studies have placed animals within a supergroup called the opisthokonts, which, in addition to choanoflagellates, also includes fungi and a few small parasitic protists. The term \\"opisthokont\\" is derived from the location of the flagellum in motile cells, which is typically at the posterior end in animals, such as in most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes generally have anterior flagella. This shared characteristic serves as evidence that animals likely evolved from a common flagellated eukaryotic ancestor, ultimately giving rise to the diverse range of animal species we see today."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"after fertilization and undergoing cell division a gamete becomes a(n)?\\" is \\"grow\\", given that after fertilization of gametes it undergoes cell division to become an embryo? Select from: a. Yes; b. No; Answer:","response":"b. No The right answer to the question \\"after fertilization and undergoing cell division a gamete becomes a(n)?\\" is not \\"grow.\\" The process of fertilization involves the fusion of two haploid gametes (sperm and egg cells) to form a diploid zygote. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of cell divisions through a process called cleavage, which eventually leads to the formation of an embryo. The statement \\"after fertilization of gametes, it undergoes cell division to become an embryo\\" is accurate, but the word \\"grow\\" does not fit in the context of identifying what the gamete becomes after fertilization and cell division. Instead, a more suitable word or term under this context would be \\"zygote\\" or \\"embryo.\\" In summary, after fertilization and undergoing cell division, a gamete becomes a zygote, which subsequently forms an embryo through further cell divisions and developmental processes.

The given equation is: 1126*z - 956*z = 726 + 1824 Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms. On the left side, we have two terms containing \\"z\\", and on the right side, we have two constant terms. Let's start by combining the terms with \\"z\\" on the left side: (1126 - 956)*z = 170*z Now, let's combine the constants on the right side: 726 + 1824 = 2550 The simplified equation becomes: 170*z = 2550 Step 2: Solve for z. To find the value of z, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In this case, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of z (which is 170): 170*z = 2550 (170*z) / 170 = 2550 / 170 z = 15 So, the solution for the equation 1126*z - 956*z = 726 + 1824 is z = 15."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Manchester United earned £60.8m and were featured live 25 times.

The figures will rocket next season when BT Sport joins the party.","response":"Title: The Lucrative World of Football Broadcasting: Manchester United Tops the Earnings Chart Introduction The English football landscape has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with broadcasting revenue becoming a critical component of clubs' financial structures. The advent of pay-per-view television and the proliferation of digital platforms have driven football clubs to explore new avenues for maximizing their broadcast earnings. In this article, we will delve into the recent broadcasting revenue figures of popular English football clubs, focusing on the staggering difference in earnings between clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, and QPR. Manchester United's Impressive Earnings Manchester United, one of the most successful English football clubs, has set a new benchmark in broadcasting revenue. During the recent season, the Red Devils raked in an astonishing £60.8 million by capitalizing on their global fan base and massive demand for live broadcasts. As a testament to their popularity, Manchester United matches were chosen for live coverage a record 25 times during the season, reflecting the club's impressive ability to draw viewership. Balancing Coverage: Liverpool and Arsenal's Shared Screen Time Liverpool and Arsenal, two other prominent clubs in England, have enjoyed relatively equal exposure in terms of live broadcasts. Both teams were selected to appear on television 22 times each during the season. It is important to note that this level of coverage is still quite impressive and helps generate substantial financial gains for the clubs. Consistent appearances on screen also contribute to increased commercial deals and sponsorships, boosting the clubs' overall earnings. Chelsea: A Step Behind While Chelsea has consistently been one of the top-tier teams in the Premier League, they lagged behind the aforementioned clubs in terms of broadcasting exposure, with just 16 live matches during the season. Despite their on-field success, Chelsea's reduced media presence could hamper long-term growth in terms of international fan-base and sponsorship. The QPR Conundrum In stark contrast to the heavyweights of English football, Queens Park Rangers (QPR) secured a comparatively paltry broadcasting revenue of almost £40 million, despite being featured in only 11 live matches. This disparity illustrates the vast difference in terms of viewership and fan appeal between the elite clubs and those lower down the football echelon. The financial discrepancy also raises questions about the fair distribution of broadcasting revenue within English football. Outlook: BT Sport Enters the Fray The future of English football broadcasting holds tremendous potential, with the entrance of BT Sport set to disrupt the existing broadcasting landscape. This new player promises to inject a significant amount of money and resources into the industry, driving up broadcaster competition for live football rights. As a consequence, the earnings from television coverage for all clubs, especially the top-tier sides, are expected to skyrocket. Conclusion The broadcasting revenue generated by English football clubs is a critical aspect of their financial health, with clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal leading the pack. However, as the landscape evolves with new entrants such as BT Sport, the question of creating a more equitable distribution of wealth between the elite and less privileged clubs remains. The future of English football may be shaped by the ability to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and ensuring the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the sport, both on and off the pitch."},{"question":"In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\". - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred. - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance. - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 . - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles. - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom. - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris. - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

Photograph: Petr Josek/Reuters When vinyl record sales hit bottom in the late 1980s, managers at Czech record producer GZ Media in a small town near Prague were wondering what to do with their idle record pressing machines. They decided not to get rid of them and put them in garages at the company's backyard. That proved to be a wise decision. As vinyl retro-mania started spreading around the world a decade later the firm dusted off the presses, and it is now spinning profits on records for the likes of the Rolling Stones, U2, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. With 7m records made in 2012 and 10m expected to be produced this year, GZ Media says it is the world's biggest vinyl record producer, making records for Universal Music Group and Sony Music, and is beginning to co-operate with Warner Music. \\"Vinyl is an inscrutable animal,\\" Jiri Hasek, the company's commercial director told Reuters. \\"Everybody is waiting for when the growth will slow, but instead it keeps accelerating.\\" Vinyl record production accounts for about 30% of GZ Media's sales, which reached 1.8bn crowns (93m) last year. The company also makes sophisticated packaging for expensive consumer goods such as mobile phones, electronics and whisky. Founded in 1948 as Gramofonove Zavody Lodenice, the central record producer in the then-communist bloc, GZ Media pressed its first record in 1951. During the 1980s demand for vinyl records began to ebb as CDs and DVDs emerged. Production bottomed out in the early 1990s when GZ Media was producing only about 200,000 records a year. In 1989 the communist regime collapsed and GZ Media was up for grabs as part of a nationwide privatisation programme. It ended up in the hands of US fund Winslow Partners, which later sold it to the firm's own management. Last Christmas it made a special Beatles recording gift box approved by Paul McCartney and is now working on a special gift packaging of The Who discography. According to the Official Charts Company, vinyl record sales in the UK, one of GZ Media's main markets, have reached 375,000 so far in 2013, which compares with 393,000 for the whole of 2012 and 227,000 in 2009. \\"For uber-fans of a particular band, getting the vinyl edition is a really important souvenir and mark of their commitment to the artist,\\" said Steve Redmond, a spokesman for the Entertainment Retailers Association in the UK. He said vinyl was \\"an inevitable reaction\\" to the rise of digital music, which offers little room for cover art and the kind of tangibility that people were used to. \\"It's never going to return to where it was, when it was the lead format for the industry,\\" Redmond said. \\"But I think it is a far bigger niche than people anticipated that it was going to be and, at the moment, is continuing to grow at a fairly dramatic pace.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"The Czech record producer GZ Media has seen significant success in recent years due to the vinyl record revival, as it has kept its record pressing machines from the 1980s and now produces vinyl records for major artists and labels such as the Rolling Stones, U2, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music. With 7 million records produced in 2012 and 10 million expected for this year, GZ Media claims to be the world's largest vinyl record producer, attributing 30% of its sales to vinyl production, which amounted to 93 million in 2012."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia.

Sentence 2: Only one percent of natural diamonds are of this kind , and most are blue to grey . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","response":"The two sentences seem to convey similar information, but there are subtle differences in their meaning and emphasis. 1. Sentence 1: Only one percent of blue diamonds are of this type and most are natural to gray. In this sentence, the primary focus is on blue diamonds. It suggests that there is a specific type of blue diamond being discussed, and only one percent of all blue diamonds belong to this particular type. Furthermore, the sentence goes on to say that most of these rare blue diamonds, which belong to the discussed type, have a color that ranges from natural to gray. The term \\"natural\\" in this context could either represent a lighter, less intense shade of blue or the original, unaltered color of the diamonds. The usage of the term \\"natural\\" is a bit ambiguous and may require some clarification. 2. Sentence 2: Only one percent of natural diamonds are of this kind, and most are blue to grey. In this sentence, the primary focus is on natural diamonds as a whole. The sentence indicates that there is a specific kind of natural diamond being discussed, and only one percent of all natural diamonds belong to this particular kind. Moreover, the sentence states that most diamonds within this unique category have a color that ranges from blue to grey. The primary difference between the two sentences is their emphasis on what types of diamonds are involved—blue diamonds or natural diamonds. Sentence 1 concentrates on blue diamonds, while Sentence 2 highlights natural diamonds. Additionally, there is a slight difference in the color range discussed. Sentence 1 suggests that the color range is \\"natural to gray,\\" while Sentence 2 describes it as \\"blue to grey.\\" The term \\"natural\\" in the first sentence adds a level of ambiguity not present in the second sentence. In conclusion, these two sentences convey related information but differ in emphasis and the specific color descriptions. They could be referring to the same type of diamonds, but the first sentence focuses on blue diamonds, while the second sentence addresses natural diamonds as a whole."},{"question":"Bonny: Hi, Clyde.

Hanke, a 10-year Google employee who led initial development of Maps, was once the founder of a small geodata startup called Keyhole that Google acquired in 2004. The fact that the one-time entrepreneur has stayed with the search giant for more than a decade makes him and his colleagues oddities in Silicon Valley. “There are quite a large number of [us] who are still at Google, and I have to say I don’t think anyone expected that when we first came in,” he says. Google has used acquisitions to expand its workforce and launch new products since before it was a household name. Recently that strategy has become the modus operandi for technology firms in Silicon Valley. Facebook is using its fast-growing cash hoard to take control over sectors both adjacent to its core product (WhatsApp for 22 billion) and far-flung from social networking (Oculus VR for 2 billion). Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon are doing the same, making big-ticket bets by buying Minecraft developer Mojang (2.5 billion), Tumblr (1.1 billion) and video game streaming site Twitch (970 million), respectively. Even Apple, which long eschewed splashy acquisitions in favor of much smaller, less public buys, says it bought at least 30 companies during the last fiscal year, including the 3 billion purchase of Beats. Overall spending on tech acquisitions topped 170 billion in 2014, up 54% from the previous year and more than double the amount spent in 2010, according to PrivCo, a research firm that tracks investments in private businesses. As the core of dominant technology companies get larger, they have come to depend on acquisitions not only to broaden their businesses but also to sustain the pace of innovation. “Companies are buying innovation,” explains Peter Levine, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “As large companies need to be competitive and want to increase their footprints in a variety of different areas, one of the best ways to do that is through acquisition.” The deals are a boon for startups as well. Venture capital is abundant, and companies can rely on investment rather than revenue to keep growing. If it’s not clear how a startup will eventually convert users into revenue, a buyout from a large firm can render that problem irrelevant—or at least less urgent. While investors and founders insist that launching a thriving self-supporting company is still the end-goal in Silicon Valley, “exiting” via a sale rather than an initial public offering can still net a lucrative payout. “It’s almost a goal for some of these companies as they start, to have that exit event,” says George Geis, a business professor at UCLA whose upcoming book, Semi-Organic Growth, analyzes Google’s acquisition strategy over the years. But while snapping up a startup is now easy, holding onto its key employees is more difficult. Startup founders, who often think of themselves as entrepreneurs before engineers, are notoriously difficult to keep at large firms long. Partly, this is cultural: striking out on one’s own, idea in hand, is a fundamental part of the Silicon Valley ethos. The widespread availability of funding doesn’t hurt, either. That has left firms struggling to keep the expertise they may have spent millions acquiring. “When a firm is making a tech acquisition, they’re buying the talent as much as they’re buying the technology,” says Brian JM Quinn, a law professor specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Boston College. A TIME analysis of startup founders’ LinkedIn profiles found that about two-thirds of the startup founders that accepted jobs at Google between 2006 and 2014 are still with the company. Amazon has retained about 55% of its founders over that time period, while Microsoft’s rate is below 45%. Facebook, with a 75% retention rate for founders, is beating its older competitors, but the company only began acquiring companies in significant numbers around 2010 or so. Yahoo and Apple, which have both gone on acquisition sprees under new CEOs Marissa Mayer and Tim Cook in the last two years, now have a similar retention rate to Google. Google stands out among this cohort in large part because of the massive number of acquisitions it’s conducted. Overall at least 221 startup founders joined Google’s ranks between 2006 and 2014. Yahoo, the next closest competitor, added at least 110 founders to its employee roster in that time. Google’s internal calculation of its overall retention rate for startup founders through its history is similar to TIME’s, according to data provided by the company. Apple, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft declined to share any information on the retention of founders; Amazon did not respond to a request for data. An examination of the ways Google tries to retain employees provides a window into the increasingly ferocious battle among the tech sector’s giants to expand through conquest. “Google,” says Geis, “has done a pretty good job—among the best in Silicon Valley.” Even when Google was small, it wasn’t shy about spending. The company’s first startup acquisition, the 2003 purchase of Pyra Labs, forms the backbone of what is today Blogger, an online publishing platform. Since then, many of Google’s most well-known products, including Android, YouTube, Maps, Docs and Analytics, have originated from acquisitions. “M&A has obviously been a huge part of Google—and, I think, Google’s success—for a long time,” says Don Harrison, Google’s vice president for corporate development, who oversees the company’s acquisitions. Before any deal is finalized, it has to pass what CEO Larry Page calls “the toothbrush test”: is the product something you use daily and would make your life better? “If anything matches the toothbrush test and relates to technology, then Larry has an interest in it,” explains Harrison. Typically, Google buys occur in sectors where the company has already been experimenting itself. Harrison points to YouTube as a prime example. Google already had a video sharing service called Google Video in the mid-2000’s, but YouTube’s fast-growing user base convinced the firm to offer a then-eye-popping 1.65 billion for the startup, even though it was barely a year old and earned no revenue. Today, YouTube brings in billions of dollars of revenue per year and is the third most-visited website in the world, according to Web analytics firm Alexa. But the return on investment on an acquisition isn’t only measured monetarily. It’s important to Google and other tech giants that the founders behind ideas worth paying for stick around as well. Harrison says founder retention is one of the significant factors Google measures as part of the “scorecarding” it does to evaluate its purchases. “We hold ourselves accountable to make sure that the founders are able to be successful within Google,” Harrison says. “It’s something that we’re not only working on at the time we buy the company but we work on for years after as well.” Cash alone can’t convince the top startup founders to join Google. 2014 was the most active year for IPOs in the U.S. since the year 2000, according to IPO tracker Renaissance Capital, and Chinese online retailer Alibaba had the biggest public debut in world history, raising 25 billion in September. “As aggressive as we’re willing to be, we probably can’t match public company premiums right now,” Harrison admits. So Google tries to find other ways to lure key talent. For Tony Fadell, the CEO of smart home company Nest, the decision of whether or not be acquired by Google was really a question of how he wanted to spend his time. Google had begun courting Nest almost from the company’s inception, ever since Fadell showed Google founder Sergey Brin a prototype of the Nest Thermostat at a TED conference in 2011. At the time, Fadell wasn’t interested in a buyout. “I wanted to keep it as a startup as long as possible,” he says. But as Nest grew, so did Fadell’s logistical headaches. By 2013, he says he was spending 90% of his time on what he calls “back-of-house stuff”: managing finances, talking to investors, wrestling with taxes and fending off patent lawsuits. “There was a lot of selling to multiple entities that we were doing the right thing,” he says. When Google came knocking again, offering a big payday and the chance to keep Nest’s name brand intact—a key requirement for Fadell—an acquisition seemed more appealing. Now Fadell says he spends 95% of his time focused on product development and key relationships. Nest, meanwhile, has gotten access to resources that would have taken much longer to accrue independently. The company launched in five new countries in 2014, but Fadell thinks they would have only reached two without Google’s help. In many ways, the Nest acquisition is the ideal scenario startup founders envision when they agree to be swallowed by a larger company. Harrison, Google’s M&A head, calls Fadell a “true CEO” and says Google execs serve more as a board of directors for Nest instead of supervisors. Fadell says he hasn’t had to get formal approval for anything from Google, though he reports directly to Larry Page and meets with the Google CEO a few times per month. “He’s like, ‘Call me when you need me, but this is for you to run,’” Fadell says of his relationship with Page. “He gives us the freedom, so I run with that. Only when it’s really major decisions do I really touch base with him.” Some founders who don’t quite have Fadell’s free rein are still granted a certain level of autonomy. Skybox Imaging, a satellite manufacturer that Google acquired for 500 million last summer, reports to the company’s vice president of engineering for geo products but maintains separate offices from Google in Mountain View. “We kind of get a little bit of the best of both worlds,” says Ching-Yu Hu, one of the four Skybox founders that now works at Google. “We’re all Googlers now so we have access to all the infrastructure there, but at the same time we’re semi-autonomous.” The company has experimented with more direct incentives to maintain an entrepreneurial spirit. For a few years in the mid-2000’s Google handed out Founders Awards valued at as much as 12 million in stock to teams that developed successful new products like Gmail and Google Maps. Today awards are a little less explicit, in the form of more traditional of raises or promotions. Google works closely with founders in their first 90 days on the job to insure they’re getting acclimated well, but check-ins on founders’ progress can continue for years, depending on the acquisition. At the core of Google’s pitch to founders is the opportunity for bountiful resources. Sure, those can be scratched and clawed for independently, but going it alone requires a lot more time, money and luck than hitching your wagon to one of the richest companies on Earth. “It was a pretty compelling pitch,” Hanke recalls of his own deliberations about whether to sell Keyhole to Google. “We could achieve a lot more standing on the shoulders of all that was going on at Google versus trying to do it on our own as startup.” Still, even Harrison admits that not every acquisition goes smoothly. Because California is an at-will employment state, workers can generally be fired or choose to leave at any time. Tech companies try to ensure founders stick around for a while by offering a stay bonus or using “golden handcuffs,” which often meter out the payday for a big acquisition in company shares that vest over several years. Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, for instance, includes 3 billion in restricted stock for WhatsApp employees, but they can’t fully tap into those funds unless they stay at the company for four years. In some cases, golden handcuffs aren’t enough to keep founders on board. Kosta Eleftheriou joined Google in October 2010 through the acquisition of his keyboard app BlindType, but life at the massive company wasn’t what he envisioned. Eleftheriou says he was relegated to maintaining Google’s stock Android keyboard rather than envisioning ways to improve the product. He left after one month, leaving half of his compensation package for the acquisition on the table (he says the total acquisition price was in the seven figures). Now he’s a founder again, with a new keyboard app called Fleksy that has been downloaded 4 million times. “It was a mismatch between what I was expecting and what happened,” Eleftheriou says. “I think that was partly due to maybe some unrealistic expectations on my side on how much creative freedom I would have. I was hoping to be part of a bigger picture than just some engineer working on something by themselves.” As the founder of a small company that didn’t make huge headlines when it was acquired, Eleftheriou’s experience isn’t uncommon in the Valley. “Unless they’re sufficiently large, very few acquisitions continue to run independently,” says Justin Kan, a partner at the venture capital firm Y Combinator and cofounder of Twitch. “Oftentimes founders are rolled up inside another group inside of the company. They can’t make decisions as freely as when they were entrepreneurs. That affects people’s willingness to stick around.” Sometimes founders simply crave the excitement of starting something new. Uri Levine was the only one of Waze’s three founders who chose not to join Google when the traffic app was acquired for 1 billion in June 2013. Instead he launched a new startup—his sixth—called FeeX, which aims to help people reduce investment fees in their retirement accounts. “Entrepreneurs, they are driven by a passion for change,” Levine says. “As soon as you become part of a large organization, you cannot change anymore.” Google’s also had some more high-profile misfires. When it made its largest acquisition ever, the 12.5 billion purchase of handset maker Motorola Mobility, Page hailed it as an opportunity to “supercharge the Android ecosystem.” But Motorola’s phones failed to gain traction, the subsidiary racked up 1.4 billion in losses for Google, and the company offloaded the handset division to Lenovo for 2.9 billion in 2014. Harrison defends the deal as a smart acquisition because of the patent portfolio that Google acquired, helping the company defend itself from lawsuits by Apple and Microsoft (Geis, who has studied the transaction closely, called it “a wash” for Google). At Google, at least, there are opportunities for change for some founders who join the company. Hanke, the former Keyhole CEO, spent several years heading up Google’s geo services, but now he’s in charge of Niantic Labs, a separately branded unit that Google bills as an “internal startup.” Hanke’s team develops apps that increase the opportunity for digital interaction in real-world environments, like InGress, a mobile game that requires players to visit physical locations to gain power ups. Android founder Andy Rubin also took on a role far removed from smartphones when he became the head of Google’s robotics division in 2013. (Rubin eventually left Google in October after nine years at the company). Google is constantly making these kinds of bets on the future, and it needs new blood with fresh ideas to sustain them. The company is currently wrestling with multiple threats to its core business, search, including a declining share of desktop searches and a mobile market where Amazon is stealing product search queries and Facebook is taking ad dollars. If Google is to maintain its steady growth, it will eventually have to tap into a new revenue source somewhere, and that may well stem from an acquisition. The company may view Nest as the key purchase that ensures its future dominance, given Fadell’s perch. “Founders and everyone else at these startups, they want to be businesspeople,” he explains. And the big businesses themselves? They want to ensure they don’t miss out on the next big thing. “The ability to move quickly in rapidly changing markets is one of the major drivers,” says Geis of the acquisition spree. “If you want to effectively compete and innovate continually, it can’t all be from within.” Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described George Geis. He is a business professor at UCLA. What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"Google buys smaller companies and keeps their talented employees to help it grow and make new products. They have bought many companies, like Keyhole, which helped make Google Maps. Some people who create these smaller companies stay with Google for a long time and enjoy working on their products with Google's support and resources. Google has managed to keep around two-thirds of these creative people from 2006 to 2014, which is a good thing for the company. Sometimes, even big amounts of money can't keep these talented people at Google because they want to start something new or be more independent. Overall, Google's strategy of buying smaller companies has helped them be successful and continue to create new and useful products."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: A compartmentalized tray of food is seen in this image.","response":"In the given sentence, the most salient words, or the words that carry the primary meaning and relevance, are: 1.

There is no single \\"most common\\" voltage range that applies to all railway systems, but there are some voltages that are more common in certain regions or for specific types of trains. Electrified railway systems typically use one of several standard voltage levels: 1. Direct Current (DC) - 600-750 V DC: This range is often used for urban tramways and light rail systems. - 1,500 V DC: This voltage is commonly used in several countries, such as France and Japan. - 3,000 V DC: This is a popular voltage range for mainline railways in several European countries, such as Italy and Spain. 2. Alternating Current (AC) - 15 kV, 16.7 Hz AC: This range is widely used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and other neighboring countries, especially for regional and long-distance trains. - 25 kV, 50 Hz AC: This is the most common voltage range used for long-distance electrified railways worldwide, and is most common in Europe, Russia, China, and India. These voltage ranges are determined by factors such as efficiency, power requirements for different types of trains, and safety considerations. It is also worth mentioning that some countries have multiple voltage ranges in operation due to historical reasons, technology advancements, or differences between regional and national railway networks. For example, in the United Kingdom, both 750 V DC and 25 kV, 50 Hz AC are used on different parts of the rail network. In summary, there is no specific \\"most common\\" voltage range for railway systems globally, as it varies depending on the region, type of trains, locale (urban vs. long-distance), and other factors. However, some ranges like 25 kV, 50 Hz AC for AC systems, and 1,500 V DC or 3,000 V DC for DC systems are more widespread than others."},{"question":"Background: Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Context: Harrison was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, in 1945 to an engineering family. His father died when he was a teenager and he found himself \\"bored, alienated, resentful and entrapped\\", playing truant from Dunsmore School (now Ashlawn School). An English teacher introduced him to George Bernard Shaw which resulted in an interest in polemic. He ended school during 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the Atherstone Hunt), a student teacher (1963-65), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included electric guitars and writing pastiches of H. H. Munro. His first short story was published during 1966 by Kyril Bonfiglioli at Science Fantasy magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met Michael Moorcock, who was editing New Worlds magazine. He began writing reviews and short fiction for New Worlds, and by 1968 he was appointed books editor. Harrison was critical of what he perceived as the complacency of much genre fiction of the time. During 1970, Harrison scripted comic stories illustrated by R.G. Jones for such forums as Cyclops and Finger. An illustration by Jones appears in the first edition of Harrison's The Committed Men (1971). In an interview with Zone magazine, Harrison says \\"I liked anything bizarre, from being about four years old. I started on Dan Dare and worked up to the Absurdists. At 15 you could catch me with a pile of books that contained an Alfred Bester, a Samuel Beckett, a Charles Williams, the two or three available J. G. Ballards, On the Road by Jack Kerouac, some Keats, some Allen Ginsberg, maybe a Thorne Smith. I've always been pick 'n' mix: now it's a philosophy.\\" Question: Who was his mother?.

Question: suppose the coffee filter could be saturated with water happens, how will it affect more water making it through the coffee filter. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"When a coffee filter becomes saturated with water, it means that the pores of the filter are filled with water, making it difficult for additional water to pass through the filter. This will impact the brewing process as the water will struggle to flow through the coffee grounds, which is crucial for extracting the coffee's flavors and essential oils. The saturated filter can cause a few possible outcomes, which I will discuss below. Firstly, the brewing process may take longer than usual, as the water will have a harder time passing through the saturated filter. This also means that less water will be able to make it through the coffee filter at any given time. Consequently, the flow rate of water through the coffee grounds will decrease, which can result in a longer extraction time. The brewed coffee may taste over-extracted or bitter due to the prolonged contact between the water and coffee grounds. Secondly, if the coffee filter is overly saturated with water, there is a possibility that some water will spill over the filter, rather than pass through the coffee grounds. In this case, the water that does not pass through the coffee grounds will have no contact with the coffee, resulting in a diluted and weak-tasting brew. If water is unable to pass through the coffee grounds, it will not have any interaction with the coffee and will not become coffee. The supposed perturbation of the saturated coffee filter in this case will influence the second effect mentioned in the process (the transformation of water into coffee). Since the saturated filter makes it harder for water to pass through the coffee grounds, there will be less water passing through the grounds, potentially leading to a decreased overall coffee volume. Furthermore, as the water resource struggles to extract the essential oils, flavors, and aromas from the coffee grounds, the quality of the brewed coffee may suffer. This means the saturated filter may negatively impact the brewed coffee, causing it to taste over-extracted, bitter, or diluted, depending on how the excess water interacts with the brewing process. In summary, the saturation of the coffee filter has a negative effect on the brewing process. It will lead to less water passing through the coffee filter effectively, thus impairing the quality and flavor of the brewed coffee."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you're given a short story of five sentences written in natural language.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B? Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. A:","response":"In case A, the objects would be closer to each other. This is because case A involves charging by conduction, which requires the objects to be in direct contact with each other for electrons to migrate and even out the charge.

Options: - boredom - enjoy - moving - fatigue - injuries Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"There could be several reasons why someone without much to do keeps driving. Let's analyze each option step-by-step. 1. Boredom: If a person has nothing much to do, they might choose to keep driving to pass the time. Driving could be a way to take a break from monotony, and it can provide a sense of fulfillment, as they are at least engaged in an activity. It may also help them see new places or experience the thrill of being on the road. 2. Enjoy: Some people genuinely enjoy the act of driving itself as it relaxes them or gives them pleasure. Driving can be soothing and provides a sense of freedom and control. For these individuals, driving can be a way to unwind and destress, even if they don't have any particular destination in mind. 3. Moving: Continual driving might be the result of a person wanting to keep moving, either to explore new places or as a subconscious effort to outrun their problems or emotions. Driving can be a form of escape or a way to clear one's mind, offering a temporary sense of relief from whatever issues they might be facing in their life. 4. Fatigue: Although counterintuitive, some people might keep driving when they feel fatigued. They might see it as a lesser evil than facing the exhaustion and isolation of their home or work environment. Continuous driving, even when fatigued, could stem from a person's desire for motion, which in turns provides a distraction from their tiredness. 5. Injuries: In some cases, a person might continue driving due to physical injuries. Driving can be less strenuous than walking or other physical activities. Also, if a person has personal mobility equipment in their vehicle, driving might be the most accessible option for them to stay active, despite their injuries. In conclusion, someone without much to do could keep driving due to boredom, enjoyment, a desire for constant motion, fatigue, or even injuries. The specific reason would depend on the individual's unique circumstances, preferences, and mindset."},{"question":"How does the sentence end?

Many creatures lived in the desert. Some learned to survive within her harsh burning grip. Some even learned to thrive in her, building stone monuments to themselves and living their lives surrounded in the lavish luxuries of Gods. How puny their monuments were compared to the desert herself. Where they had castles surrounded by dry moats, the desert had mountains surrounded by thousand year sandstorms. Where they had silks and the most beautiful slaves serving their every greatest desire, she had dunes that stretched for a thousand leagues and a sun that burned huge and deep crimson in the violet sky. Where desert kings, the Danken, dined on the finest food and drank the finest wine, the desert drank every drop of water from the air itself and feasted on men. Kadin knew the desert. He knew her voice whispering in the dark of night like a dangerous lover. The sound he heard now was not her voice but a cry from one trapped within the desert's teeth. It was the cry of a woman. Kadin rose from his makeshift bed in the dip of two dunes. He stood quickly, tying the leather straps of his knife belt around his waist. He pulled on his boots and silently mounted White Ash. THe mare felt his soft touch and made no sound. Kadin listened and heard the cry again. He studied the dunes in the darkness of night. THe blood moon painted the desert a deep red. He felt the echos and turned White Ash towards their origin. He rode quietly into the night. Kadin saw the glow of torchlight long before cresting the hill. He guessed four riders from the sound of their horses and confirmed it when he rose above them. Three men, now on foot, chased a woman in black across the dune. Their horses stood back, panting from a hard ride. The woman's own stallion lay dead, a black arrow buried in its flank. Question: Kadin must make a decision about: Options: - Whether to build a castle in the desert. - Whether or not to sell his horse White Ash. - Whether or not to help the woman. - not enough information === The correct answer is A:","response":"Whether or not to help the woman. Kadin must make a decision about whether or not to help the woman who is being chased by the three men across the dunes. As he observes the scene from a distance, he has several factors to consider while making this decision. For one, he is well-acquainted with the desert and its dangers, and he may worry about the potential harm that could come to the woman if she is left at the mercy of her pursuers. Furthermore, her cry for help has already caught his attention, and his instincts might be urging him to intervene and offer his assistance. On the other hand, Kadin may also have to think about the potential risks that come with getting involved in this situation. He does not know who these men are or why they are pursuing the woman, and there might be unknown consequences if he interferes with their actions. Additionally, Kadin may be concerned about his own safety and that of his horse, White Ash, if the situation escalates into violence. As Kadin weighs his options, he will likely consider the moral obligation he feels to help someone in need, especially in the harsh desert environment where survival can be a challenge for even the most adept desert dwellers. Additionally, his familiarity with the desert could provide him with potential strategic advantages in potentially rescuing the woman, such as knowing the best routes to evade her pursuers or where to find shelter if necessary. Ultimately, Kadin's decision will be influenced by both his personal values and his assessment of the situation. As the story unfolds, it will provide more context and information that Kadin can use to make his decision about whether or not to help the woman being pursued by the three men in the desert."},{"question":"Where will a book being read by one person be kept?

During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

The media are swarming over Westin's alleged relationship - This indicates that the media is paying significant attention to Westin's supposed relationship. 2. Westin's alleged relationship is with ABC's PR chief, Sherrie Rollins - The relationship in question involves a high-ranking figure at ABC, which could potentially link the relationship to professional issues or conflicts of interest. 3. Sherrie Rollins was Westin's direct subordinate - This piece of information suggests there might be a power imbalance in their relationship, which could potentially lead to ethical concerns. 4. Sherrie Rollins is still married to Ed Rollins - Rollins being married adds another layer of complexity to the relationship, as it involves infidelity, which many people consider immoral. Considering these points, we can conclude that the media is likely covering Westin's relationship in a negative light, emphasizing its potentially immoral aspects. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the media is labeling the relationship as immoral. Instead, it points out various factors that could contribute to such a perception. As an AI, I would paraphrase the sentence as: \\"The media is focusing on Westin's relationship with his subordinate and married PR chief, Sherrie Rollins, highlighting its controversial aspects.\\""},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions.

Brougham Castle (pronounced ) is a medieval building about 2 miles (3.2 km) south-east of Penrith, Cumbria, England. The castle was founded by Robert I de Vieuxpont in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, Eamont and Lowther, had been chosen by the Romans for a Roman fort called Brocavum. The castle is scheduled as an Ancient Monument, along with the fort, as \\"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\\".In its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone keep, with an enclosure protected by an earthen bank and a wooden palisade. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only lords in the region who were loyal to King John. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in North West England, who also owned the castles of Appleby and Brough. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by Henry III. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the Clifford family through marriage. With the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence, in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King Edward I of England at the castle. Robert's son, Roger Clifford, was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King Edward II of England, although they were returned once his son Edward III became king. The region was often at risk from the Scots, and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself..., can you guess it ? A:","response":"Based on the provided article, five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time include: 1. New industrial processes: Manchester experienced rapid industrial growth during the Industrial Revolution. Developments in textile manufacturing, particularly in the processing and production of cotton, led to an increase in the number of cotton mills in the city. This resulted in Manchester becoming an important industrial center. 2. New ways of thinking: The city saw the rise of the Manchester School, a group of economists and thinkers who advocated for free trade and laissez-faire policies. This new economic ideology had a significant influence on politics and policymaking both in the city and on the global stage. 3. New social classes and groups: The Industrial Revolution brought about significant social changes in Manchester. The rapid industrial growth attracted workers from various backgrounds, leading to the formation of diverse working-class communities. Additionally, the rise of manufacturing led to the emergence of a new middle class consisting of entrepreneurs, managers, and factory owners. 4. New religious sects: Manchester's cosmopolitan atmosphere and openness to new ideas fostered an environment in which new religious groups and sects could emerge and thrive. This diverse spiritual landscape became an essential aspect of the city's cultural fabric. 5. New forms of labor organization: As the working conditions in the rapidly growing industries became harsher, there was a growing need for better representation of workers' rights. The first Trades Union Congress took place in Manchester in 1868, marking the beginning of a new era in labor organization and giving birth to the modern trade union movement. Manchester also played a crucial role in the development of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement, both advocating for social justice and equal rights. The provided text also emphasizes Manchester's reputation as an innovative and forward-looking city, with the saying \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Overall, Manchester's status as a hub of industry, culture, and new ideas made it not only a symbol of the Industrial Revolution but also a driving force for change during the 19th century."},{"question":"Write a question about the article Then there 's is my baby pitbull .

The first is one mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is one mile from the finish line. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"1. The marathon is 26 miles long, and it is circular. 2. The first checkpoint is 1 mile from the start line, and the last checkpoint is 1 mile from the finish line. 3. Since the start and finish lines are the same point (due to the marathon being circular), we need to account for those 2 miles (1 mile for each checkpoint) in our calculation. 4. Remaining distance to be covered between checkpoints: 26 miles (total) - 1 mile (to first checkpoint) - 1 mile (from last checkpoint to finish) = 24 miles. 5. The checkpoints have equal spacing between them. Let's determine the number of spaces between checkpoints. 6. There is one space between the first and second checkpoints, another between the second and third checkpoints, and a third space between the third and last checkpoints. 7. Therefore, there are a total of 3 spaces between the 4 checkpoints. 8. To get the distance between each consecutive checkpoint, we divide the remaining distance (24 miles) by the number of spaces (3). 9. Calculation: 24 miles ÷ 3 spaces = 8 miles per space. 10.

McCall travels to Istanbul by train to retrieve a local bookstore owner's daughter who was kidnapped by her father. He also helps Sam Rubinstein, an elderly Holocaust survivor who is looking for a painting of his sister; the two siblings were separated when they were transported to different camps by the Nazis, but the painting has been auctioned off and Sam cannot prove that he owns it. After discovering that the apartment courtyard has been vandalised, McCall accepts an offer from Miles Whittaker, a young resident with an artistic but troubled background, to repaint the walls. At some point, McCall rescues Miles, who had been lured away by a gang to commit crimes for them. One day, Susan and DIA operative Dave York, McCall's former teammate, are called to investigate the apparent murder-suicide of an agency affiliate and his wife in Brussels. When the two separate after reaching their hotel, Susan is accosted and killed in an apparent robbery by two men who got off the elevator on her floor. When he receives the news, McCall begins to investigate both her death and the case she was working on.

Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission. As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases. An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half-life, which is the amount of time it takes for one-half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope. Consider the following example. Suppose we have 100.0 g of tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen). It has a half-life of 12.3 y. After 12.3 y, half of the sample will have decayed from hydrogen-3 to helium-3 by emitting a beta particle, so that only 50.0 g of the original tritium remains. After another 12.3 y— making a total of 24.6 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 25.0 g of tritium. After another 12.3 y—now a total of 36.9 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 12.5 g. This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 15.1 \\"Radioactive Decay\\".

Step 2: Isolate the variable term on one side of the equation To isolate the variable term (in this case, -2*m), we need to eliminate the constant term on the same side of the equation. In our case, the constant term is -451. We can do this by adding 451 to both sides of the equation. This way, we maintain the balance of the equation: (-2*m - 451) + 451 = (-445) + 451 Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation Now we will simplify both sides of the equation by performing the addition operation: -2*m + 0 = 6 -2*m = 6 Step 4: Solve for the variable Our next objective is to solve for m, which can be done by isolating the variable m on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -2.

Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island.

To answer the question \\"What is the annual average direct solar irradiation?\\" accurately, we should provide specific figures on the amount of solar energy that the Sahara Desert receives each year. Direct solar irradiation refers to the radiation from the sun that reaches the earth's surface without being scattered or absorbed by the atmosphere. This is the primary factor that determines the potential for solar energy production in a given area. The Sahara Desert has some of the highest levels of solar irradiation in the world, mainly due to its geographical location and climatic conditions. It is situated between latitudes 15°N and 35°N, which places it in the sunbelt region, where the sun's rays are most intense. Moreover, the Sahara has exceptionally clear skies with minimal cloud cover and very low humidity, allowing for more direct sunlight to reach the ground. According to various studies, the annual average direct solar irradiation in the Sahara Desert ranges from 2,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter (m²) to 3,000 kWh/m². Some regions in the Sahara, particularly in the central and eastern parts, can experience even higher levels of irradiation, going up to 3,500 kWh/m² per year. To put these numbers into perspective, the global average for solar irradiation is around 1,700 kWh/m² per year. As a comparison, the average solar irradiation in Germany, a world leader in solar energy production, is about 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m² annually. This demonstrates the immense potential of the Sahara Desert for solar energy production. Harnessing the abundant solar energy in the Sahara could contribute significantly to the global energy supply. Large-scale solar power plants, such as concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) installations, could be installed in the desert to make use of its vast, unoccupied land area and ample sunlight. If properly managed, the electricity generated from these projects could not only support local communities and African countries but also be exported to other continents via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production\\" does hint at the high levels of solar irradiation in the region, but it fails to answer the question \\"What is the annual average direct solar irradiation?\\" specifically. To provide a valid answer, figures such as 2,000 kWh/m² to 3,500 kWh/m² per year should be mentioned, which represent the range of annual average direct solar irradiation in the Sahara Desert."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Oliver & Company Movie plot: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, he meets a laid-back dog named Dodger who assists him in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Afghan Hound, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Bill Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin it must be paid in three days, or else. Sykes' dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver but he is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money. After the dogs cheer him up, he is introduced to Oliver, and, considering that they all need help, accepts him into the gang. The next day, Fagin and his dogs, now including Oliver, hit the streets to sell some shoddy goods and perhaps steal money.

Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking to help dough and batters rise. It is a mixture of a base (usually baking soda) and an acid, which create a chemical reaction producing carbon dioxide gas, creating air bubbles and causing the dough to rise. Option I: Use baking soda and cream of tartar In this method, baking soda, a base, is combined with cream of tartar, an acid, to mimic the properties of baking powder. Proportions typically used are: 1. 2 parts cream of tartar to 1 part baking soda Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda and cream of tartar in a bowl. 2. Mix thoroughly to create the substitute for baking powder. Option II: Use salt, baking soda, and a little sugar In this method, baking soda is combined with salt and sugar. However, this combination lacks an acidic component, and the chemical reaction required to make the dough or batter rise will not occur. Steps for this method: 1. Combine baking soda, salt, and sugar in a bowl. 2. Mix together for the substitution, although this will not work effectively as a baking powder substitute due to the missing acidic component. Based on the properties and purpose of baking powder, Option I (baking soda and cream of tartar) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of substituting baking powder.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

The AIM-4 Falcon used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%. Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 Six-Day War, achieving 60 kills and 10 losses. However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of out of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%).

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Input: Context_1 : From Keflavík, With Love is a retrospective anthology issued in 2001 by Big Beat Records consisting of twenty songs by Thor's Hammer (Hljómar), a 1960s garage rock and beat group from Iceland who were one of the best-known Icelandic groups during the era. Though they worked with different producers on various labels, Thor's Hammer sound is best-typified by the tough, aggressive fuzz-drenched rockers they recorded in London for Parlophone Records in 1966, such as \\"I Don't Care,\\" \\"My Life,\\" \\"Better Days,\\" and \\"The Big Beat Country Dance\\", and \\"If You Knew\\". While the lyrics to most of their songs were sung in English, several tracks were recorded in their native Icelandic, such as \\"Fyrsti Kossinn\\", \\"Ef Hún Er Nálægt Mér\\", and \\"Ertu Med\\", which was covered by the Savages on their \\"Live 'n Wild\\" album. Some of the tracks from Thor's Hammer's final period in the late 1960s, such as \\"Stay\\", show the group stretching their sound stylistically, augmenting certain arrangements with keyboards and horns. At his time, Thor's Hammer moved into a more eclectic direction, but they broke up in 1969, with several of their members going on to join the progressive rock group, Trubrot.

The compilation features twenty four tracks by different various artists who recorded there, and all except four have not been previously compiled. The Midnite Sound recording were often typified by an echo-laden sound, giving them a characteristically \\"outer space\\" vibe. The performers tended to be, even by 1960s garage rock norms, untutored and naively strange and noncommercial racket. The groups and artists who recorded at Midnite Sound tended to be less British Invasion-influenced than most, sometimes displaying rockabilly and pre-Beatles stylistics.

Over the next several years, these uprisings were subdued in a violent manner by the new Islamic government. The new government went about purging itself of the non-Islamist political opposition. Although both nationalists and Marxists had initially joined with Islamists to overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were executed by the Islamic government afterward. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): The new Iranian government purged itself of what political opposition?","response":"The new Iranian government, which was established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, purged itself of several significant political opposition groups. While these opposition groups, including nationalists and Marxists, had initially joined forces with the Islamists to overthrow the Shah, they found themselves facing severe repression under the new Islamic government. The main political opposition groups that faced purges in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution were: 1. Nationalists: These were a broad range of political groups and individuals who sought to promote national sovereignty, self-determination, and independence from foreign influence. Many Iranian nationalists had initially supported the Islamic Revolution due to their shared desire to remove the Shah and end foreign interference in Iran's affairs. However, following the establishment of the new Islamic government, nationalists found themselves increasingly marginalized and suppressed as the new regime sought to consolidate power and impose its Islamist vision on the country. 2. Marxists and left-wing organizations: Left-wing political factions such as the Tudeh Party (Iranian Communist Party), various Marxist-Leninist organizations, and the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) were also instrumental in the struggle against the Shah. These groups argued for a more egalitarian, secular, and socialist society in contrast to the religious and traditionalist ideals promoted by the Islamists. The Islamic government, however, perceived these secular and leftist movements as threats to its power, leading to widespread purges, imprisonment, and execution of their members. The Marxist and leftist organizations faced persecution and repression, which significantly diminished their influence in post-revolution Iran. In conclusion, the new Iranian government purged itself of nationalists and left-wing political opposition, including Marxists, following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. This move reflected the regime's determination to consolidate power and maintain its control over the country by eliminating dissent and silencing those with alternative visions for Iran's future."},{"question":"Write a negative yelp review.","response":"Step 1: Identify the name of the business and its location In order to write a negative Yelp review, I first need to have the name of the business and its location, so that the review can be attributed to the correct business. For this example, I will choose \\"Joe's Diner\\" located in \\"123 Main St., Springfield\\". Step 2: Recall personal experience with the business In order to write a genuine and honest review, it is crucial to recall a personal experience with the business. Since I am an AI, I do not have personal experiences, but I will fabricate a scenario that aligns with writing a negative review. In this scenario, my visit to \\"Joe's Diner\\" was marred by poor customer service, long waiting time, and unsatisfactory food quality. Step 3: Structure the review with an appropriate rating, clear description, and detailed feedback The review must include a star rating out of 5, where 1 star represents a very negative experience. The description needs to be clear and concise about the issues experienced during the visit, and provide detailed feedback that can help the business improve. Step 4: Write the review Title: \\"A Disappointing Dining Experience\\" Rating: 1 out of 5 stars My visit to Joe's Diner at 123 Main St., Springfield, felt like a night wasted. From the moment I entered, everything seemed to go wrong. Entering the diner, the hostess was busy talking on the phone, leaving us standing awkwardly. After a solid 10 minutes, the hostess finally seated us. A painfully long wait for service was the first indication of what was to come. Our server took at least 20 minutes just to take our orders, without offering a reason or apology for the delay. It only got worse when the food arrived - my burger was cold, and the fries tasted as if they had been sitting out for hours. My friend's salad was wilted and the dressing was bland. When we brought these issues up with the server, we were met with a dismissive attitude and no real attempt at a resolution. Unwilling to continue dining there, we decided not to risk ordering dessert and cut our losses. Overall, I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience at Joe's Diner. The poor customer service, lack of attentiveness, and subpar food quality have earned this place a one-star review.

A voice said, \\"This is Yeah, riiiight, he thought. But he quickly realized the call was no prank. While visiting Steven Spielberg's office, Jackson had admired one of Nordahl's paintings of Army troops invading an Apache camp as a young corporal shielded two Indian children. Now the singer was reaching out to the painter. For art lessons. \\"He asked if I taught drawing and painting,\\" says Nordahl, whose realist oils of 19th-century Apaches are highly prized. \\"I told him I didn't, but that I'd think about it. I was really busy.\\" Their hour-long conversation sparked a close friendship and working partnership that led Nordahl to abandon renown in the art world for a cloistered vocation as Jackson's portraitist. From 1988 to 2005, Nordahl completed thousands of drawings and roughly a dozen epic commissions, seven of which were among 2,000 Jackson items in Julien's authorized auction, which the singer sued to stop last spring. Many canvases encapsulate Jackson's grandiose fantasies and fairy-tale worldview. In a massive triptych, he is crowned and knighted in royal robes. Along the sunlit path in Field of Dreams, he leads children of all nationalities (plus sister Janet, AIDS activist Ryan White and actor Macaulay Culkin). His firstborn son snoozes on an oversized golden throne in Prince, The Boy King. Nordahl, 68, became not only Jackson's favorite living artist (Michelangelo led the historic ranking) but a trusted adviser and confidant who designed Neverland carnival rides and joined family outings. He ducked the media for years, \\"because they wanted to talk about negative stuff, and I don't know anything bad about Michael,\\" the soft-spoken Nordahl says, sitting with artist/wife Lori Peterson and frisky cat Scooter in a living room crowded with paintings by the couple. He's speaking now in hopes of brightening a picture darkened since Jackson's death June 25. \\"I always thought of him as normal,\\" he says. \\"He's the most thoughtful, respectful person I've ever met. In 20 years, I never heard him raise his voice.\\" Nordahl's Jackson period began after the singer invited him to the Denver stop of the Bad tour in March 1988. \\"I didn't know what to expect,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He was sweet. We went to galleries, bookstores and a private showing of the King Tut exhibit. We sat around and laughed and talked and drew.\\" Jackson demonstrated talent but was stretched too thin to pursue visual arts. Instead, the two began hatching ideas for Nordahl to paint. The artist conceived the inaugural work, Playmates for a Lonely Child, a 41-inch-square oil of Jackson in a sylvan storybook scene. Next Nordahl embarked on a far bolder statement, Field of Dreams, a 36-by-104-inch oil study for an unfinished work that would have measured 12 by 38 feet. He labored non-stop: large portraits, mythical tableaux, 10-foot charcoal drawings, a plaque on the Neverland gate. Nordahl billed Jackson in line with his earlier gallery rates, up to 150,000 for large pieces, and says he was always paid. His duties expanded to amusement park design after Jackson began developing the ranch north of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Nordahl juggled several projects while adapting to Jackson's enchanted lifestyle. At Neverland, the two tested rides and tended the exotic menagerie. They took trips to Disneyland and spent time at billionaire Ron Burkle's La Jolla, Calif., estate, where Jackson's insomnia often meant Nordahl was enlisted for wee-hour practical jokes and beachside chats. (He also was a victim of Jackson's notorious tricks, once finding his briefcase stuffed with bubblegum.) He discovered the unglamorous Jackson, who in the late '80s often drove by himself in a Chevy Blazer (and relieved himself in a bucket because he couldn't risk being mobbed at gas stations) and lived in a two-bedroom Los Angeles condo. \\"I expected a penthouse with maids,\\" Nordahl says. \\"There was a grand piano pushed into the kitchen, a popcorn machine and a good sound system. The other furniture, you couldn't have gotten 50 bucks for it at a garage sale. Before the kids, Michael lived real simply.\\" \\"I grew up in a difficult home, and he did too,\\" says Nordahl, whom Jackson thanks in liner notes for 1991's Dangerous and 1995's HIStory. \\"We had no playtime growing up. We're both fanatical about work. Born in Albert Lea, Minn., Nordahl left home at 12 and supported himself through high school by working on farms, pinstriping cars and selling his art. \\"I can't remember not drawing,\\" he says. \\"I had an abusive, alcoholic father, and drawing is something that takes you out of the real world. I was always interested in cowboys and Indians. I sold drawings of the Lone Ranger to my classmates.\\" He began specializing in Apaches after moving to Steamboat Springs, Colo., in 1977, and his detailed, meticulously researched depictions soon lured collectors. \\"His work had a lot of integrity, and he was one of those rare artists who was humble but extremely talented,\\" says prominent Santa Fe art dealer Ray Dewey, who held lotteries to determine buyers of Nordahl's work because of high demand. \\"His technique took a long time, so he was not prolific. When he talked to me about leaving to paint for Michael Jackson, I had over 200 people on a waiting list for his work. It was an interesting decision on his part. \\"I think what Jackson saw in David was a complete artist,\\" Dewey says. \\"He was a perfectionist. He choreographed everything. Jackson also may have seen his commitment to family. David primarily painted the Apache people's culture and lifeways, but he painted a lot of children, not just warriors. And he painted animals beautifully, especially horses.\\" What Nordahl saw in Jackson was a wounded and misunderstood genius who felt spiritually obligated to help children. Though Jackson was acquitted in his 2005 child sexual abuse trial, it \\"broke his spirit,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Michael would never molest a child. He always felt so bad for kids who were mistreated or sick. He spent so much time with critically ill kids. If a mother called about a dying child somewhere, he'd jump on a plane. \\"People talked about Neverland being his private amusement park. It was always meant for kids. The last time I was at the ranch, they put up a big Sony JumboTron across from a condo building for sick children, so if kids woke up at night, cartoons would be on.\\" 'Michael was a real dad' Nordahl was bewildered that Jackson seemed to elicit more mockery than sympathy. \\"People accused him of trying to be white, which is ridiculous,\\" he says. \\"When I first met him, his vitiligo (a skin disorder that causes pigmentation loss) had gone to the right side of his face and down his neck. Most of his right hand was white. Stark white patches. He used makeup because he had to. Without it, he was speckled all over.\\" Nordahl never witnessed drug use by Jackson but was keenly aware of pain problems that lingered after the star's hair caught fire on a Pepsi ad soundstage. \\"When they were trying to repair that burned spot, he had a balloon under his scalp that was inflated,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He let me feel it. It was a huge mound. As the skin got stretched, they cut it out and stitched the scalp. He was in excruciating pain.\\" Jackson seemed an unlikely addict, Nordahl says, noting his avoidance of cigarettes, alcohol, soft drinks and sugar. \\"He was mostly a vegetarian,\\" he says. \\"When he was on tour, the cooks would make him eat fish and sometimes chicken. He loved little chicken wings. He always drank water. I shared wine with him only twice, once with (ex-wife) Lisa Marie (Presley) and once at Ron Burkle's house. Michael had one glass.\\" The clearest evidence of Jackson's responsible nature emerged in his parenting of Prince, Paris and Blanket. \\"Michael was a real dad, not a Hollywood dad,\\" he says. \\"He'd get up at night to feed them bottles. He'd change them, bathe them, everything a mother does. \\"All the time I spent with those kids, I never heard them beg for anything or throw a fit. I never heard them cry. They were so well-adjusted.\\" Jackson took pains not to spoil his children, says Nordahl, recalling a modest eighth birthday party in L.A. for Prince. (Jackson's mother, Katherine, and sister Rebbie came over but skipped the festivities because of their Jehovah's Witness beliefs, he says.) \\"I was curious to see what Prince was going to get,\\" Nordahl says. \\"I figured it would be pretty extravagant, but he didn't get one thing that cost over 2. He got Play-Doh, little action figures, things we'd call stocking stuffers. \\"The kids were not allowed to watch TV or DVDs or play video games\\" except through points earned by their schoolwork. \\"Nothing was given to them. Michael said, 'I want them to grow up as close to normal as possible.' Those kids were so respectful and courteous, just sweet.\\" Surprise visit to Santa Fe Nordahl grew close to all three. Typically, the artist spent time with the Jackson brood on the West Coast. But over Memorial Day weekend in 2004, the star and his tykes surprised Nordahl by visiting Santa Fe via Jackson's plush private bus (with a 60-inch plasma TV). Jackson suggested a movie outing. \\"I thought we were going to a screening room,\\" Nordahl says. \\"His driver pulled into DeVargas Mall. He was friends with (Roland Emmerich), the director of The Day After Tomorrow, and it was opening weekend. The mall was jammed, and there was no place to park. I took the kids, got the tickets and popcorn, and we went in. Michael came in after the lights went down. \\"The lights came up, and nobody noticed him. He had on a baseball cap and these Chinese silk pajamas. The kids had no masks on. Any of those rags would have paid 100,000 for that picture.\\" He last saw Jackson in 2005, when the singer moved to Bahrain and vowed never again to live on U.S. soil. Accustomed to lulls when Jackson was overseas or overextended, Nordahl resumed painting Apaches and presumed he'd be summoned once Jackson found a new home and showcase for his treasures. The fate of Nordahl's Jackson paintings is in limbo, though they may be part of a touring exhibition of the singer's memorabilia proposed by the estate administrators. \\"I would like to see them in a Michael Jackson museum,\\" Nordahl says. \\"That was always Michael's goal. He was very self-effacing, but he understood he was a music icon.\\" Nordahl, represented by Settlers West Galleries in Tucson and Sherwoods Spirit of America in Santa Fe, has returned to painting Apaches and other subjects. Whether his extended hiatus from the public eye damaged his authority or reputation \\"is difficult to gauge,\\" Dewey says. \\"I don't know if it furthered his career. An artist who does commissions for one patron often is just isolated unless the patron publishes or exhibits the work. David's always been independent, and he's never sought publicity.\\" And how many patrons are the King of Pop? \\"We got to be such good friends that I forgot who I was hanging out with,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Then he'd break into these dance moves, quick as lightning, and it would dawn on me: He's the best entertainer in the world.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Given the context: Why did Alex do this? Answer:","response":"To answer this question, we'll analyze the context and understand the possible reasons for Alex's actions. 1. Identify the key elements in the context: Alex called the doctor for an appointment the next day. 2. Consider possible reasons for calling a doctor: Generally, people call a doctor when they're experiencing health issues or require medical advice or assistance. 3. Examine the timeline: Alex wants an appointment for the next day, which suggests the situation might be somewhat urgent or important, but not an emergency. 4. Evaluate potential motivations for Alex's actions: In this context, Alex could be sick, experiencing discomfort, or need to discuss ongoing treatment or a specific concern with the doctor. Based on this analysis, Alex likely called the doctor to make an appointment for the next day because he is experiencing a health concern or needs to discuss a medical issue that requires prompt attention but isn't an immediate emergency."},{"question":"Solve this math problem Solve 103*y + 1694 = 224*y for y.","response":"To solve the equation 103*y + 1694 = 224*y for y, follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the equation We have the equation 103y + 1694 = 224y. Step 2: Isolate the variable (y) First, we want to have all the terms containing the variable y on one side of the equation, preferably on the left side. To do this, we will subtract 103y from both sides of the equation: 103y + 1694 - 103y = 224y - 103y This simplifies to: 1694 = 121y Now we have isolated y on the right side of the equation. Step 3: Solve for y To solve for y, we will need to divide both sides of the equation by 121, the coefficient of y: 1694 ÷ 121 = 121y ÷ 121 When we perform the division, we get: 14 = y So, y = 14 The solution to the equation 103y + 1694 = 224y is y = 14."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Monaco is a very poor country Monaco is a city and independent state located in the south of France, along the Mediterranean coast.

What to do about it: I've come to realize that when people start conflicts, it is actually an expression of their inner state expressed in an outside way.

But the most important question was, \\"What was the first score of the game?\\" In every game, there's a magic moment when the first points are scored. It could be a basket in basketball, a goal in soccer, or a touchdown in football. The first score is like a big hello from the game, telling everyone, \\"Hey! The game has started, and it's going to be fun!\\" But how can we find out the first score of this particular game? Well, it is as simple as asking someone who was there, maybe a grown-up who watched the game or a friend who knows about it. If that doesn't work, we can turn to the magical world of the Internet, where lots of friendly, helpful people share information about games and scores. Remember, the first score can happen in the blink of an eye. A player can make it in just a few minutes or even seconds after the game starts. And no matter which team scores it, the first score is always special because it sets the tone for the game. It can make the crowd and the players very happy and inspired.

The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching). - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\" - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War . - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized. - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare. - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery. - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.

They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","response":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To clarify, the original process described is the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. The presence of frequent hurricanes in the area is not directly related to the process of blood sugar regulation. However, it could have indirect effects on this process. Frequent hurricanes could lead to factors such as increased stress, disrupted access to healthy food, or diminished ability to maintain a consistent routine for exercise and nutrition. These factors can indirectly impact blood sugar regulation by influencing diet, activity levels, and overall health. For example, stress can cause elevated cortisol levels, which can contribute to increased blood sugar levels. While the presence of hurricanes does not directly influence any specific step of the blood sugar regulation process, it can indirectly impact the process by altering the conditions that affect a person's ability to maintain healthy blood sugar levels."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"\\"Junior\\" Laemmle persuaded his father to bring Universal up to date.

A:","response":"\\"Henry Perenara\\" belongs to the category of \\"Athlete\\". Henry Perenara is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer and current rugby league referee. He played for several clubs in the National Rugby League (NRL) including the New Zealand Warriors and Melbourne Storm during his career as a player in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Later on, he transitioned into a refereeing role and has officiated various high-profile games in the NRL. Perenara was a versatile player who was capable in a number of positions, although he was typically deployed as a second-rower. He was known for his physical playing style and tireless work ethic, both of which served him well throughout his career. After retiring from playing, Perenara rapidly rose through the ranks of rugby league's officiating ranks to become an NRL referee, and he has displayed the same dedication and professionalism in this role that he was known for as a player. Although Perenara was not born in New Zealand but in Australia, he identifies as Maori and represented the New Zealand Kiwis at the international level as a player, thus he is counted among New Zealand's sporting figures. Despite the intense on-field pressure that comes with both playing and officiating, Perenara has successfully adapted to the changing demands of his roles within the sport and continues to contribute to rugby league at the highest level. His journey from player to referee provides an interesting insight into the transition that can occur when an athlete's playing career comes to a close, and the unique perspective that a former player can bring to officiating in a top-level competition. It's important to note that while many athletes struggle to find a new role after their playing days are over, Perenara has shown how it's possible to remain involved with the sport and provides a model for those still involved in their playing careers to consider when they think about life after rugby. So, in summary, Henry Perenara is the name of an individual who has been extensively involved in professional rugby, both as a player and a referee, hence the reason the name fits into the \\"athlete\\" category."},{"question":"Given the question: Laleta is a village in the municipality of Goražde Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Given the context: How would you describe Carson? Possible answers: reduce the suitcase's weight, someone who does not read instrucions, someone who likes to do well","response":"Carson can be described as someone who may overlook details and could benefit from being more attentive to instructions. In the context of exceeding the weight limit allowed for his suitcase, several factors could have contributed to this situation. Firstly, Carson may not have thoroughly read or understood the instructions and weight restrictions provided by the airline. This could have led him to pack more items than allowed, making his suitcase heavier than the specified limit. In this case, Carson can be described as someone who does not read instructions carefully or someone who is not detail-oriented. Secondly, Carson's behavior could also be attributed to a desire to be well-prepared for his trip. This means that he might have packed more items than necessary to ensure that he has everything he needs, even if it means going over the weight limit. In this sense, Carson can be regarded as someone who likes to do well and values preparedness, indicating that his intentions are good but need to be balanced with the requirements and restrictions of air travel. To address this issue, Carson should reduce the weight of his suitcase to meet the airline's requirements. This could involve removing any excess items that are not essential for his trip or considering alternative options such as shipping some belongings separately. Additionally, Carson should pay more attention to the guidelines and instructions provided by the airline in the future to avoid similar situations and to ensure a smoother traveling experience. In conclusion, Carson can be described as a combination of someone who might not be as attentive to instructions as needed and someone who likes to be well-prepared for various situations. By focusing on improving his attention to detail and adhering to the rules set by airlines, Carson can strike a balance between being prepared and following guidelines, ultimately ensuring a hassle-free travel experience."},{"question":"Solve -273 = -841*z + 834*z for z.","response":"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we're reading a fun story! We have this equation: -273 = -841*z + 834*z First, let's see what happens when we have -841*z and 834*z together. It's just like having -841 apples and 834 apples.

Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would... answer the following question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928?

Fortuyn was often regarded as controversial due to his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \\"a backward culture\\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. In 1992 Fortuyn wrote \\"Aan het volk van Nederland\\" (To the people of the Netherlands), declaring he was the successor to the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch politician Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. A one-time communist and former member of the social-democratic Labour Party, Fortuyn was elected \\"lijsttrekker\\" of the newly formed Livable Netherlands party by a large majority on 26 November 2001, prior to the Dutch general election of 2002. On 9 February 2002, he was interviewed by the Volkskrant, a Dutch newspaper (see below). His statements were considered so controversial that the party dismissed him as lijsttrekker the next day. Fortuyn had said that he favoured putting an end to Muslim immigration, if possible and wanted to abolish Article 1 of the Dutch constitution, the equality before the law. Having been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11 February 2002. Many Livable Netherlands supporters transferred their support to the new party. Heading the list of the Livable Rotterdam party, a local issues party, he achieved a major victory in the Rotterdam municipal council elections in early March 2002. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For the first time since the Second World War, the Labour Party was out of power in Rotterdam. Fortuyn's victory made him the subject of hundreds of interviews during the next three months, and he made many statements about his political ideology. In March he released his book The Mess of Eight Purple Years (De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars), which he used as his political agenda for the upcoming general election.

Justification: The smallest positive integer is 1. The first prime number is the smallest number which has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The first prime number is 2, as it can only be divided by 1 and 2 without leaving any remainder. Therefore, the sum of these two numbers is 1 + 2 = 3. However, the given answer is 2, so we need to creatively modify this question to fit the answer. Modified Question: Subtract the unique even prime number from the smallest positive odd integer. Justification: The unique even prime number is 2 (since it has only two divisors: 1 and 2). The smallest positive odd integer is 1. Subtracting the unique even prime number (2) from the smallest positive odd integer (1) gives the answer 1 - 2 = -1. To fit the given answer of 2, we can use the absolute value function. Final Question: What is the absolute value of the result when subtracting the unique even prime number from the smallest positive odd integer? Final Justification: |1-2| = |-1| = 2. The answer is 2, which matches the given answer."},{"question":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who gave up the conductorship of the Purcell Singers in 1967? ? Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

This technique is widely used in the printing industry for various purposes, including the creation of special effects, enhanced security features, and the correction of errors. Below are some examples of how overprinting is used: 1. Security Features: Overprint can be used to add unique holographic images, watermarks, or microtext patterns to important documents such as banknotes, passports, or certificates. These added security features make it difficult for counterfeiters to produce forgeries. 2. Error Correction: If there is a mistake on a printed material that has already been printed, an overprint can be applied to correct the error without having to reprint the entire batch. This can save significant time and money for the printer. 3. Visual Effects: Overprinting different colors of ink can create unique visual effects that enhance the aesthetics of the printed material. For instance, when two transparent inks are overprinted, the overlaps may produce a third color. This is often used in the creation of high-quality artworks and posters. 4. Postage Stamps: Overprints are commonly used to update or modify postage stamps. For example, when a country changes its currency or when there's a temporary shortage of a particular stamp denomination, overprints may be applied to existing stamps to denote the new value or to mark them as valid for use. 5. Promotional Materials: Overprints can be used on promotional materials such as brochures, flyers, or business cards. By adding a special promotion, limited-time offer, or event information, these materials can be updated or customized without having to redesign and reprint the entire piece. Overall, overprinting is an important technique in the printing industry that offers practical solutions for correcting errors, enhancing security features, creating visually appealing effects, and updating printed materials efficiently."},{"question":"Make use of the article to answer the questions.

Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences. - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - A Singspiel (plural: Singspiele; literally \\"sing-play\\") is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil. History. Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word \\"Singspiel\\" is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations. - A tradition is a belief or behavior passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. Common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings. Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of yearsthe word \\"tradition\\" itself derives from the Latin \\"tradere\\" or \\"traderer\\" literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways. - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art. - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral. - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - One Thousand and One Nights (\\"kitb alf layla wa-layla\\") is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as \\"The Arabian Nights' Entertainment\\". - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin. - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Abu Hassan is a comic opera in one act by Carl Maria von Weber to a German libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer , based on a story in One Thousand and One Nights . It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue . The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style . - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet. - An aria (plural: \\"arie\\" , or \\"arias\\" in common usage, diminutive form arietta or ariette) in music was originally any expressive melody, usually, but not always, performed by a singer. The term became used almost exclusively to describe a self-contained piece for one voice, with or without orchestral accompaniment, normally part of a larger work. The typical context for arias is opera, but vocal arias also feature in oratorios and cantatas, sharing features of the operatic arias of their periods. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage, an orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage facilities for costumes and set building. While some venues are constructed specifically for operas, other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers. - A critic is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from critical thinking or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (18 or 19 November 1786 5 June 1826) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, guitarist and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. - Recitative (also known by its Italian name \\"recitativo\\") is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.

A. give B. swim C. bring D. drop E. eat The best answer is A:","response":"The best answer to the question \\"The selfish man liked to take food from potlucks, but what didn't he do with food?\\" is A: give. The context of the question suggests the man's selfishness in relation to his behavior concerning food and potlucks, which are gatherings where each guest contributes a dish to be shared among the group. As a selfish man, he likes to take food from potlucks because it benefits him. He enjoys having a variety of dishes to choose from and filling his plate with an assortment of tasty treats. However, his selfish nature means that he isn't inclined to give or contribute food to the event. He takes advantage of the generosity and efforts of others, likely showing up empty-handed and still expecting to partake in the collective feast. By not giving or sharing food, he is exemplifying his selfishness in this situation. The other options in the question (B: swim, C: bring, D: drop, and E: eat) either do not make sense in this context or are not directly related to the selfish nature of the man: B: Swim isn't related to the context, as it involves a completely unrelated activity with no connection to food or potlucks. C: Bring is indirectly related to the topic, but it doesn't explicitly address the man's selfishness in this situation. One could bring food to a potluck without necessarily sharing it with others. D: Drop is also not directly related to the man's selfishness. While dropping food might be seen as careless or accidental, it isn't a clear indication of selfish behavior with regards to potlucks. E: Eat doesn't capture the essence of the question, as the man does eat food--in fact, he enjoys taking and consuming food at potlucks. The question aims to identify the specific behavior he doesn't engage in due to his selfishness, which is giving or sharing food."},{"question":"Article: This is where wiring comes in from the ignition module.

Given the question \\"Why did Kai do this?\\", is \\"did this to be rude\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"No, \\"did this to be rude\\" cannot be considered a valid answer in this context. Kai's intention behind buying Remy ice cream was to cheer him up, which reflects an empathetic and caring attitude. Therefore, it is clear that Kai's motivation was not to be rude, but rather to offer comfort and support. Instead, a more appropriate response could be, \\"Kai did this to lift Remy's spirits and make him feel better.\\" This answer accurately captures Kai's motive and highlights the positive intentions behind his action. Kai's decision to buy ice cream for Remy is rooted in their relationship and an understanding of Remy's emotions. It is common for people to offer comfort or attempt to cheer others up by providing them with something they enjoy, in this case, ice cream. Such gestures are aimed at making the receiver feel cared for and valued, which is quite the opposite of being rude or inconsiderate. In conclusion, \\"did this to be rude\\" is not a valid answer because it contradicts the purpose of Kai's action. His intention was to bring happiness to Remy, not to offend or annoy him. The correct interpretation acknowledges Kai's empathetic motivation and desire to improve Remy's mood."},{"question":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Once more, Mckiernan not only brought me into a world he created but kept me in that world, with the characters, the believability, and lastly the sheer excitment.

This task requires understanding the principles of physics, such as force, weight distribution, and stability. Let's break down the task step-by-step and explain the reasoning behind each step. Step 1: Identify the purpose and requirements A bridge is designed to connect two points across a gap, such as a river or a valley. The goal is to create a stable structure that can safely support a predetermined load, such as vehicles, pedestrians, or machinery. Consider the specific needs of the project: distance spanned, expected loads, and environmental factors. Step 2: Select the appropriate materials Based on the requirements, choose materials that provide the necessary strength, durability, and weight support. Common choices include steel, concrete, wood, and cable. Consider the cost, availability, and environmental factors when selecting materials. Step 3: Choose a bridge type Different bridge types suit different situations. Common types include beam, truss, arch, suspension, and cable-stayed bridges. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, so consider the purpose, materials, and environmental factors when selecting the best fit. Step 4: Calculate force and weight distribution Analyze the expected loads on the bridge and calculate the force and weight distribution to ensure its stability. Utilize principles of physics, such as tension, compression, and torsion, and consider factors like wind, temperature changes, and natural disasters. Make note of key points where forces converge, as these will require additional reinforcement. Step 5: Design the bridge Combine the information from the previous steps to create a detailed design of the bridge, complete with measurements, materials, and structural elements. Make sure to account for the force and weight distribution, reinforcement, and safety features. Step 6: Build a model or simulation (optional) Build a scale model or create a computer simulation of the bridge design to test its stability, load-bearing capacity, and other physical properties. This step helps to identify any potential issues before construction. Step 7: Construct the bridge Follow the design plans to construct the bridge, paying close attention to the details, materials, and reinforcements. During construction, regular inspections and tests should be conducted to ensure the safety and quality of the structure. By completing this task, a person demonstrates their ability to apply physical reasoning, as they need to understand and apply the principles of physics to design and build a stable, safe, and functional bridge."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Room doctors and medical groups around the world last weekend reacted with strong opposition to the news that an Italian specialist is _ cloning the first human baby. Dr. Severino Antinori, who is head of a hospital in Rome, has been referred to in an Arab newspaper claiming that one of his parents is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned baby. Antinori refused to comment on the reports, but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo for implantation with two years. So far seven different kinds of animals have already successfully been cloned, including sheep, cats and most recently rabbits. Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admitted that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a worldwide ban on the practice. Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, \\"I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby. It is using humans as guinea pigs . It makes people feel sick.\\" But Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute at Darmouth College in the USA, said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth. So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders, many of them dying soon after their birth. Doctors are opposed to human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one. \\"There are no benefits of cloned human beings, just harm,\\" said Dr. Michael Wilks of the U.K. Question: What would be the best title for the passage?

More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and film producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a \\"maverick\\" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. - Assassination is the murder of a prominent person, often a political leader or ruler, usually for political reasons or payment. - An underground film is a film that is out of the mainstream either in its style, genre, or financing. - John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor, producer, dancer, and singer. Travolta first became known in the 1970s, after appearing on the television series \\"Welcome Back, Kotter\\" (19751979) and starring in the box office successes \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Grease\\" (1978). His acting career declined through the 1980s, but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s with his role in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994), and he has since starred in films such as \\"Face/Off\\" (1997), \\"Swordfish\\" (2001), \\"Wild Hogs\\", and \\"Hairspray\\" (both 2007). - A cult following is a group of fans who are highly dedicated to a work of culture. A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, will be said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a community. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - Alicia Christian \\"Jodie\\" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress and filmmaker who has worked in films and on television.

Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films. - Art historians and philosophers of art have long had classificatory disputes about art regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as art. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today. - A talent agent, or booking agent, is a person who finds jobs for actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, professional athletes, writers, screenwriters, broadcast journalists, and other people in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more. - In the motion picture industry, a \\"box office bomb\\" or \\"box office flop\\" is a film that is viewed as highly unsuccessful or unprofitable during its theatrical run, sometimes preceding hype regarding its cost, production, or marketing efforts. Generally, any film for which the production and marketing costs exceed the combined revenue recovered after release is considered to have \\"bombed\\". - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. He is considered part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking. - Jonathan Kaplan (born November 25, 1947) is an American film producer and director. His film \\"The Accused\\" (1988) earned actress Jodie Foster her first Oscar for Best Actress and was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. Kaplan received five Emmy nominations for his roles directing and producing \\"ER\\". - The Golden Bear is the highest prize awarded for the best film at the Berlin International Film Festival. The bear is the heraldic animal of Berlin, featured on both the coat of arms and flag of Berlin. - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. - George Litto is an American film producer and talent agent . His production credits include Robert Altman 's Thieves Like Us ( 1974 ) , Jonathan Kaplan 's cult film Over the Edge ( 1979 ) , and three Brian De Palma thrillers , Obsession ( 1976 ) , Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) and Blow Out ( 1981 ) . - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - John Arthur Lithgow (; born , 1945) is an American actor, musician, singer, and author. He has received two Tony Awards, five Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, an American Comedy Award, four Drama Desk Awards and has also been nominated for two Academy Awards and four Grammy Awards. Lithgow has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. - A cult film, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \\"cult film\\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \\"cult\\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that. - The Academy Award for Best Director (officially known as the Academy Award for Best Directing) is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - New Hollywood, sometimes referred to as the \\"American New Wave\\", refers to a period in American film history from the mid-to-late 1960s (\\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"The Graduate\\") to the early 1980s (\\"Heaven's Gate\\", \\"One from the Heart\\") when a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence in United States, influencing the types of films produced, their production and marketing, and the way major studios approached film-making. In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. \\"New Hollywood\\" usually refers to a period of film-making rather than a style of film-making, though it can be referred to as a movement. The films made in this era are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms. - Dennis Franz Schlachta (born October 28, 1944), known professionally as Dennis Franz, is an American actor best known for his role as hard-boiled NYPD Detective Andy Sipowicz in the 19932005 ABC television series \\"NYPD Blue\\", and Lt. Norman Buntz (19851987) in the similar NBC series \\"Hill Street Blues\\" and its short-lived spinoff, \\"Beverly Hills Buntz\\". What is the relationship between 'george litto' and 'philadelphia'? A:","response":"George Litto was an American film producer and talent agent whose production credits include several notable films, such as Robert Altman's \\"Thieves Like Us\\" (1974), Jonathan Kaplan's cult film \\"Over the Edge\\" (1979), and three Brian De Palma thrillers, \\"Obsession\\" (1976), \\"Dressed to Kill\\" (1980), and \\"Blow Out\\" (1981). \\"Blow Out\\" is the film that brings the connection between George Litto and Philadelphia. The movie stars John Travolta as Jack Terry, a movie sound effects technician from Philadelphia who inadvertently captures audio evidence of an assassination involving a presidential hopeful while recording sounds for a low-budget slasher film. In this context, Philadelphia serves as the setting where the central character, played by Travolta, is based and where the plot of the film unfolds.

The top that Elena borrowed from Cynthia barely fit over her, as Available choices: * Elena was much wider in the torso. * Cynthia was much wider in the torso.","response":"The top that Elena borrowed from Cynthia barely fit over her, as Cynthia was much wider in the torso. In order to continue this story, I will break down the steps that I will follow: 1. Set up the context and describe the situation where Elena is borrowing the top. 2. Develop the characters by adding their thoughts and emotions. 3. Introduce a conflict between the characters or the scenario. 4. Create a resolution or a reaction to the conflict. Now proceeding with the story: Elena and Cynthia had been friends for years, and they occasionally swapped clothes for special occasions. This time, Elena needed something for a last-minute dinner party, and Cynthia was happy to lend her a hand. They rummaged through Cynthia's closet, where Elena found a beautiful silk top that seemed to be perfect for the event. As Elena tried on the top borrowed from Cynthia, she noticed that it was tighter around her torso than expected. Even though they were close friends, they never really addressed the differences in their body shapes, and it was evident at this moment. Elena was aware that Cynthia was wider in the torso compared to her, but she didn't expect such a notable difference. She gently tugged at the fabric, attempting not to stretch it or cause any damage. Seeing Elena struggle with the top, Cynthia noticed the issue as well. The situation was a bit uncomfortable for both of them, but they had been friends long enough to tackle such moments gracefully. Cynthia quickly stepped in, trying to lighten the mood. \\"Oh, that one must have shrunk after I washed it,\\" she said with a chuckle. \\"Let's try another one, shall we?\\" Together, Elena and Cynthia continued searching through the closet and found another top that fit much better. The two friends shared a laugh and moved forward, cherishing their enduring bond despite their differences. And with that, Elena was all set and prepared to dazzle everyone at the dinner party."},{"question":"On a scale from 0-5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", how similar is the sentence \\"The researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue where the tumors had been.\\" to the sentence \\"No tumors were detected; rather, empty cavities and scar tissue were found in their place.\\"?","response":"The similarity between the two sentences can be rated as a 4.5 on a scale from 0 to 5. These two sentences convey the same idea – the absence of tumors and the presence of empty cavities and scar tissue instead. The following factors contribute to their similarity: 1. Meaning: Both sentences convey that the researchers did not find any tumors, but instead discovered empty cavities and scar tissue. 2. Structure: Both sentences use a cause-and-effect structure or contrast to show the relationship between the expected tumors and the actual findings. The conjunctions \\"only\\" and \\"rather\\" serve to establish this contrast. 3. Vocabulary: The key terms that define the subject of the sentences - \\"empty cavities,\\" \\"scar tissue,\\" and \\"tumors\\" - are present in both sentences, and their usage establishes the context of the findings. 4. Length: Both sentences are roughly the same length and complexity, making them comparable in their overall scope and presentation of the topic. However, there are some minor differences between the sentences that prevent them from being rated a perfect 5 in similarity: 1. Wording: The first sentence uses \\"The researchers found\\" whereas the second one begins with \\"No tumors were detected.\\" While the meaning is very similar, the phrasing is not identical. 2. Sequence: The sentences present the information in a slightly different order, with the first sentence placing emphasis on the researchers, and the second sentence focusing immediately on the lack of tumor detection. In summary, despite these minor differences, the two sentences can be considered very similar in terms of meaning, structure, vocabulary, and length. Therefore, they receive a rating of 4.5 for similarity."},{"question":"Q: Is this product review positive? Title: LOVE THIS STUFF Review: This is my 3rd or 4th case!

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Options: - top piece - strong - win - total domination - best Step-by-step reasoning process below:","response":"It seems like the goal of the board game is to defeat your opponent and be the ultimate winner. To analyze the given options and determine which one would come out on top, let's review each option and its implications individually: 1. Top piece: This option suggests that the most important or highest-ranking game piece should be the one to triumph. While this may be true in some games, the game's instructions simply state that the goal is to \\"conquer the opponent.\\" This option does not explicitly refer to winning the game or completely dominating the rival player, so it might not be the best answer. 2. Strong: Choosing the \\"strong\\" option means that the player must be strong, either tactically or through their game pieces. In the context of a board game, this might translate to a player who can successfully navigate obstacles and overpower their opponent. While being strong can certainly contribute to winning, it's still not a clear-cut answer. 3. Win: This option seems to be the most straightforward and focuses on the ultimate goal - winning the game. By conquering the opponent, a player can achieve victory and be considered the best player. 4. Total domination: This option implies that the player must completely overpower and control their opponent's actions or territory. While this can be an effective strategy in some games, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a win; total domination might simply imply that one player has a significant advantage over the other, but it doesn't outright declare the victorious player. 5. Best: This option suggests that the best or most skilled player will come out on top. While this is generally the case, it does not explicitly mention the process of winning the game or conquering the opponent. Based on the step-by-step reasoning process: - Options 1 (Top piece) and 5 (Best) do not directly address the goal of conquering the opponent. - Option 2 (Strong) is a contributing factor to winning but does not present the final outcome. - Option 4 (Total domination) might demonstrate a player's advantage but does not necessarily guarantee victory. Thus, when considering the options provided, the answer that most closely aligns with the game's instructions is option 3, \\"win.\\" By conquering their opponent, a player can achieve the goal of winning the game and coming out on top."},{"question":"Answer this question.

After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice have fewer places to hide. Which is most likely to happen after the crops are gathered? Pick the answer from these options","response":"Unfortunately, the options to choose from are not provided in your question. Nonetheless, I can still provide you with a detailed answer about the scenario you've presented. After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice will have fewer places to hide. This change in the environment affects both the mice and the owl that rely on the field for survival. In situations like this, several outcomes are possible: 1. The owl's hunting efficiency increases: As the mice lose their hiding spots, it becomes easier for the owl to spot, catch, and eat them. This leads to the owl being more effective as a predator and potentially catching more mice than it did before the crops were harvested. 2. The mice population may initially decrease: As the owl's hunting efficiency increases, the mice population could initially decline. Fewer hiding places make it difficult for the mice to escape predators, and as a result, their numbers might diminish. 3. Adaptation in the mice behavior and habitat: Over time, the mice may learn to adapt to the new environment. They could change their behavior – for example, becoming more nocturnal – or move to other nearby areas offering better hiding spots and resources. This can help them avoid predation and maintain their population. 4. The owl might change its hunting strategy or behavior: If the owl's primary food source becomes scarce due to a decline in the mice population or a shift in the mice's habits or habitat, the owl may need to find other food sources or change its hunting strategy. Owls are adaptable predators, and they might also start hunting in different locations or move their territory in search of more abundant prey. 5. Balance in the ecosystem: Over time, the ecosystem may reach a new balance. As the organisms involved (the owl and mice in this case) adapt to the changes in the environment, they may find a new equilibrium that allows both populations to coexist. If the mice were overpopulating the field before the crops were gathered, the increased hunting efficiency of the owl might help to maintain a healthier balance between predators and prey. In conclusion, after the farmer gathers the crops, and the mice have fewer places to hide, the most likely outcome is that the owl's hunting efficiency will increase, leading to a potential initial decrease in the mice population. However, various adaptations and adjustments in both the owl's and the mice's behavior could help maintain a balanced ecosystem in the long term."},{"question":"Given a story, answer the question about the story.

The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters. Which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock?","response":"To determine which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock, we need few considerations, such as the length of the divergent plate boundaries, rate of seafloor spreading, and the geological dynamics of the two oceans. Let's analyze this in detail: 1. Divergent Plate Boundaries: At divergent plate boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other, allowing magma to rise from the mantle and cool off to create new oceanic crust. As mentioned, the Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate boundary, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates. 2. Length of Divergent Plate Boundaries: The length of these boundaries may contribute to the amount of magma cooling that takes place. The inactive Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean spreads across 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) from north of Greenland towards Russia. In comparison, the seven divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific Ocean, which include the well-known East Pacific Rise and other mid-ocean ridges, span for several thousand kilometers. This makes the total length of divergent plate boundaries much larger in the Pacific Ocean compared to the Arctic Ocean. 3. Seafloor Spreading Rate: The rate at which seafloor spreading occurs impacts the amount of molten rock that cools at divergent plate boundaries. The Arctic Ocean's Gakkel Ridge is considered a slow-spreading ridge, with an average spreading rate of less than 10 millimeters per year. In contrast, the Pacific Ocean's main divergent plate boundary, the East Pacific Rise, has a much faster spreading rate that ranges from 50 to 200 millimeters per year. The faster the spreading rate, the more magma rises and cools off at the boundary, forming new oceanic crust. 4. Geological Dynamics: The Pacific Ocean's tectonic plate boundaries are much more active compared to the Arctic Ocean. The plate interactions in the Pacific Ocean result in more volcanic activity, earthquakes, and hydrothermal vent formation. This, in turn, leads to a greater amount of molten rock cooling at divergent plate boundaries in the form of volcanic rocks, such as basalt. The Arctic Ocean, being tectonically less active and having a dormant ridge system, experiences less cooling of the molten rock at its single divergent plate boundary. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the length and number of divergent plate boundaries, seafloor spreading rate, and geological dynamics, it can be concluded that the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock compared to the Arctic Ocean. The larger number of divergent plate boundaries, their more significant length, and the faster spreading rates, combined with the higher tectonic activity of the Pacific Ocean, contribute to this outcome."},{"question":"Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. suppose there is a natural disturbance happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","response":"In the event of a natural disturbance, it can affect the recycling process of aluminum cans in several ways. The supposed perturbation could either be directly impacting a step of the process, indirectly impacting a step of the process, or not impacting any step at all. In this answer, I will discuss each type of perturbation in detail and provide possible scenarios. 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: A natural disturbance may directly impact a step of aluminum cans recycling process by causing damage to essential facilities or infrastructure involved in the process. For instance, a natural disaster such as a flood, earthquake, or hurricane could result in severe damage to the recycling facilities, disrupting recycling operations temporarily or even permanently. In this scenario, the recycling process will be halted until necessary repairs to the facilities and infrastructure are made. This leads to a subsequent decrease in aluminum cans being processed and recycled, and may also lead to inefficiencies in the overall recycling process. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Natural disturbances can also have indirect effects on the recycling process by causing disruptions to transportation, communications, or other supporting systems. For example, a heavy storm or snowfall may block roads and disrupt the transportation of aluminum cans to the recycling facility. Similarly, a power outage during a natural disaster may affect the operation of sorting and cleaning machines. These indirect impacts can delay the whole process and lead to a temporary reduction in the number of aluminum cans being recycled. Over time, these cans may be sent to landfills or incinerated if the disturbance persists or if collection and recycling systems become overloaded by the excessive number of accumulated materials. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: It's also possible that a natural disturbance may not affect the aluminum recycling process at all. Some natural disturbances, such as a light rainstorm or a minor localized event, may not have any significant impact on the recycling infrastructure or the processes involved. In this scenario, the recycling of aluminum cans would continue without any disruptions, meaning that there would be no significant changes to the number of aluminum cans being recycled, provided that the affected areas can recover quickly and efficiently from the disturbance. In conclusion, natural disturbances can affect the aluminum can recycling process in various ways, depending on the severity and type of disturbance. It could either directly impact a step of the process, indirectly impact a step of the process, or not impact the process at all. Identifying the specific perturbation allows for better planning and mitigation strategies to ensure minimal disruption to the aluminum recycling process and its environmental benefits."},{"question":"Solve 760*y + 1664 = 696*y for y.","response":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this together!

This will help us know how many more jellybeans we have. 760y - 696y + 1664 = 696y - 696y When you take away 696 jellybeans times y from both sides, you will have: 64y + 1664 = 0 Now, it looks like this: you have 64 jellybeans times y plus 1664 candies equals zero. Let's find out how many jellybeans are in y. To do that, we need to move the candies to the other side. So, we take away 1664 candies from both sides: 64y = -1664 Now we only have 64 jellybeans times y on one side equals negative 1664 candies. We're close! Last step is to find out what y is by dividing both sides by 64: y = -1664 ÷ 64 Now, after doing this division, we find out: y = -26 So, our special number y is -26, which means minus 26.

Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.

The van has a Kansas tag number: QKP711. By Dave Faherty and Trish Williford Thursday update: Police said they do not plan to file charges against a Salisbury woman who disappeared on the morning she was scheduled for a C-section. Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther was found in Boone six days after she disappeared from her home. Channel 9 has been asking her family for more information about her baby. Her brother said they're no longer expecting a new addition to the family but police have not said what happened to the child or if Bradshaw-Crowther was pregnant to begin with. 'No new addition to the family' after missing pregnant woman found, brother says One day after a missing Salisbury woman was finally found safe, her family talked to Channel 9 to address the question on the minds of many. “Is Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther's baby OK?” Channel 9 reporter Trish Williford asked. \\"Carrie is presently hospitalized and is receiving much needed medical care, while it is unfortunate we no longer expect a new addition to our family and ask for your continued prayers,\\" said Drew Bradshaw, Crowther's brother. Bradshaw didn't go into any detail about what actually happened to his sister's baby. Family members of Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther didn’t immediately return phone calls made by Channel 9 on Wednesday about the unborn child. Family members say the 49-year-old was scheduled for a C-section last Tuesday when she disappeared from her Salisbury home. Then, on Monday, authorities in Boone say Bradshaw-Crowther used her ATM card at a CVS store. They later found her at a gas station Bradshaw-Crowther was then taken to a hospital for observation. But her family didn't mention her baby until now. \\"Mr. Bradshaw, can you tell us if Carrie's baby died?” Williford asked. “I can't tell you more than that all I can say is we're not expecting any new addition to our family. We respect the HIPAA laws and we feel that releasing any more information should be in Carrie's discretion after she has had the opportunity to heal,\\" he said. Bradshaw thanked the police and the community for their support during this time. They say Bradshaw-Crowther is still recovering at a hospital. Search for Bradshaw-Crowther spanned multiple states (Photo taken by Steve Frank: GoBlueRidge.net) \\"I was very relieved it was a joy to find out Carrie was okay and alive and soon to be safe,” her brother Drew Bradshaw said. Family members had few answers Tuesday and wouldn’t say how her unborn baby was doing, or if she was actually pregnant. \\"Carrie is doing okay. She's in the hospital still being evaluated. We are unable to release a whole lot of information about that,\\" Drew Bradshaw said. The Watauga County Hospital she was taken to Monday said she had been discharged Tuesday. Her brother told Channel 9 his sister was admitted to another hospital, but wouldn’t say which one. However, he wanted to thank thousands of people who responded to our stories since last week. \\"We appreciate all the support, prayers, thoughts and concerns for Carrie,\\" he said. Channel 9 first broke the news that deputies found Bradshaw-Crowther Monday at a gas station in Boone in her Mazda MPV. Channel 9 partners GoBlueRidge.com sent photo of what appears to be Bradshaw-Crowther moments after she was found. Channel 9 asked police if she could face charges, in light of new information about the baby. Salisbury police spokeswoman Capt. Shelia Lingle, said in an email, “We are not looking to charge her for anything.” They referred Eyewitness News to the family for questions about the baby. TIMELINE of the case Tuesday, June 2: Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther, 49, was scheduled to have a C-section Tuesday morning, according to daughter Laura Lusk. Lusk went to get gas before returning to take her mom to hospital, but she was gone Wednesday, June 3: Bradshaw-Crowther was spotted at a Statesville gas station. Police said they believe she spend at least one night at a hotel across the street. Sunday, June 7: Police obtained surveillance images from the Statesville gas station where she was last spotted Monday, June 8: Police located Bradshaw-Crowther at a Boone gas station after she used her ATM card at a nearby CVS store Police are not releasing any information about her pregnancy or the baby Tuesday, June 9: Officials report Bradshaw-Crowther was released from the hospital. Her brother said she was admitted to a different hospital sometime Tuesday. Bradshaw-Crowther 's family announced there would be no new addition to their family. When a deputy approached her she said, “I am Carrie.” It has been six days since anyone has seen the 49-year-old. She was scheduled to have a C-section because of a high-risk pregnancy Tuesday, but disappeared from her home in Salisbury. Police traced her car to the CVS in Boone and then called the store. \\"They called and said a suspicious woman had come in, but she didn't look exactly like her picture online. She had dark hair and looked about the same age but didn't look pregnant or anything like that,” said clerk Eva Clause. Family members, including her daughter, told Faherty they are going to Boone to be with her. “It's good news when we get her home. Thank you,” said Bradshaw-Crowther’s sister Amy. Bradshaw-Crowther’s sister sped away from the home anxious to check on her sister’s condition. Meanwhile, Salisbury police have a lot of questions about where she has been. Her daughter told Channel 9 she left her Salisbury home to get gas and when she returned her mother was gone. On Thursday, Bradshaw-Crowther was spotted a Statesville gas station. Police also believe she spent at least one night at a hotel across the street. Deputies said Tuesday there's nothing criminal with this case.

Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear. 'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something. It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette. All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat.

Answer:","response":"Since the walls were thin, Donald could hear Joel's squeaky bed frame so clearly that it seemed as if the noise was originating near him. It usually wouldn't bother him on ordinary days, but today was different. He had a critical presentation due in the morning, and he needed absolute concentration and peace for that. Not to mention, this wasn't the first time the squeaky bed frame invaded his ears and attempted to disrupt his peace of mind. On multiple occasions in the past, he tried to overlook and ignore it, but tonight, the situation was more pressing. With a sigh of annoyance, he tried to bear it for a few more minutes, hoping against all hope that the noise would subside on its own accord or Joel would realize it without any prompt. His hopes fell flat, and it spurred a sense of desperation and resentment in him. He knew he had to intervene and decided it was high time to address this issue. Shaking off the irritation, he drew in a deep breath, readying himself for the upcoming confrontation. Aware of the consequences that his reaction might result in, he made sure to compose himself and choose his words carefully. Clenching his fists, he rose from his chair, determination etching prominent lines on his forehead. His feet dragged across the floor, carrying him close to the shared wall. Frustration merged with his desperation to sleep peacefully as he raised his voice just loud enough for Joel to listen, trying to penetrate the thin wall with his resonant voice. This was uncharted territory for him, as he usually prefered to avoid conflicts but the circumstances called out for direct action, pushing him out of his comfort zone. Gritting his teeth, he finally mustered the courage and called out firmly, \\"Joel, please, could you do something about that bed of yours? I need silence.\\" Thus, option (A). Donald yelled for him to be quiet, seems to be the most accurate description of the situation and how it unfolded. Whether or not his cry for silence would bring about a change was yet to be seen, but at least for tonight, he had taken the step he thought was necessary. The interruption from his critical project undoubtedly broke his train of thought, but he found strange comfort in raising his voice against the concern, solving it once and for all. He proceeded back to his laptop, hoping to regain his lost focus and tie all the loose ends of his presentation together."},{"question":"The Giants blitzed the Scottish side by hitting six goals in the first period at Murrayfield Ice Rink.

Step 1: Understand the infield fly rule The infield fly rule is a rule in baseball and softball that is designed to prevent the defense from deliberately taking advantage of the baserunners, particularly when there is a potential for a double play. When the rule comes into effect, the batter is automatically out, regardless of whether the fielder catches the ball or not. Step 2: List the conditions required for the infield fly rule to come into effect The infield fly rule comes into effect when all of the following conditions are met: 1. There are fewer than two outs in the inning. 2. There are runners on first and second base, or bases loaded (runners on first, second, and third base). 3. The batter hits a fair ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, meaning it is neither a line drive nor a bunt.

The high expectations that had amassed due to the well-crafted promotional campaign were left completely unfulfilled, as the movie failed to deliver on every single fundamental aspect of a good film. Firstly, the incoherent script seemed to be the movie's greatest pitfall. A disjointed narrative with gaping plot holes marred the storytelling experience, leaving audiences utterly confused and frustrated. The poor dialogue failed to engage viewers and instead exacerbated an already dire cinematic experience. The characters were underdeveloped and one-dimensional, void of any real substance or evolution. This, combined with a lackluster plot, made it strikingly difficult for the audience to form any emotional connections with the protagonists. The exact nature of their motives was unclear, and as a result, viewers remained uninvested in the outcome of the movie. Furthermore, the actors delivered subpar performances that severely detracted from any potential enjoyment. Their wooden acting and forced interactions often verged on cringe-worthy, as the chemistry between the lead actors was practically non-existent. The use of age-old clichés and predictable character tropes further tainted the acting arsenal. Visually, \\"Fading Dreams\\" had a production value that appeared to be on par with a modest student film – a far cry from the high-quality visuals we have come to expect in today's competitive market. The uninspired cinematography failed to make the most of the locations or any special effects, and the overall aesthetic was poorly executed. To make matters worse, the movie's pacing was erratic and had a profoundly negative impact on the structure of the storyline. Numerous scenes were dragged out tediously, only to be followed by rushed and shallow resolutions; it was as if the film could not find a comfortable rhythm to maintain interest or engagement. While it is understandable that films sometimes miss their mark and fall short of expectations, \\"Fading Dreams\\" suffers from glaring issues in every conceivable aspect of a successful film. As a result, it leaves viewers questioning their time investment and lamenting the potential of what could have been. In summary, \\"Fading Dreams\\" is an unmitigated cinematic catastrophe that stands as a testament to poor writing, deficient character development, and weak direction. It is a disappointing effort that should be avoided at all costs for anyone hoping to enjoy a fulfilling and thought-provoking movie experience. A film enthusiasts' nightmare, it sullies the very essence of what filmmaking aims to achieve, leaving audiences with the bitter aftertaste of time wasted."},{"question":"A text is given in Hindi.

They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play.

On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again.

First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss. The answer is:","response":"The names of the people Flosshilde pretends to chastise are her sisters, Woglinde and Wellgunde."},{"question":"Two friends, John and Abe, worked at the same warehouse. John was exposed to very strong light all the time, while Abe worked in a more normal environment. John started experiencing health problems after a while. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which worker was exposed to less light pollution, John or Abe? Hint: Medical research on the effects of excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks[33] use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety.[34][35][36][37] Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety.[38] For those who need to be awake at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.[39]","response":"Based on the given paragraph and additional information, it can be concluded that Abe was exposed to less light pollution compared to John. The passage states that John was exposed to very strong light all the time, while Abe worked in a more normal environment. This difference in light exposure suggests that Abe experienced lesser light pollution in his working environment. The hint provided offers relevant information on the potential health effects of light pollution or over-illumination. Excessive exposure to strong light can have various adverse impacts on both physical and mental wellbeing. Studies have shown that inappropriate lighting can lead to increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decreased sexual function, and elevated anxiety levels. Furthermore, animal models also indicate that unavoidable light exposure can negatively affect mood and anxiety. For individuals who need to be awake at night, the presence of light at night can have an immediate impact on alertness and mood. This information corroborates the notion that exposure to excessive light, as experienced by John, can lead to the development of health problems over time, as mentioned in the initial paragraph. In conclusion, among the two workers, Abe was exposed to less light pollution in his working environment. Due to his exposure to more normal lighting conditions, Abe likely experienced fewer associated adverse health effects compared to John, who faced health issues presumably due to the excessive light in his work surroundings. It is essential to consider appropriate lighting design to promote optimal occupational health and wellbeing, as highlighted in the referenced medical research and lighting design textbooks."},{"question":"Article:Mourne Search and Rescue say lifesaving riverside equipment is being thrown into the River Mourne in County Tyrone \\"at least twice weekly\\".

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

The drivers cannot afford the slightest mistake but can make a real difference.","response":"The topic of this discussion is the Suzuka Circuit in Japan: A challenging racetrack in the Formula 1 calendar where drivers need to exhibit exceptional skills and precision to tackle its technicality. The Suzuka Circuit has been an iconic racetrack in the Formula 1 calendar since 1987. It is located in Mie Prefecture in Japan and holds deep historical roots within the motorsport world. Just like Spa-Francorchamps Circuit in Belgium, the Suzuka Circuit is renowned for its challenging layout and has been the stage for some of the most thrilling and memorable races in F1 history. One of the key factors that contribute to the Suzuka Circuit's reputation as a challenging racetrack is its technical layout. The figure-eight configuration of the track covers a total distance of 5.807 kilometers (3.609 miles), with a striking mix of high- and low-speed corners, gradients, and challenging sequences of turns that demand an unyielding focus from the drivers. The signature features of the Suzuka Circuit include: 1. Esses: A complex series of high-speed, left-right turns that require rapid directional changes with excellent car balance to maintain maximum speed. 2. Degner Curve: A high-speed right-hander (Degner 1), followed by a much slower left-hander (Degner 2). This section necessitates accurate braking and precise car placement to avoid running wide or hitting the unforgiving gravel trap. 3. Hairpin: A tight hairpin bend, which tests the drivers' ability to find the optimal braking point and apex, while simultaneously being cautious of overtaking attempts from the competitors. 4. Spoon Curve: One of the most well-known sections of the track, is a double-apex left-hander where drivers have to be patient with the throttle to avoid losing valuable time on corner exit. 5. 130R: Named after its original 130-meter radius, this is a high-speed left-hander and one of the fastest corners in the world of motorsports. It requires immense courage and depicts the driver's sheer commitment. The Suzuka Circuit demands drivers to have a high level of expertise; the slightest mistake at any corner can result in severe consequences, resulting in loss of positions, or even worse, a race-ending accident. However, the intricate nature of the track also gives drivers an opportunity to showcase their skills and make a real difference through exceptional car control, tire management, and overtaking maneuvers. Over the years, the Suzuka Circuit has witnessed some epic battles, memorable championship deciders, and excellent individual performances by some of the best drivers in the world. One such example is the legendary Ayrton Senna, who won at Suzuka four times, with three of those victories (1988, 1990, and 1991) helping him secure his three World Championships. In conclusion, the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, along with the Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, ranks among the more challenging and cherished racetracks on the F1 calendar. The drivers need to be at their absolute best to navigate through the technical and demanding layout, with no room for error if they want to emerge victorious. The Japanese circuit is a true test of a driver's talent, perseverance, and ability to make a real difference, earning its rightful place in the pantheon of legendary motor racing venues."},{"question":"How is \\"(Applause)\\" said in Czech?","response":"In Czech, \\"(Applause)\\" can be translated as \\"(Potlesk)\\". The word \\"potlesk\\" comes from the verb \\"tleskat,\\" which means \\"to clap\\" or \\"to applaud.\\" Czech is a West Slavic language and is the official language of the Czech Republic. It's spoken by about 10 million people, primarily residing in the Czech Republic, and has some speakers in neighboring countries like Poland, Germany, and Austria. Usage of \\"(Potlesk)\\" in the context of scripts, dialogues, or transcriptions, serves as an indication of the audience's reaction, similar to how \\"(Applause)\\" is used in English texts. It's essential to note that this term denotes the act of applauding or clapping, rather than instructing an individual to clap or applaud. When you come across the term \\"(Potlesk)\\" in a Czech text, it usually means that the audience appreciated, approved or enjoyed the performance, talk, or statement made by the speaker. In informal conversations or casual settings, people might use the term \\"tleskni!\\" or \\"zatleskej!\\" to encourage someone to clap or to say \\"give a round of applause.\\" The Czech language can be rich in expression, and you may find other phrases or idioms used to portray the act of applauding. In conclusion, the term \\"(Applause)\\" is translated to \\"(Potlesk)\\" in Czech. It is used to reflect the act of clapping or demonstrating appreciation towards a performance or statement. Just like in English, it serves as a common way to indicate audience response within the context of scripts, dialogues, or transcripts."},{"question":"The inspector judged it to be a copy, it was not a what of the original artist? - creation - hatred - paste - soft copy - unique The best answer is Answer:","response":"Step 1: Understand the question The inspector's judgment is focused on the work being a copy, which means it is not an original work by the said artist.

Interestingly, the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's latest film entitled 'Offside', a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to. The odd thing is, you don't come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema (unless it's an education in Panahi's controversial style), but you do come away feeling enlightened, that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran, and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it. I can remember the 2006 World Cup, I'm sure many people can. It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year, a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic. Needless to say, I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain '82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria. Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBC's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game, both nations' first of the tournament, may remember that at the top of the show, the BBC's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match. It went something like: 'We've seen giants Germany, England, Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see.........Mexico and Iran battle it out'. The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore. It's a shame because there are people, and films like Offside present them, who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage. When immediately thinking of the words 'Iran', 'football' and 'World Cup', my mind flies back to the France '98 game between said nation and America. Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Iran's famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them, director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude. You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a Western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in. A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film 'Lagaan', in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket. Similalry, 2005's 'The Game of Their Lives' sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films and Offside are immense; Offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls, trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup, are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game. The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may', not will, but 'may' use during the game. The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahi's film was itself banned in Iran. But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones, two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'Offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play. The parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing (supposedly without right) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team; that being the state itself. I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that I've seen. It's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus, the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all. The immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful. I also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons I've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous, either that or you work in the Iranian government. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? Options: [+] negative [+] positive","response":"The sentiment of this review can be described as [+] positive. The reviewer provides a thorough analysis of the film and its themes, appreciates the raw acting and the neo-realist aura, and considers it one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? floating narrative Pick from: (I) negative (II) positive","response":"To determine the sentiment of the given review, I will analyze the words and consider their connotations. - The word \\"floating\\" could have various connotations, such as being disoriented, aimless, or unpredictable.

However, in general, it seems to lean more towards a negative connotation, as it suggests a lack of structure or coherence. - The word \\"narrative\\" itself is neutral, simply referring to the story or plot of the movie.

He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history. and a hint : Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since: Please answer this question : Which era would less likely be longer, era A or era B? Answer:","response":"Era A would less likely be longer than Era B, based on the information provided. Era A, marked by the flourishing of dinosaurs before 66 million years ago, refers to a period of time with relatively high biodiversity and evolutionary success for these creatures. This era includes the Mesozoic Era, which is further divided into three periods: the Triassic (252-201 million years ago), the Jurassic (201-145 million years ago), and the Cretaceous (145-66 million years ago). These periods saw the rapid diversification and dominance of dinosaurs in various environments, along with the evolution of many other species. On the other hand, Era B refers to the mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago, which marked the end of the Cretaceous Period and the Mesozoic Era. This extinction event is known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) Extinction, and it resulted in the loss of approximately 75% of all species on Earth, including non-avian dinosaurs. Mass extinctions, as pointed out in the hint, are periods of high extinction rates, with many species going extinct over a relatively short span of time. Such events usually represent an accumulation of smaller extinction-events, ultimately resulting in the decline of global biodiversity. Considering that Era A covers a more extended and stable period during which dinosaurs flourished and evolved, while Era B represents a comparatively short, catastrophic event with high extinction rates, it is less likely that Era A would be shorter in duration than Era B."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Columbia Air Lines' Flight 409 is a Boeing 747-100 on a red-eye route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time. Patroni and Murdock take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake. En route, they communicate with Pryor, learning that the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, but it is inoperable for turns. The jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains, so Murdock starts to guide Pryor... The answer is:","response":"What challenges does Nancy Pryor face as she attempts to land the damaged Columbia 409 at Salt Lake City International Airport with the guidance of her boyfriend and chief flight instructor, Al Murdock, considering she has no prior flying experience and has to navigate through mountainous terrain with limited instrument visibility?"},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: no","response":"Question: Is it possible to safely watch a solar eclipse with the naked eye? Stream-of-consciousness explanation: A solar eclipse is a fascinating astronomical event that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth, casting a shadow on our planet. Observing a solar eclipse can be a unique and thrilling experience, but it also raises questions about safety precautions, especially concerning eye protection. It's crucial to keep in mind that looking directly at the Sun, whether or not it is partially or fully obscured by the Moon, can result in severe, permanent eye damage. The Sun emits harmful radiation, including ultraviolet and infrared rays, which can cause damage to the light-sensitive cells in the retina. The human eye doesn't have proper pain receptors, meaning that you wouldn't feel any pain while this kind of damage occurs, making it harder to notice until it's too late. To safely observe a solar eclipse, proper eye protection is essential. Standard sunglasses, no matter how dark, do not provide enough protection from harmful solar radiation. Instead, special-purpose solar filters or ISO-certified eclipse glasses are required to safely view an eclipse. These specialized glasses block harmful solar rays while allowing you to observe the solar eclipse. Please remember that it is also unsafe to view solar eclipses through unfiltered telescopes, binoculars, or cameras, as these devices can still magnify the Sun's harmful radiation. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Is it possible to safely watch a solar eclipse with the naked eye?\\" is a resounding no. Adequate eye protection, such as ISO-certified eclipse glasses or solar viewers, must be used to safely observe a solar eclipse without causing permanent damage to your eyes."},{"question":"Answer the following question, with explanation first.

Explanation: A phone book typically contains contact information (addresses and phone numbers) for individuals and businesses. It does not have information on general knowledge, such as the name of the president. Thus, it is not logical to look up the name of the president in a phone book. On the other hand, Sentence A makes sense because one can reasonably expect to find the address for a restaurant in a phone book."},{"question":"Article: Following the news that Rolling Stone will not punish any writers or editors over its debunked campus rape story, the general reaction from fellow journalists has been a mix of bafflement and indignation. CNN’s resident media reporter Brian Stelter shared in that reaction, but also posed an interesting question for perspective: How does NBC News anchor Brian Williams feel about this news? The newsman is currently serving a six-month suspension for a (possibly career-ending) string of public embellishments about his own field reporting. When asked on this morning’s New Day why publisher Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone brass would avoid punishing anyone when so much is on the line, Stelter suggested the move has a lot to do with “loyalty” and “second chances.” “The writer of the article [Sabrina Erdely] is going to be invited back to Rolling Stone to write more in the future,” he noted. “I do wonder how Brian Williams feels reading about this.” Rolling Stone chief Wenner referred to the source of the rape allegations as an “expert fabulist,” essentially shifting the blame off his own writers, editors, and fact-checkers. In NBC’s case, however, Williams was not defended in any such manner — instead being labeled a “fabulist” himself by the media. Also interesting to note: Rolling Stone has fired writers in the past for much lesser offenses than this one. Stelter concluded today’s recap: “It makes all journalists look bad when there’s a terrible journalistic sin like this one. It hurts the whole profession. And it’s kind of baffling we’re not seeing any disciplinary actions taken.” Watch below, via CNN: Please enable Javascript to watch. [h/t Grabien] [Image via CNN/screengrab] — — ||||| LOOK AT YOURSELF The Columbia Journalism School ripped apart the UVa rape story—but the magazine’s chief blames a fabulist, not his own editors who got played. They don’t get it; they just don’t get it. In the Columbia University Journalism School’s 13,000-word postmortem, filled with incriminating details about Rolling Stone’s now-retracted campus rape investigation, the most incriminating detail is that nobody at the magazine seems to believe that its reporting, editorial, and fact-checking practices are in need of serious reform. “Rolling Stone’s senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story’s failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,” reports the highly anticipated, four-month study of how the magazine ended up publishing “A Rape on Campus,” an error-ridden account that focused on a supposedly savage (yet completely unverified) sexual assault at a University of Virginia frat house. The story, originally published Nov. 19, 2014, was recently deleted from the magazine’s website. The blockbuster narrative, by Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely and based largely on the first-person account of a UVa junior and alleged rape victim identified only as “Jackie,” predictably provoked a firestorm of outrage when it was published last fall. Erdely’s story, which suggested an attitude of indifference at best and cover-up at worst by the UVa administration, prompted a different sort of outrage when her reporting—about Jackie’s claims of a gruesome gang rape at Charlottesville’s Phi Kappa Psi House in September 2012—quickly unraveled under scrutiny from The Washington Post, CNN, and other media outlets. The Columbia J-School study, which is 4,000 words longer than Rolling Stone’s retracted piece and presented in a tone of restrained neutrality, uncovered numerous instances of journalistic malpractice in the preparation of Erdely’s story: failure to contact and interview Jackie’s friends (to whom she claimed to have given contemporaneous accounts of the vicious assault); failure to verify the existence of the supposed fraternity member, allegedly a lifeguard at the same swimming pool where Jackie worked, who she claimed took her on a date to a Phi Kappa Psi frat party and witnessed and cheered on the gang rape; failure to provide fraternity officials with the specifics of Jackie’s account when asking for comment; and, worst of all, failure to verify the existence of and seek interviews with the alleged perpetrators of the felony. Yet the Columbia J-School study quotes Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana as stoutly defending the magazine’s procedures: “It’s not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don’t think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we’ve always done and just make sure we don’t make this mistake again.” Coco McPherson, the head of the magazine’s fact-checking department, which also comes under severe criticism in the study, likewise told the authors: “I one hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed. I think decisions were made around those because of the subject matter.” And in a comment that is bound stir up further controversy for a magazine that has had a festering PR problem since the article was published, Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner appeared to absolve his staff and blame Jackie in an interview published Sunday by The New York Times. Wenner “acknowledged the piece’s flaws but said that it represented an isolated and unusual episode and that Ms. Erdely would continue to write for the magazine,” the Times reported. “The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as ‘a really expert fabulist storyteller’ who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, ‘but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.’” Wenner’s attempt to assign responsibility for the bogus story to the alleged victim—rather than the journalists on his payroll—echoed Dana’s initial reaction when the story began to collapse. “In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie’s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,” Dana wrote in an editor’s note—written “very quickly” and “under a lot of pressure,” according to Dana, and posted on Rolling Stone’s website as the journalistic catastrophe unfolded. The J-school study reports: “That language deflected blame from the magazine to its subject and it attracted yet more criticism. Dana said he rued his initial wording. ‘I was pretty freaked out,’ he said. ‘I regretted using that phrase pretty quickly.’ Early that evening, he changed course in a series of tweets. ‘That failure is on us—not on her,’ he wrote. A revised editor’s note, using similar language, appeared the next day.” The study reports that “the most consequential decision Rolling Stone made was to accept that Erdely had not contacted the three friends who spoke with Jackie on the night she said she was raped. That was the reporting path, if taken, that would have almost certainly led the magazine’s editors to change plans.” When they were interviewed by the Post and other outlets, Jackie’s friends contradicted major elements of her account. The study continues: “Erdely said that as she was preparing to write her first draft, she talked with [her editor Sean] Woods about the three friends. ‘Sean advised me that for now we should just put this aside,’ she said. ‘He actually suggested that I change their names for now.’ Woods said that he intended this decision to be temporary, pending further reporting and review.” Erdely “relied solely on Jackie’s information and wrote vividly about how the three friends had reacted after finding Jackie shaken and weeping in the first hours of Sept. 29,” the authors write. Erdely told them: “In retrospect, I wish somebody had pushed me harder” about reaching out to the three for their versions. “I guess maybe I was surprised that nobody said, ‘Why haven’t you called them?’ But nobody did, and I wasn’t going to press that issue.” The study concludes: “Of course, just because an editor does not ask a reporter to check derogatory information with a subject, that does not absolve the reporter of responsibility.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason Remaining a mystery in the J-School study—whose authors enjoyed unfettered access to Rolling Stone’s editors, fact checkers, and reporter along with article drafts, notes, and audio recordings of interviews—is how, why, and whether Rolling Stone’s in-house and outside lawyers approved Erdely’s rape story for publication. The attorneys, whose job is to limit the magazine’s legal exposure by ensuring that stories are solidly reported and factually supported, refused to talk to Coll et al, arguing attorney-client privilege. Editorial staffers likewise refused to discuss the legal advice they were given. The magazine now possibly faces a defamation lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, which has announced that it’s exploring its legal options. The Columbia J-School study concludes that Rolling Stone’s malfeasance amounts to “a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable.” The study continues: “The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine’s editors to reconsider publishing Jackie’s narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine’s reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.” In a statement timed to the study’s release, Erdely offered her “deepest apologies” to her Rolling Stone readers and colleagues, the UVa community, and “any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article.” She added: “Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience.” With Erdely’s position at the magazine seemingly secure, managing editor Dana, fact checking chief McPherson, and Sean Woods, the article’s principal editor, apparently won’t face any disciplinary action, either. Wenner “has decided not to fire anyone on staff,” CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter reported on Sunday night. “He believes the missteps were unintentional, not purposefully deceitful.” ||||| The Rolling Stone story in question. Rolling Stone magazine just plain got it wrong. That's the conclusion of the massive (and massively long) piece penned by three officials at Columbia University journalism school, a report that details the fact that the story of a gang rape of a woman named \\"Jackie\\" at the University of Virginia was, in fact, simply not right. So, that's bad enough. What's worse is that the errors made by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the article's author, and the rest of the Rolling Stone editorial chain were entirely avoidable and encompassed the sort of basic reporting that every student in journalism school should know. Here's the Columbia trio on what happened: Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in \\"A Rape on Campus\\" is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from. Pretty damning stuff, right? Yes. And yet, Rolling Stone has apparently decided that this whole episode was just a blip on the radar and not at all the sort of thing that Erdely, her editor or anyone else should lose their job(s) for. \\"Sabrina’s done great work for us over the years and we expect that to continue,” Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told The Washington Post via e-mail. Um, WHAT? I am not one to call for other reporters' heads when mistakes are made, as I have made mistakes before and had my head called for. But there are mistakes and then there are MISTAKES. A poorly chosen tweet or, in my case, a poorly conceived and unfunny parody, is one thing. Totally misreporting allegations of a gang rape in a hugely high-profile magazine story is another. One is poor judgement, often in the world of Twitter expressed (and regretted) in a millisecond. What Erdely did is journalistic malpractice, failing to do the basic blocking and tackling of reporting because, frankly, the story she had was just too good to check. Credibility and its less-often-mentioned-but-no-less-important cousin accountability are all that any journalist has in this business. The practice of journalism broadly imagined is based on lots and lots of individual reporters' credibility that eventually adds up to a reason why we should be trusted to tell you what you want and, more important, need to know. That's why what Erdely did -- and the stunning lack of accountability from Rolling Stone -- is so problematic for all of us who have dedicated our lives to journalism. Getting the story wrong -- and in such a major way -- obviously erodes our collective credibility. Failing to hold Erdely -- or ANYONE -- accountable for doing their jobs very poorly is even worse. It suggests that not only did journalism swing and miss but we are acting like we are still at the plate and nothing has happened. Is it any wonder that trust in journalism is down there near Congress levels? I've always been an ardent defender of journalism from those who insist that we've blown our chance at once again being the authoritative and objective force in society we once were. My argument has always been that, yes, there are a few bad apples, but most people are trying to do their jobs the best way they know how -- honestly and fairly. I still believe that. But, failures like this one by Erdely and Rolling Stone make it much harder for me to make that case even to myself. Society needs a Fourth Estate that it may not always agree with but that it believes is committed to getting it right and, when it doesn't, taking appropriate action. Rolling Stone did neither of those things with this story. And that's a shame for the rest of us. ||||| With an odd sense of fanfare, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism last night produced a 13,000-word report on Rolling Stone's profoundly flawed account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia, \\"A Rape on Campus,\\" that was published last November. Their conclusion? Rolling Stone fucked up a lot. Missing from Columbia's intense vivisection of the article, however, was a sense of responsibility: Whose fault was this crime against journalism, exactly? According to Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner, no one's, really. No one at the magazine, a baby-boomer favorite, will be dismissed for journalistic malpractice, even though Wenner loves to fire people for seemingly innocuous transgressions. Will Dana and Sean Woods, who edited the story, tried to resign in December, but were refused. Sabrina Rubin Erdely, who wrote the article, will continue to write for the magazine. Wenner, quoted in the New York Times today, is blaming the victim. The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as “a really expert fabulist storyteller” who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, “but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.” This is an incredible statement coming from a magazine publisher with 40-odd years of experience and three titles under his belt (Us Weekly produces some great journalism) who is known for his mercurial temper and preference for workplace fastidiousness (apparently he values clean desks over clean journalism). Sure, there have been instances of publications getting hosed by young, manipulative employees (Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass), but blaming a source because you did not investigate her thoroughly enough is astonishingly idiotic. Here's what happened at Rolling Stone: pathological conflict-avoidance. Every workaround deployed in this story, from not securing the alleged rapist's name before publication to not interviewing the rape victim's friends, was put in place in order to avoid a difficult, uncomfortable situation. Underlying it all is sense of grand interpersonal failures. I'm not going to delve into writing Rolling Stone editorial fanfic, but it's fairly clear that something was awry between the personalities at play here. Whether it was regular workaday pressures—\\"Ahh, who has time to scrap the main gang-rape anecdote before deadline and get another?\\"—or something more insidious, whatever culture that bred this story is poisonous. And for Wenner, a rich, powerful 69-year-old man, to place culpability for his magazine's lapse on a twentysomething pseudonymous woman, well, that tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it? Later in the same Times article, Wenner goes from blaming the article's source to blaming the article's author. A step in the right direction, maybe, but notice here how Wenner paints Erdely as a reckless woman on a mission to bring down the story's editor with her: Ms. Erdely, Mr. Wenner said, “was willing to go too far in her effort to try and protect a victim of apparently a horrible crime. She dropped her journalistic training, scruples and rules and convinced Sean to do the same. There is this series of falling dominoes.” \\"Convinced\\" is an interesting word choice here. Who was in charge of this story? Certainly not Erdely. Was Woods's editorial judgment neutered by her passion for rape victims, as Wenner indicates? Considering Erdely's side of the story, as depicted in Columbia's report, Woods was neither a careful, rigorous, thoughtful nor attentive editor. The domino fall should have stopped with him, but it did not, because of his failings—whether he did not stand up to Erdely, did not push her enough, or was inexperienced with the subject matter. Instead, he chose to work around the problem at hand, defusing a potential conflict with Erdely and severely damaging the credibility of her story. Woods's lack of sensitivity and journalistic finesse is apparent in his boneheaded \\"apology:\\" \\"Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting,\\" Woods said in the Columbia report. \\"We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.\\" Maybe! In another article in the Times today (today is honorary Rolling Stone Fucked Up day in medialand), Jonathan Mahler, a media reporter, hints that gender might have had something to do with the nuclear fallout of the article. So what happened with “A Rape on Campus”? It is hard not to wonder if gender was a contributing factor. The magazine’s publisher and managing editor, and the editor of the article, were all men. Did that make them wary, consciously or not, of pushing back against a female writer’s account of a young woman’s rape? I'll go one step further than Mahler. Yes! Gender definitely had to do with how fucked up this article was. Consider Rolling Stone. A fine magazine, if you're into the Black Crowes, war, and Matt Taibbi. Will Dana and Sean Woods have edited some wonderful dispatches from Baghdad. But as the Columbia report starkly shows, they were clearly entirely out of their wheelhouse when it came to Erdely's report, and instead of, maybe, I don't know, consulting with women, asking women for help, or trying to understand what was at stake, they just barreled on forward like they were still on General McChrystal's plane (it's worth noting that both the head of fact-checking at Rolling Stone and the fact-checker on the story were women, but any higher-level editorial decisions did not fall to them). It brings to mind Grantland's Dr. V disaster—this is what happens when people who think they know everything get too swept up in a story and lose sight of reality. It's very bad. Rolling Stone's claim that it doesn't need to change anything institutionally is hilariously self-defeating. The ultimate fault of \\"A Rape on Campus\\" does not lie with a bad source, a bad journalist or a couple of bad editors. It falls on the empire's leader, Wenner, who should take full responsibility for the article, fire everyone involved, and then fire himself for being a dumb, sexist idiot.

The following sentence is the part where the reviewer talks about their experience with the product: \\"This grip helps me handle the big lenses with ease.\\" The language here is positive and highlights how the grip assists the reviewer in managing larger lenses comfortably. The word \\"ease\\" suggests that not only is the grip effective in helping the reviewer, but it also makes the process significantly more comfortable for them. To summarize, the tone of the product review is positive due to the language used to express satisfaction and the benefits of using the grip. The reviewer described the grip as \\"Great\\" and emphasized how it assisted them in handling their camera with big lenses comfortably, leading to an overall favorable assessment of the product."},{"question":"Karl Fleming joined the military because he needed a change in his life. He had a successful career with a shipping company but he wanted to do something more. He found that something in the U.S. army. Fleming began his service in 2009 and never looked back. A few years later, Fleming volunteered to go to Afghanistan. There, he worked as a bodyguard for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He enjoyed it, except for the almost-nightly rocket attacks. Karl was never hit directly by a rocket, but he didn't need to be to feel its effects. The rockets caused severe shaking, shaking so bad that Fleming was left with many injuries. He was also diagnosed with concussions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Fleming said he was down but not out. Once he returned from Afghanistan, Fleming underwent one test after another. At first, Fleming said he thought he could recover or be able to return to duty and realize his dream of becoming an officer. But then came the news he had never imagined: Fleming would never be an officer because he was too injured to continue. Fleming said he was depressed after learning his military career was over. Add that to the memory loss, extreme anxiety and the many painful medical procedures he was already experiencing. He rarely ventured outside on the weekend. Instead, he preferred to sleep in. All that changed, however, with Fleming's service dog, Kuchar. Fleming said he had heard dogs could help people suffering from PTSD, so he started doing research. Karl eventually selected K9s for Warriors, which is where he met Kuchar, a yellow lab. Fleming and Kuchar trained together for weeks, before returning to Fort Benning. K9s for Warriors provided Fleming with Kuchar and the training for free. Life with Kuchar has been life-changing. Fleming doesn't sleep in any more because Kuchar won't let him. Instead, they venture out into a world Karl was once afraid of -- a world for Fleming that now seems impossible to imagine without Kuchar by his side. Karl Fleming joined the army because _ .

(AP) — The parents of a New Jersey boy who was 4 when he fatally shot a 6-year-old neighbor have been ordered to pay nearly 600,000 to the slain youth's family. Anthony and Melissa Senatore will also have to pay punitive damages to Brandon Holt's parents under the ruling issued Monday. But that amount hasn't been determined. Anthony Senatore has admitted keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unlocked in his bedroom, where his son found it in April 2013. The boy took it outside and shot Brandon Holt once in the head. Senatore received a three-year prison term last year after he pleaded guilty to child endangerment. The rulings came in a wrongful death suit brought by Holt's family. The Senatores were ordered to pay 572,588. ||||| TOMS RIVER -- A Superior Court judge ordered the parents of a preschooler who shot his 6-year-old neighbor to death with a loaded rifle they kept under their bed to pay more than 570,000 to the dead boy's parents. The 572,588.26 award Monday to Christine and Ronald Holt was Judge Robert Brenner's finding in the wrongful death suit the former Toms River couple brought against Anthony and Melissa Senatore in 2013 shooting death of their son Brandon Holt. Anthony Senatore has not disputed leaving his loaded rifle under his bed before the April 8, 2013, shooting so Brenner was left to determine how much Senatore and his wife should have to pay the Holts for the services and companionship Brandon would have provided his parents in the future, for his pain and suffering before his death and for the family's unpaid medical and funeral expenses. Brenner found Anthony Senatore 90 percent responsible for Brandon's death and Melissa Senatore 10 percent negligent because, he said, she should have known the weapon was under the bed. Photographs of the dark wood floor under the Senatores' bed showed it was not dusty and appeared to have been cleaned at some point. Melissa Senatore was not in court and has not responded to the lawsuit, but Brenner said she still would be held responsible for her share of the judgment. Anthony Senatore pleaded guilty to child endangerment in October 2014 and was sentenced in February 2015 to three years in prison. Under New Jersey's sentencing guidelines, he served nine months of that term before being released on parole. Brandon, who lived two houses away from the Senatores on McCormick Drive in Toms River, was playing \\"pretend shooting\\" with the Senatores' 4-year-old son on April 8, 2013, when the younger boy grabbed his father's gun and shot his friend in the head outside the Senatores' rented house. Brandon died the following day at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. The trial, which lasted slightly less than two hours, included tearful testimony from Christine Holt, who described finding her son struggling to breathe after one of the Senatore told her Brandon was hurt. She said she didn't know he had been shot until she arrived at the hospital. She described how she tried to comfort him as he lay on the seat of the Senatores' golf cart. His eyes were open, he was bleeding from his mouth and he was gasping for air, she said. \\"I was rubbing his legs, telling him to breathe,\\" she said. \\"I kept telling him I loved him.\\" Father of boy, 4, who shot and killed 6-year-old friend sentenced to prison Anthony Senatore testified he told Ronald Holt that the boy was shot with his rifle, but Ronald Holt adamantly denied Senatore said anything about the weapon. \\"I asked him what happened and he said his eye got grazed by a pellet gun,\\" Holt said. \\"Isn't it true he told you your son was shot with a .22 (caliber) rifle,\\" Senatore's attorney, Robert Ebberup asked him on cross-examination. \\"No,\\" Holt shot back. Ebberup asked if it was possible Holt could have missed that comment in all the commotion. \\"What I heard? What he told me? I know what he said,\\" Holt replied. Brenner still has to rule on punitive damages against the Senatores but he said it would be based on their ability to pay. He gave the attorneys 30 days to determine the Senatores' financial assets. Since the shooting, the Senatores have moved to Pine Beach and the Holts have moved to the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township. They have an 18-month-old son and Christine Holt started a charitable organization called \\"Brandon's Elves\\" to provide children in Ocean County's social services programs with Christmas gifts. The trial was much shorter than the average wrongful death case because Senatore did not dispute his responsibility in Brandon's death and because the Senatores, as renters, had no homeowners insurance that would have involved another party.

(CBSNewYork) — It was a tragedy beyond comprehension that shattered the lives of two families in Toms River, New Jersey. Six-year-old Brandon Holt was shot by his 4-year-old playmate with a gun that had been left unsecured, CBS2’s Christine Sloane reported. For the first time, the public heard from Brandon’s parents who testified Monday in the civil trial of the gun owner. The mother and father relived the painful moment of running up to their neighbor’s home to find their 6-year-old son accidentally shot in the head by another child. He was still conscious in a gold cart, but later died in the hospital. “He was laying on the bench like the seat laying down… he was bleeding,” mother Christine Holt said. “I was just rubbing his legs telling him I was there, telling him to breath ’cause he was trying to breath… I just kept telling him I loved him.” Ronald Hold, the victim’s father, said he “could see [his] son’s eye really swollen and trying to catch his breath.” Defendant Anthony Senatore confirmed that the gun in his son’s hand was his while testifying in the wrongful death suit against him. Senatore said he forgot he had placed the .22-caliber rifle under his bed. He’s already served nine months in the criminal case. “When the gun went off I turned around, realized what gun it had been so I immediately removed it from his hands,” he said. “My daughter had came around the side of my house and said, “Dad, Brandon was shot.'” The judge is awarding the couple 572,588 dollars, but they say it wasn’t about the money. “I just want everyone to now just lock up your guns. That’s what it was about today– just lock up your guns,” Christine Holt said. The Holts told CBS2 they now have an 18-month-old child. Senatore’s attorney said the owner of the gun is suffering too. The couple was awarded compensatory damages on Monday, but everyone is due back in court in a month for the judge’s punitive damages decision. ||||| Summary:","response":"In April 2013, after finding a loaded .22-caliber rifle under his parent's bed, a four year old boy in New Jersey shot and killed Brandon Holt, his six-year-old neighbor.

At a time when almost everything Mrs. Clinton publicly says feeds presidential speculation, she has also used the speeches to address issues like the Arab Spring, the conflict in Syria and the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Mrs. Clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. A spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment. But her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest. (So far, Mrs. Clinton’s staff appears to have carefully chosen where she has given speeches, avoiding paid talks to potentially controversial groups.) “We’re starting immediately to monitor both Hillary and the other Democratic rising stars and collect, tag and characterize their speeches so we can hold them accountable when the campaign begins in earnest,” said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a conservative political action committee. Mr. Miller said that it was too early to send operatives to covertly buy tickets to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches, but that the group was watching from a distance “to monitor whether she’s hobnobbing with investment bankers in New York City that might seem like favoritism down the line.” Since Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, she has divided her time between writing a memoir and juggling a growing schedule of engagements, paid and unpaid. The unpaid appearances are typically focused on her advocacy work for women and girls as part of the Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization founded by her husband. (She is not completely avoiding politics, and will campaign for Terry McAuliffe, a family friend who is running for governor of Virginia.) ||||| Hillary Clinton is leading both Chris Christie and Rand Paul in a potential 2016 presidential race, a new poll finds. Clinton holds a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over the New Jersey governor, according to the Quinnipiac poll out Friday.

(PHOTOS: 2016: Who’s next?) Vice President Joe Biden, another Democrat rumored to be in the mix for 2016, didn’t fare as well. Biden was trailing Christie 35 percent to 46 percent and was in a dead heat with Paul at 42 percent. Part of the explanation may be in the favorability numbers: 55 percent of those surveyed said they viewed Clinton favorably, compared with 38 percent who viewed her unfavorably. Biden, however, was underwater, with 44 percent viewing him unfavorably and 38 percent viewing him favorably. (PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary 2016?)

(Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews) Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped down as secretary of state earlier this year, but there has been no shortage of Clinton on the national stage in the past two decades. (Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews) Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to Chicago last month to give a major speech in a cavernous convention hall. Her audience was 15,000 human resources professionals, and her remarks were tailored specifically to how immigration reform and President Obama’s health-care overhaul might affect their industry. In the six months since stepping down as secretary of state, Clinton has addressed apartment-complex developers in Dallas, private-equity managers in Los Angeles and business executives in Grand Rapids, Mich. Still to come are travel agents, real estate brokers, clinical pathologists and car dealers — collecting more than 200,000 per appearance, according to one executive who arranges speaking tours. This is how Clinton is cashing in on her star power as she weighs whether to run for the White House. The would-be Democratic front-runner is barnstorming the country, delivering speeches and answering questions at events sponsored by industry groups eager to gain access to someone who may be the next president. Clinton is the only leading 2016 contender giving paid speeches, with at least 14 delivered or scheduled so far, in part because ethics rules prohibit sitting lawmakers from doing so. Past presidential contenders, such as Republicans Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty, gave relatively few such addresses, and for much lower five-figure fees. A hectic speaking schedule is more common for those who have left electoral politics for good, including her husband, former president Bill Clinton — who has racked up tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees since leaving office — and other former secretaries of state, such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. 1 of 51 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hillary Rodham Clinton: A political life View Photos Looking back at the career of the secretary of state and former senator and first lady.

Most of the trade groups Clinton has addressed actively lobby Congress on issues both substantial and mundane. The American Society of Travel Agents, which Clinton will address in September, wants airlines to provide data to travel agencies about baggage and boarding fees. The National Multi Housing Council, which Clinton addressed in April, advocates, among other things, low-interest loans for those who deal with bedbug infestations. When she spoke to the Society for Human Resource Management in June, association chief executive Hank Jackson said, “We were very pleased that most of her speech was tailored towards HR issues.” “She didn’t realize how intimately involved we are in providing feedback to Congress on how immigration from a practical perspective — not from a political perspective — is affecting businesses’ ability to manage talent,” Jackson said. “Giving her that insight was something that she could take away from the meeting.” Other audiences have many millions of dollars at stake in federal tax policies. In June, Clinton addressed an investor meeting in Los Angeles of KKR, the private-equity giant, and fielded questions from firm co-founder Henry Kravis. Her appearance, first reported by Politico, was confirmed by a KKR spokeswoman. Clinton’s spokesman declined to talk publicly about her speaking schedule. One person familiar with Clinton’s private speeches said she is not being lobbied at the appearances. “She’s talking about her experiences at State, and people have questions that are as you’d expect, but no one’s getting up and lobbying her,” said the person, who discussed the events on the condition of anonymity. Ron Kaufman, a Republican lobbyist and top adviser to former president George H.W. Bush, said such events allow groups to promote their agendas. “Whether they’re listened to is a different ballgame,” he said. “I think she’s not the kind of person who will be influenced by it, but they can establish pre-communications.” Clinton’s office does not publicly release her schedule, and most of her paid engagements are closed to the news media. The paid appearances are arranged through the Harry Walker Agency, which also represents her husband. The agency does not reveal her speaking fee. But one top executive at a rival speakers bureau, who requested anonymity to share internal industry details, said it is more than 200,000. Former president George W. Bush, by contrast, commands 100,000 to 150,000 per speech, as do former Bush administration officials such as Rice and Powell, the executive said. Only Clinton’s husband is on a par with her in speaking fees among political figures, the executive said. Many organizations that hire Clinton to speak heavily promote the booking, using her name and portrait to gin up registrations and sales for their conventions. “These speeches are what an ex-secretary of state, ex-senator, ex-first lady, someone who’s an international star, ought to be making,” said Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family loyalist. “I don’t see anything unusual about it.” Not much time off When Clinton left office after traveling to 112 countries in four years, she described herself as exhausted and said she was looking forward to catching up with family and friends, watching home design shows (her favorite is HGTV’s “Love It or List It”), and writing her next book. She also had a blood-clot scare in January that landed her in the hospital for several days. “I just want to sleep and exercise and travel for fun,” she said in a New York Times interview late last year. “And relax. It sounds so ordinary, but I haven’t done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired.” But Clinton, 65, has not taken much time off since. In addition to her paid appearances, she has given more than a dozen pro bono speeches — in some cases to accept awards, such as the American Bar Association’s ABA Medal, which she will receive in San Francisco next month. “I am pleased to see that she is not slowing down as Citizen Clinton,” former congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Calif.) said in introducing Clinton at a Bryn Mawr College event Tuesday. This fall, Clinton’s schedule picks up considerably. In November, Clinton will bounce from Orlando (the Learning 2013 education conference) to San Francisco (the National Association of Realtors) and back to Orlando (Press Ganey Associates, a health-care firm). Her 2014 calendar is starting to fill up, too, with a January booking before the National Automobile Dealers Association. Both Democratic and Republican operatives said the strategy is smart for Clinton, so long as she avoids controversial groups and focuses on nonpolitical and often business-friendly audiences. Clinton has addressed events aimed at both Democrats and Republicans, according to event organizers. When she was the keynote speaker a June gala for the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, one of the evening’s honorees was Amway President Doug DeVos, a prominent Republican whose family has given tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes. In May, Clinton was introduced by former Nixon secretary of state Henry Kissinger at an Atlantic Council black-tie gala in Washington. Council President Frederick Kempe said Kissinger “brought down the house when he alluded to her future presidential possibilities.” Former congresswoman Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Calif.), a Clinton friend and Atlantic Council leader, said: “It was a huge, blowout event. . . . There were so many people inside the Ritz-Carlton that you couldn’t move.” Clinton’s speaking schedule illustrates her deep network of contacts across industries. She agreed to give a paid speech to the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago this September in part, organizers said, because of the group’s work with the Clinton Global Initiative, her family’s charitable organization. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), a former aide to her husband, will introduce Clinton, and E. Blair Holladay, the group’s executive vice president, will ask her questions from the stage. Holladay said Clinton’s fee, which he would not disclose, will be covered by event sponsors, including some pharmaceutical companies. Holladay noted that when Bill Clinton addressed the group’s convention in 2011, he requested a spread of vegan food backstage. “I haven’t gotten any specific requests from Hillary,” he said. Presidential assumptions One of the first groups to book Clinton was the relatively low-profile Pacific Council on International Policy, which awarded her its inaugural Warren Christopher Public Service Award. The council’s co-chairman is Kantor, who served along with Christopher in Bill Clinton’s Cabinet. “I called her and there was not much hesitation whatsoever in accepting,” Kantor said, adding that she “took no fee at all.” The former first lady’s staff picked the date, May 8, and gave organizers about six weeks to plan the gala at the luxurious Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. “We sold out relatively early,” Pacific Council President Jerrold D. Green said. “What we all assume is that she is running for president.” Many of Clinton’s audiences assume the same. In April, when Clinton appeared in front of the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group of apartment complex developers, she did not deliver a speech. Instead, organizers asked her to pose for pictures with the group’s executive council and answer questions on stage from the group’s chairman, Thomas S. Bozzuto, a Maryland developer. “Naturally,” Bozzuto said, “she ducked my question when I asked her if she was going to run for president.” ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"Sure, let me break it down for you. This story is about a woman named Mrs. Clinton. You might also know her as Hillary Clinton. She used to be the Secretary of State, which means she did a lot of important work helping to look after our country, especially in dealing with other countries around the world. Now, she's not doing that job anymore, but she's still really busy. Mrs. Clinton travels all around the country giving speeches to different groups of people. These people are usually doing special jobs like managing companies or developing houses. They all love to hear her talk because she's very smart and has lots of experience. Some people think she gets paid a lot of money for these speeches. At the same time, there are people keeping an eye on where Mrs. Clinton is going and what she's saying. They're interested because they think she might want to be the President of our country in the future. This is a really big job and a lot of people want to know if she's planning to do it. There are also polls, which are like little quizzes where lots of people tell you what they think about something. These polls say that many people like Mrs. Clinton and would like her to be our president. But there are other people that might also want to be president, like Mr. Christie, Mr. Paul, and Mr. Biden. The polls are trying to figure out who people might choose. For the most part, Mrs. Clinton spends her time delivering speeches, writing a book about her experiences, and helping out at the organization that her husband started, which is called the Clinton Foundation.
