Options: - practice - skill - thief - dexterity - knowledge of music The answer is \\"dexterity\\" because","response":"fiddling with something generally refers to the physical manipulation or handling of an object or device, which requires a level of finesse, control, and coordination. Dexterity is the suitable answer for this question, as it represents the precise coordination and control over one's body movements, especially in the hands and fingers. Although other options like practice, skill, thief, and knowledge of music bear some relevance to different capacities, they don't necessarily apply in this context. Option 1 - Practice: While practice might develop or improve the skills required to fiddle with something, it is not an inherent skill itself. Practice is the process of refining and honing a skill, but possessing a level of dexterity is essential. Option 2 - Skill: Skill is a broad term that entails the ability to perform an action or accomplish a task, but it does not accurately represent the physical ability required to fiddle with something. Dexterity, on the other hand, is specific to the coordination and precision needed for such tasks. Option 3 - Thief: Thieves might have the ability to fiddle with objects, particularly when picking locks or engaging in other acts of theft. However, the term 'thief' is not a skill or ability, but rather, a label for someone who engages in stealing. Hence, it is not an appropriate answer to the question. Option 4 - Knowledge of Music: While the term \\"fiddling\\" can be associated with playing the fiddle or a violin, this answer doesn't necessarily address the broader context of fiddling with objects or devices. Moreover, possessing knowledge of music doesn't directly imply the physical ability to manipulate objects skillfully. In conclusion, dexterity is the most appropriate answer to the question because it accurately captures the physical ability to handle or manipulate objects with precision and control. It is a skill that can be honed and refined through practice, and it is widely useful, not just limited to certain professions or hobbies."},{"question":"Write a \\"positive\\" movie review (Available choices: * negative; * positive;).","response":"Title: The Enchantment of Life In a world where movie-goers are often overwhelmed by an overflow of mind-numbing action and clichéd stories, the film \\"The Enchantment of Life\\" soars like a breath of fresh air.

REUTERS/Maxim The battle for east Ukraine is getting nastier by the day. Pro-Russian rebels, believed to be reinforced by Russian troops, are successfully pushing back against the Ukrainian army in an attempt to take over strategic transport and energy hubs, like Debaltseve and Mariupol, for the sake of making their self-proclaimed state more sustainable. Hundreds of thousands of civilians along the eastern Ukraine frontline have been affected by the brutal fighting. The death toll is rising rapidly: over 5,000 people have died in Ukraine since the fighting started in Spring 2014. Ukraine says 9,000 Russian troops are inside the country, 50,000 more are on the border and ready to enter anytime. Russia denies any military presence, although it does not rule out the possibility that Russian volunteer fighters may be operating inside the country. Numerous reports from foreign, Ukrainian and even Russian journalists dispute the Kremlin’s assertions. They say that Russian military units are indeed fighting in east Ukraine. Faced with this situation, Ukrainian government officials and the public at large are enthusiastic about the news that the U.S. is considering arming the country. Scared for its future, post-revolutionary Ukraine wants a stable flow of Western military support, including lethal weapons. Many in Ukraine believe this is only this way to save the country from total occupation by Russia. But let’s get real. Nuclear Russia spends 50 times more on its army annually than Ukraine does, and it has about four times more soldiers and six times as many military aircraft. It could take over Ukraine in a matter of days. Kiev is just 120 miles from the Russian border. And although nobody knows for sure what’s inside Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mind, the occupation of Ukraine is not on the table, at least not yet. Instead, it looks like a covert invasion of east Ukraine suits Russia much more: it keeps Ukraine on the verge of collapsing, robbing the country and its potential investors of any sense of stability, without using the military might required for a full invasion. Arming Ukraine will not fix the country’s huge military imbalance with Russia. Unless, of course, Western allies are ready to shell out 70 billion per year. That’s what it would take to match Russia’s military. Finding that kind of cash is unlikely. Ukraine is having a hard time getting the estimated 15 billion it needs to avoid default this year. Importantly, a war-fatigued United States, which is preparing for presidential elections in 2016, would scarcely seem to be open to military involvement in yet another country. At the same time, solving the problem is a lot more complex that simply providing Ukraine with weapons. The country is ravaged by corruption, and its political system and economy is in shambles. Any military support would have to be conditional upon effective reforms. Without that, arming Ukraine would be irresponsible — it would be no different to giving a gun to a crook. The Ukrainian army, too, is widely considered to be plagued by corruption and incompetence. It is also reportedly infiltrated by Russian intelligence. This might be why, despite a strong patriotic rally for the push against Russia, there have been reports of rising numbers of Ukrainians avoiding the draft. Ukraine’s leaders have acknowledged the problem and have pledged to clean up the nation’s military. We can give the Ukrainian government credit for that. Still, after almost 25 years of a near kleptocracy, this could take years. War isn’t helping. So far, there are no indications that there is any timetable for a potential U.S. arms drop to Ukraine, let alone that the United States in indeed serious about doing so. The State Department could just be testing the waters or trying to scare Russia off from advancing further. If that’s the case, it’s unlikely that will work either. Have you checked the Russian media lately? The most popular story making the rounds right now (and also the most hilarious example of Russian propaganda) is about Putin being “able to finish NATO with just one phone-call.” Indeed, harsher rhetoric will only help Putin in rallying more domestic support for his agenda, as it will strengthen his claim that the West is interfering in Ukraine. The Russian leader will undoubtedly use military threats from the West to support his position that NATO countries are aggressors, trying to suffocate Russia by expanding militarily on its border. There are only two ways to stop Russia’s attempt to control Ukraine by stealth. Strengthen Ukraine by pressuring the government to introduce much-needed reforms. Effective anti-corruption measures need to be introduced now that will make obsolete the remnants of Ukraine’s kleptocracy. General distrust and frustration with crooks on every level of the Ukrainian bureaucracy was one of the main sources of secessionist sentiments in eastern Ukrainian provinces. Russia has exploited this all too well. At the same time, the West should continue bringing pressure to bear on Russia through its economic sanctions — if it wants to get tougher on Russia, it can always ramp these up. There are plenty of sensible, and effective, measures the West could support to help the situation. Providing more guns and ammunition in this volatile part of the world is not one of them.","response":"Title: \\"Arming Ukraine: A Challenging Path Towards Stability Amidst an Unrelenting Crisis\\" The escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine has raised questions about the efficacy of providing military support to Ukraine. The pro-Russian rebels, with alleged backing from Russian troops, continue to push back against the Ukrainian army. The death toll from the struggle has exceeded 5,000 and the crisis is adversely affecting hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Ukraine. Despite the bleak conditions, Ukrainians have expressed support for the idea that the U.S. is considering arming their country. Many are convinced that Western military aid, including lethal weapons, is imperative to protect Ukraine from being completely occupied by Russia. However, it must be considered that arming Ukraine will not alleviate its immense military imbalance with Russia. With Russia spending 50 times more annually on its military, it is highly unlikely that the West can rectify this disproportionate capability. Moreover, Ukraine's political and economic predicaments call for more intricate solutions than simply supplying weapons. Any assistance in the form of military resources would have to be contingent upon effective political and economic reforms in Ukraine to enable responsible actions. In its current state, arming Ukraine could potentially have harmful consequences. Furthermore, the Ukrainian army is beleaguered by issues such as corruption, incompetence, and infiltration by Russian intelligence. This raises concerns about effectively weaponizing Ukraine in its ongoing struggle against the pro-Russian rebels. It is crucial to recognize the need for considerable change and reform within the nation's military itself. The process of transforming the Ukrainian military may take years to achieve, with the ongoing conflict further complicating matters. It is currently unclear when or if the U.S. is genuinely committed to supplying arms to Ukraine. The State Department's discussion of this possibility might be a strategy to deter Russia from intensifying the conflict. However, this tactic is unlikely to be successful, as it could merely strengthen Putin's domestic support and feed into the narrative of encroachment by Western powers. A more constructive approach to addressing the crisis involves bolstering Ukraine by pressuring its government to enact much-needed reforms, particularly in anti-corruption measures. Additionally, the West should maintain economic sanctions against Russia and potentially strengthen them as needed. Finding the most appropriate course of action is crucial, as supplying more weapons may not be the most effective solution to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine."},{"question":"News article: Giggle like Chris Pratt at delightful 'Guardians of the Galaxy' bloopers By Andrea Romano2014-12-12 22:44:15 UTC Even CGI superheroes mess up sometimes.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.

For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, let's analyze each sentence step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1 suggests that there is a belief or opinion that having another war is needed or beneficial. Sentence 2 implies that engaging in another war would cause significant harm or negative consequences. Step 2: Consider the relationship between the sentences. The two sentences express opposing viewpoints regarding the potential impact of another war. Step 3: Determine the conditions under which the first sentence is true. For sentence 1 to be true, there must exist reasons or scenarios in which another war is perceived as necessary or beneficial, such as achieving a certain political goal or addressing an ongoing conflict. Step 4: Examine if the second sentence could be true under the same conditions. Even if there are reasons for which another war is deemed necessary or beneficial, it is also possible that engaging in that war could cause considerable harm or negative consequences (as stated in sentence 2). This could include loss of life, economic disruption, or long-term societal ramifications. Conclusion: If the first sentence (\\"We could use another war\\") is true based on the reasons or scenarios that justify engaging in another war, it is still possible for the second sentence (\\"Another war would hurt us greatly\\") to be true, as the negative impacts of war can coexist with the perceived necessity or benefits. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence can also be true."},{"question":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: A sentimental coming of age movie.

Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle.

The sleeper hit about a high school football team in the fictional small town of Dillon, Texas is still a treasured television artifact: it gave us timeless mantras like “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose” and the classic “Texas forever.” (Not to mention inspiring women everywhere with Connie Britton’s infinite wisdom and aspirational hair.) Unfortunately, though, we won’t get to see the show make a comeback. The cast reunited over the weekend — but not to film a reboot. Some cast members, including Britton, attended a reunion at the ATX Television Festival, while others, including Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch, attended a separate gathering in Illinois to race in the Chicago Spartan Super. Although actress Minka Kelly told Vanity Fair that they’re “like a little family,” it doesn’t sound like fans should get their hopes up for a sequel to the beloved show, which aired for five seasons before ending its run in 2011. “I’ll never play Riggins again,” said Taylor Kitsch, known for his role as the hunky, brooding football star. Kelly, who played peppy cheerleader Lyla Garrity, agreed: “I think some things are better left [with people] wanting more.” The actors also mused on where their characters would be now: Kitsch thinks Riggins would be hanging out on his land with a family, while Kelly said Garrity would probably have settled in Nashville. And despite the steamy romance the two shared on the show, both actors believe Riggins would have ended up with his other love interest, Adrianne Palicki’s Tyra Collette. (Kelly, for her part, waffled on that prediction.) Some things in Texas are forever, though: the Austin-based reunion included a throwback tailgate and pep rally held right on the Panthers’ field where the show was originally filmed. Check out some snaps of the cast below. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly said that Kelly and Kitsch were at the ATX Television Festival in Atlanta. They were at a separate event in Chicago.","response":"The cast of the popular drama series \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" which originally premiered a decade ago, recently reunited at the ATX Television Festival, putting to rest any hopes for a reboot of the show.

Companies are now tapping into a diverse talent pool, establishing strong connections across multiple countries, and dealing with an ever-widening array of cultural norms, values, and traditions. This growth in cultural diversity has led to both challenges and opportunities for businesses. One challenge that organizations face in incorporating diverse cultures is effective communication. Employees from different cultural backgrounds may hold different perspectives on values, motivations, and decision-making, which could hinder collaboration and progress on various projects. On the other hand, cultural diversity can also offer many benefits, such as increased creativity and innovation, an improved understanding of different markets, and better problem-solving abilities. A business's ability to leverage cultural diversity effectively can be a significant competitive advantage. Hypothesis: The hypothesis proposed is that organizations that adopt strategies to actively encourage cultural diversity in the workplace will experience an increase in overall business performance and competitiveness. These strategies may include cultural sensitivity training for employees, promoting an inclusive work environment, open-mindedness in terms of perspectives, providing support for language and communication barriers, and valuing individuals for their unique skills.

In the interim came The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \\"Dear Prudence\\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\".

The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Alan Prince, in collaboration with Paul Smolensky, helped extend phonology by developing the Optimality Theory (OT) during a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991. Optimality Theory is a significant advancement in the field of phonology, providing a unified framework for the understanding of how languages determine the pronunciation of words based on the hierarchical ranking of a set of constraints. This innovative approach shifted the focus from rule-based phonological systems to constraint-based systems, proving to be a dominant trend in phonology and later being extended to morphology. In Optimality Theory, languages select the most optimal pronunciation of a word based on the best satisfaction of a list of ranked constraints. These constraints are ordered by importance, and a lower-ranked constraint can be violated if it is necessary to satisfy a higher-ranked one. This system enables a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of linguistic patterns, as well as accounting for the variability and language-specific differences in phonological processes. John McCarthy and Alan Prince extended the Optimality Theory to morphology, exploring the ways in which this framework could be applied to morphological processes, such as affixation and word formation. The expansion of Optimality Theory to morphology further enriched the understanding of how the intricate relations between phonology and morphology could be better represented within a constraint-based approach. The development of Optimality Theory and its application to phonology and morphology contributed to the increasing interest in the phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements within various approaches. Elements such as phonetic features were analyzed in terms of their ability to be motivated by articulatory or perceptual considerations. However, this emphasis on phonetic grounding has drawn criticism from proponents of 'substance-free phonology,' such as Mark Hale and Charles Reiss. They argue against the reliance on phonetic substance in theoretical constructs and propose that phonological knowledge should be based solely on the abstract combinatorial properties of elements within a system. In summary, Alan Prince, along with Paul Smolensky, John McCarthy, and others, helped extend phonology by developing Optimality Theory, a groundbreaking constraint-based approach that has profoundly influenced the study of phonology and morphology. This framework has spurred debates on the phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements, leading to nuanced discussions and developments in the field of linguistics."},{"question":"Instructions: Two analogies that relate items to whether they are trash or treasure is given in the form \\"A : B.

Step 2: Compare the key information in the premise with the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the woman is watching a bonfire. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to see if the information in the hypothesis can be inferred from the information in the premise. - In the premise, we know that the woman is facing a bright fire, which implies that she is looking at the fire. - The hypothesis states that the woman is watching a bonfire. The term \\"bonfire\\" would typically imply a large, outdoor fire. Step 4: Evaluate if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise. The premise tells us that the woman is facing a bright fire, but it does not provide information about the size or location of the fire.

ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN. The songs aren't as good, nor is the chemistry between the characters. But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top, and then running down the steps, while dozens of pianists play on the piano, is the best scene in the film, even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing. Sinatra then croons, \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\\" before having his epiphany about whom he loves.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct.

The group was fronted by Holly Johnson (vocals), with Paul Rutherford (vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar), and Brian Nash (guitar). The group's 1983 debut single \\"Relax\\" was banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number six in the charts and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks, going on to enjoy prolonged chart success throughout that year and ultimately becoming the seventh best-selling UK single of all time. It also won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single. On the B-side to the group's first single, Johnson explained that the group's name derived from a page from The New Yorker magazine, featuring the headline \\"Frankie Goes Hollywood\\" and a picture of Frank Sinatra, although the magazine page Johnson referred to was actually a pop art poster by Guy Peellaert. The original group named \\"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\" dates from 1980. The nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool punk scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with Big in Japan and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), Jed O'Toole (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves the Sons of Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding. The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \\"Ped\\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \\"The Warehouse\\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford - a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys - apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \\"The Leatherpets\\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \\"Krisco Kisses\\", \\"Two Tribes\\", \\"Disneyland\\", and \\"The World Is My Oyster\\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash. In February 1983, the group was invited to record a video for \\"Relax\\" by the Channel 4 show The Tube at the Liverpool State Ballroom. After the broadcast, the Peel session was repeated on radio, and a new session recorded for the BBC, comprising \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\\", \\"The Only Star in Heaven\\" and \\"Relax\\". These performances, along with a repeat of the Tube video, convinced Trevor Horn to sign the group for his new label, ZTT Records, in May 1983.

Sentence 2: The case presented was entirely circumstantial. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true based on the information provided in the sentences. Allow me to provide a detailed analysis of the relationships between these two sentences. Sentence 1: \\"Not only was it entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically unproved.\\" This sentence states two things: 1. The case was \\"entirely circumstantial,\\" meaning that the evidence provided in this case relies solely on indirect evidence and not on direct observation or testimony. 2. The \\"greater part\\" of the circumstantial evidence was \\"practically unproved,\\" implying that much of this indirect evidence was not effectively substantiated or supported in the case. Sentence 2: \\"The case presented was entirely circumstantial.\\" This sentence also asserts that the case was entirely circumstantial in nature. It refers to the same situation as described in Sentence 1, emphasizing that the case relies solely on indirect evidence without providing any direct observation or testimony. Now, let's look at the relationship between these two sentences. The information provided in Sentence 1 directly supports the statement made in Sentence 2. If we take Sentence 1 as true, we already know that the case is entirely circumstantial. This directly correlates with the statement made in Sentence 2, asserting that the case presented is entirely circumstantial. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true, as they both essentially convey the same idea about the case being entirely circumstantial in nature. The first sentence provides additional information about the \\"greater part\\" of the evidence being \\"practically unproved,\\" but this detail does not challenge or contradict the information given in the second sentence. Instead, it further emphasizes the circumstantial nature of the case, reinforcing the statement in Sentence 2."},{"question":"- Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom What might be the last step of the process?

My big complaint is the tacos and quesadilla were extremely dry. They have two salsas - an orange and yellow colored salsa. The salsa tasted good on the chips, but not good enough or complimentary for the entree. The girl who took everyone's order was very nice so customer service was good. Lastly, the restaurant only seats 12-14 people (elbow to elbow) so eat out if you wish. Ultimately I would not eat here again, but if you read other reviews and decide I'm off my rocker, take it to go and buy an extra bottle of water because your mouth will be dry after eating. Is this review positive or negative? Available options: A). negative. B). positive. Answer:","response":"A). negative. Explanation: The review states that the food was extremely dry, the salsas did not complement the entree well, and the seating was very limited. Although there were a few positive aspects (customer service and somewhat authentic tacos), the overall tone of the review is negative, and the author even says that they \\"would not eat here again.\\""},{"question":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"A monster truck in the air above demolished cars.\\" can we conclude that \\"A monster truck is demolishing cars in the world championship.\\"?

Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.

Is The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician. a good answer to this question? Choose from: (I). yes. (II). no.","response":"(II). no. A more detailed and long answer would involve specifying the type of fossils and the dating method used, as well as a brief explanation of the process. Here is a suggested response: The oxygen that was used to date the Hirnantian faunal stage does not come from a specific fossil but rather from the isotopes found within particular types of fossils. Oxygen isotopes, specifically oxygen-18, were used to date the stage by examining their distribution within conodont microfossils. Conodonts are small, tooth-shaped fossils of the jawless marine animals considered to be a proxy indicator of past climate conditions. The process of dating the Hirnantian faunal stage, which marked the onset of an ice age towards the end of the Ordovician period, involved the oxygen isotope stratigraphy method. This method relies upon the ratio of the isotopes oxygen-18 (18O) and oxygen-16 (16O) within specific fossils or sediment samples. The ratio fluctuates in response to changes in temperature and the volume of continental ice, providing a valuable record of past climatic conditions. As the climate gets colder, water molecules containing the heavier isotope, oxygen-18, preferentially precipitate, causing water containing the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, to be concentrated in the remaining seawater. When a creature like a conodont incorporates oxygen into its hard parts, it does so with the oxygen-18 isotope because it is more readily available in volcanic ash and clay minerals than the oxygen-16 counterpart. These isotopic variations are then preserved in the conodont microfossils, providing a record of the ancient ocean's oxygen isotopic composition. Through the Hirnantian faunal stage, researchers discovered an increase in oxygen-18 in conodont apatite, which indicates reduced seawater temperatures and the onset of an ice age. As a result, the oxygen isotopic records extracted from the conodont microfossils were crucial in dating the stage and confirming the hypothesis that the Hirnantian faunal stage was marked by dramatic climatic shifts, ultimately ending the stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician period."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on edward lockyer 's: - profession - death place - successor - party - riding - predecessor - death date - spouse - term end - term start - birth date - name - birth place - religion Bio: edward russell lockyer -lrb- 25 december 1899 - 5 october 1958 -rrb- was a progressive conservative party member of the canadian house of commons . he was born in rural manitoulin island , ontario . in 1918 , he moved to toronto and entered the clothing business , but switched industries by 1929 , creating a fuel company . he eventually became president of northern fuel and automatic heating ltd. . he also joined the bedford masonic lodge . lockyer was elected at the trinity riding in the march 1958 general election and served for several months in the 24th canadian parliament when died in toronto on october 1958 . he was stricken with heart disease while viewing a telecast of the fourth game of the 1958 world series .

Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, Mario made his first appearance in the iconic arcade game, Donkey Kong, released in 1981. Originally referred to as \\"Jumpman\\", this seemingly innocuous character went on to lay the foundation for one of the most successful video game franchises in history. Mario's profession - which has become synonymous with the character's identity - is that of a plumber. This choice of profession for Mario was likely influenced by the game's environmental design, which frequently featured underground pipes, water maintenance systems, and sewer-like atmospheres. The original Mario Bros. game, launched in 1983, saw Mario and his brother, Luigi, working together to eliminate creatures lurking in the Sewer Works of New York City. As the game evolved, the plumbing profession remained an integral part of Mario's character and the overall narrative of the games. Throughout the myriad Super Mario games that have been released since his inception, Mario's plumbing background has manifested in various ways. For instance, one commonly known and iconic ability of Mario is his capacity to traverse through the game's landscape by sliding through large pipes. These green pipes, which are signature to the franchise, facilitate Mario's travel between various worlds and levels, solidifying his identity as a plumber. Another instance of Mario's profession affecting the game design can be seen in the numerous aquatic or water-related stages and worlds that are seen across the franchise's titles. These levels often depict Mario interacting with various water creatures, navigating waterlogged landscapes, and even swimming and diving in order to overcome challenges. Mario's character design also subtly reflects his profession as a plumber. Sporting denim overalls, a red hat, and gloves, his attire illustrates the practical garb of a blue-collar worker. Furthermore, his trademark mustache is reminiscent of an old-fashioned plumber stereotype. In summary, the video game character Super Mario, created by Nintendo in the 1980s, has a profession that is both central to his personal narrative and to the game's design elements. Mario's profession as a plumber is woven into numerous aspects of the franchise's games, from its subterranean settings, pipe-based transportation, and water-themed levels, to his character wardrobe and aesthetic. This choice of profession has allowed Mario to stand out uniquely among video game characters and has become a defining feature of one of the most popular and enduring video game franchises in history."},{"question":"Answer this question. Henri Landru was a mass murderer under what nickname was he better known","response":"Henri Landru, born on April 12, 1869, in Paris, France, was a notorious French serial killer who was better known by the nickname \\"Bluebeard,\\" inspired by the French folktale \\"La Barbe bleue.\\" The nickname was attributed to him because of the similarities between his criminal activities and the folktale's central character. Just like the mythical figure Bluebeard, who murdered his wives, Landru preyed on women and deceived them before killing them. Henri Landru came from a modest background, and his criminal history began with minor offenses related to fraud and theft. In the early 20th century, Landru started using personal advertisements in newspapers to lure women who were seeking companionship or marriage. He pretended to be a wealthy, single widower looking for love and, in this way, managed to lure many unsuspecting women. Most of his victims were middle-aged, lonely women with some degree of financial security. Landru would gain the trust of these women and persuade them to give him access to their financial resources on the pretext of investing in various ventures or businesses. Once he had taken control of their money and assets, he would kill his victims and dispose of their bodies, which were usually burned in his large oven. Landru's criminal activities went on for several years, and it is speculated that he murdered at least ten women and one teenage boy (the son of one of his victims). His deeds finally caught up with him in 1919 when he was arrested and charged with the murders. He was cunning and evasive during his trial, refusing to reveal any details about the whereabouts of his victims' remains or admit any guilt. Despite this, the overwhelming evidence against him, including personal belongings of his victims found at his home, led to his conviction on February 1, 1921. Henri Landru was executed by guillotine on February 25, 1922. The story of Henri Landru, the real-life \\"Bluebeard,\\" serves as a chilling example of how a serial killer can take advantage of the trust and vulnerability of lonely individuals for personal gain. His psychological manipulation, charm, and deceitful tactics allowed him to deceive, exploit, and ultimately murder unsuspecting victims without being caught for several years—making his case a stark warning to be cautious about whom we trust and let into our lives."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"Cheerleaders in maroon skirts and maroon and white sleeveless shirts.\\" can we conclude that \\"Cheering on the team.\\"?

Problem:Passage: The Mozart family grand tour was a journey through western Europe, undertaken by Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their musically gifted children Maria Anna (Nannerl) and Wolfgang Amadeus from 1763 to 1766. At the start of the tour the children were aged eleven and seven respectively. Their extraordinary skills had been demonstrated during a visit to Vienna in 1762, when they had played before the Empress Maria Theresa at the Imperial Court. Sensing the social and pecuniary opportunities that might accrue from a prolonged trip embracing the capitals and main cultural centres of Europe, Leopold obtained an extended leave of absence from his post as deputy Kapellmeister to the Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg. Throughout the subsequent tour, the children's Wunderkind status was confirmed as their precocious performances consistently amazed and gratified their audiences. The first stage of the tour's itinerary took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels and then on to Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, heard much music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766. The material rewards of the tour, though reportedly substantial, did not transform the family's lifestyle, and Leopold continued in the Prince-Archbishop's service. However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician. Question: What location did the touring musician family return to at the end of the tour?

It begins with the intriguing tale of an American GI who, driven perhaps by his desire for the excitingly illicit or by an inherent appetite for danger, goes AWOL. Not only does this man desert his post, but he also steals an army truck, disappearing into the mysterious underworld of London's black market. The American GI, who walked this daring path, is identified as Karl Hulten in the film. Hulten is not your typical soldier, he’s portrayed as a courageous yet misguided individual, who preferred the thrill of the London streets over the stern discipline and order of the military. Sneaking through the shadows, he navigates through the winding lanes of London, blending with the intriguing mix of characters that populate these enigmatic alleys. As his escapade in London continues, Hulten crosses paths with a woman named Betty Jones, who is crucial to his unfolding narrative. Betty is not a random bystander, but an integral character that adds a new dimension to Karl's adventures. She is a decisive and influential figure, unafraid of the potentially dangerous man standing before her. In an even darker twist, Karl Hulten is unveiled as Chicago Joe during the course of the film. This isn't just a random pseudonym; it is significant for it indicates his connection with the notorious gangsters of Chicago. He is not merely an absent soldier; rather, he is doing advance work in London for these encroaching Chicago gangsters. His task: to lay the groundwork for their impending arrival. Thus, Hulten's role in this narrative is ever more complex and his story becomes further shrouded in suspense. However, it doesn't take long for Betty to see through Karl's façade. Rather than repelling her, Karl's dark world proves enticing to Betty who is drawn to the thrill and risks it poses. She not only refrains from turning him in but, indeed, pushes him further down the path of crime. Betty manipulates Karl into initiating a spree of petty crimes across the city. She becomes the accomplice, providing a potent mix of allure and betrayal that sustains their adrenaline-fueled exploits. In the end, what surfaces is a haunting portrayal of crime, passion, and a demon called adventure. The tale of Karl Hulten, alias Chicago Joe, and Betty Jones unfurls across the screen as they navigate the fringes of society in the pursuit of their misadventures. Unabashed, enthralling, and utterly captivating, the film \\"American GI\\" proves to be a profound exploration of human nature, driven by ambition, manipulation, and the enduring allure of the unlawful."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose mushrooms are larger and healthier happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"To answer this question, we must first determine if there is any direct or indirect connection between the perturbation hypothesis (mushrooms growing larger and healthier) and the process of a butterfly's life cycle. We can do this by examining each step of the process and looking for potential connections. Step 1: A butterfly starts as an egg There doesn't seem to be any connection between mushrooms and butterfly eggs at this stage. Step 2: The egg hatches No apparent connection here either. Step 3: A larva emerges Still no connection to mushrooms. Step 4: The larva eats and grows Now we must consider the diet of the larva. Different species of butterflies have larvae that feed on various types of host plants. It's possible that some species' larvae might consume mushrooms as part of their diet. If that were the case, larger and healthier mushrooms could potentially provide more nourishment for the larvae, leading to faster growth and better survival rates. However, if mushrooms aren't a part of a butterfly larva's diet, then there's no direct connection at this stage. Step 5: The larva sheds its skin No apparent connection to mushrooms. Step 6: The larva enters a chrysalis No connection here either. Step 7: The pupa grows inside the chrysalis Again, no direct connection. Step 8: The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis No connection. Step 9: The adult butterfly is now fully grown No direct connection with mushrooms. Step 10: The adult butterfly lays more eggs We must consider if the adult butterfly feeds on mushrooms. If it does, larger and healthier mushrooms could provide more energy and nutrients, potentially leading to increased egg production. In summary, the supposed perturbation of larger and healthier mushrooms may have an effect on the butterfly's life cycle if mushrooms play a role in the diet of the larvae or adult butterflies. If this is the case, the increase in mushroom size and health could potentially lead to MORE butterflies, not less, as it would provide a better food source allowing for improved survival and reproduction rates. If mushrooms are not part of their diet, then the perturbation has no direct or indirect effect on the process."},{"question":"If \\"A man in a brownish green shirting playing guitar singing into a microphone\\", does this mean that \\"A male musician in earth-tone clothing is performing.\\"?

WASHINGTON | WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker plans to leave his role as head of a panel of experts advising President Barack Obama on the economy, sources familiar with the decision said on Wednesday. The departure of Volcker, 83, from the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board is among a series of changes Obama is planning to announce soon. The decision to leave the board was Volcker's. A source close to him said he was ready to continue to advise Obama on an informal basis as often as the president would like. Volcker became a legendary figure on Wall Street when as Fed chief he broke the back of double-digit U.S. inflation in the early 1980s by sharply raising interest rates. He began advising Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign and has wielded clout on issues ranging from financial regulation to fiscal policy. Unique among people who offer economic counsel to Obama from the outside, Volcker has a direct line to the president and does not need to go through the White House economic team to schedule a meeting or a phone call. But there have been moments of awkwardness for him. Volcker frequently delivers speeches to policy and business audiences, and it has been frustrating for him that when he comments publicly on issues like a value-added tax, his presidential advisory board role has sometimes led people to mistakenly assume he is speaking on behalf of the White House. The White House declined to comment on Volcker's exit. The formal announcement of Volcker's departure is likely to come on Friday when Obama will unveil a number of other changes to his economic team. The former central banker was the driving force behind the \\"Volcker Rule,\\" a provision in last year's financial reform bill that puts limits on proprietary trading by U.S. banks. Many on Wall Street vigorously fought the Volcker Rule and some sought to portray Volcker as out of touch with the modern financial system. But he has also received credit for reining in financial industry excesses that helped prompt the global economic crisis. \\"VOICE OF REASON\\" \\"My feeling is job well done,\\" said Thomas Russo, a partner in Gardner Russo & Gardner, a Pennsylvania investment manager with assets under management of 2.38 billion. \\"He was a voice of reason as he addressed excesses that inevitably develop in Wall Street conduct when the guardrails are taken down from the financial superhighway.\\" Obama also plans to make an announcement on a replacement for Larry Summers, who stepped down as director of the National Economic Council to return to his role on the faculty of Harvard University. Gene Sperling, a senior U.S. Treasury official, is the frontrunner to take the helm at the economic council, which coordinates advice to the president throughout the administration. ||||| He's one of the greatest economists of our time and tamed inflation as Fed chief, but when Paul Volcker resigns as Obama's adviser, he'll be forever tied to a watered-down financial reform that won't prevent another collapse. One of the saddest things about Paul Volcker’s probable resignation as one of President Obama’s top economic advisers is how he will be remembered. He won’t just be the Fed chairman who decades earlier performed a national service by defeating the economic evil known as inflation, but the bureaucrat who helped craft a convoluted financial “reform” law that has done little in the way of reforming activities that caused the 2008 financial collapse. I am of course talking about the so-called Volcker Rule, a key provision of last year’s massive Dodd-Frank financial-reform act that was supposed to curtail Wall Street risk-taking but which even Volcker these days is disavowing. Volcker, it should be noted, came to the Obama administration with great fanfare. And why shouldn’t he have? One of the greatest economists of modern times, he was largely responsible for repairing the economy from “stagflation”—high unemployment and high inflation—and for the ensuing economic prosperity of the next three decades. Now he was advising a bright new president on how to rebound from the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed. But Volcker spent much of his first year in the administration with very little influence on economic policy. The White House and its economic brain trust of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, chief economist Larry Summers, and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett were still cozying up to bankers and campaign contributors like JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein. They didn’t want to hear advice from the crazy old man who showed up occasionally at economic policy meetings and groused about putting an end to Wall Street risk-taking once and for all. Volcker didn’t seem to care. He spent long hours devising his plan to take Wall Street out of the risk-taking business, meeting occasionally with bankers he knew and trusted from his days as Fed chairman and later as a chief economist for an independent investment firm. These people said he spent most of his time listening to how Wall Street changed over the past three decades leading to the financial collapse, how it became less of a business that was paid to give advice and more of a gambling den that rolled the dice with shareholders' money with little accountability from regulators. The great Paul Volcker spent his last days in public service putting his name to a watered-down rule that wouldn’t have prevented the financial collapse of 2008 and won’t prevent one in the future. Paul Volcker. Credit: Joshua Roberts / Bloomberg via Getty Images With that, Volcker came up with a plan that he believed would stop a crisis of the magnitude of the one that hit in 2008 and led to the destruction of two firms, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and the near destruction of the rest, from happening again. The banks, he believed, would no long be able to risk the firm’s own capital and blow it in a single trade. The banks would have to sell off other risky businesses like hedge funds and private-equity accounts not just because they created the opportunity to lose lots of money but also because, like trading, they have little to do with what Wall Street is supposed to be about—dispensing advice to corporations as well as investors. Volcker, of course, had never really liked the big banks. He once quipped that the greatest innovation coming from the men of high finance was the ATM. He didn’t like the banks when he was Fed chairman, certainly not when he was out of government (just check some of his speeches), and certainly not now. And because of that, the bankers’ friends in high places, namely Geithner and Summers and ultimately the president himself, marginalized Volcker’s plan to make Wall Street a safer place. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"A man named Paul Volcker, who is very smart with money things, used to be in charge of a group that advised President Obama on the economy.

A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - The bamboos are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Michelia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Magnolia family ( Magnoliaceae ) . The genus includes about 50 species of evergreen trees and shrubs , native to tropical and subtropical south and southeast Asia ( Indomalaya ) , including southern China . - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China. - Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Liriodendron is a genus of two species of characteristically large deciduous trees in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae). - The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants. Classification. The Magnoliales include six families: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Magnoliaceae are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which \\"Magnolia\\" is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which \\"Liriodendron\\" (tulip trees) is the only genus. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include: - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).

Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011.

After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998.

Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. Context: Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records in 2001. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \\"I Wanna Talk About Me\\" as a single. Staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, however, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single. Instead, Giant released \\"Austin\\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after its release, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. \\"Austin\\" spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. Warner released his self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the top 20 hits \\"All Over Me\\", which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and \\"Ol' Red\\". Although Shelton's rendition of \\"Ol' Red\\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert. Blake Shelton received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies. Blake Shelton received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called \\"Austin\\" \\"tremendously imaginative\\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley. Country Standard Time was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that it \\"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\\". Shelton's second album, The Dreamer, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \\"The Baby\\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\\"Heavy Liftin'\\" and \\"Playboys of the Southwestern World\\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No. 24, The Dreamer earned gold certification as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single \\"The Truth About Men\\". Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004. Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write \\"When Somebody Knows You That Well\\", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \\"Some Beach\\" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single \\"Goodbye Time\\". Both this cover and its followup, \\"Nobody but Me\\", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection. On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including \\"Nobody but Me\\", appeared on the TV movie The Christmas Blessing, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T.

The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","response":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the area in Texas will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire. The explanation for this inference is given in the hint provided. Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours due to factors such as lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight during the day warms the ground, causing air currents to travel uphill. These air currents fan the wildfires and often follow the terrain over hills and through valleys. In the United States, wildfire operations are planned around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable rise in intensity resulting from daytime warmth. In the described scenario, the brush fire in Southwest Texas is occurring during the daytime, where conditions such as higher temperatures and increased winds make wildfires more intense. Meanwhile, the forest fire in Northwest Seattle is taking place at nighttime when the land is cooler and air currents travel downhill, resulting in less intense fires. Therefore, considering the difference in time and how wildfire intensity is influenced by daytime conditions, it is likely that the area in Texas is experiencing higher wind speeds during the fire than the area in Seattle."},{"question":"Individuals with surname LAPP Make this lower case","response":"Individuals with the surname Lapp can be found in various regions around the world, particularly in areas with German, Swiss, or Scandinavian origins. The Lapp surname, which is sometimes spelled as \\"Lap\\" or \\"Laap,\\" has various meanings and historical backgrounds depending on the region or culture it comes from. Here, we provide a detailed and long analysis of individuals with the Lapp surname and examine the possible origins and meanings of this unique name. In the Scandinavian countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and Finland, the Lapp surname might have been derived from the indigenous Sami people, who were historically referred to as \\"Lapps.\\" The Sami are a group of people who have lived in the northern regions of Scandinavia for thousands of years.

Options: - lose weight - loosing - loosing - loss - reduce Reasoning process:","response":"1. Understand the context: The question is about someone gaining a lot of fat and what their doctor is likely to advise them to do. 2. Analyze the options: a. lose weight - This option refers to the process of shedding excess body weight, typically achieved through a combination of exercise, healthy eating, and lifestyle changes. b. loosing - This option is incorrectly spelled and does not provide any clear meaning or action. The correct spelling would be \\"losing,\\" which in the context of weight indicates the process of becoming lighter. c. loosing - This option is a repetition of option b, which is incorrect. d. loss - This option is a noun that refers to the act or an instance of losing something, such as weight. However, it does not suggest a specific course of action or advice from a doctor. e. reduce - This option means to make something smaller or less in degree, but it does not directly refer to the concept of losing weight, although it is relevant. 3.

The typical household had £26,332 to spend after taxes were paid and benefits received, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Retired households saw a faster rise than others compared with the previous year, owing primarily to income from private pensions. The richest fifth of the population saw a slight fall in their spending power. The average UK household saw their disposable income rise by £564 compared with the previous year, after the rising cost of living - measured by inflation - was taken into account, the ONS said. Senior statistician Claudia Wells said: \\"Household incomes are above their pre-downturn peak overall, but not everyone is better off. \\"While retired households' incomes have soared in recent years, non-retired households still have less money, on average, than before the crash.\\" The median average disposable income of pensioner households has recorded a rise of 13% since 2007-08, compared with a 1.2% fall among non-retired households. The ONS puts growing private pensions ahead of the guaranteed rise in the state pension - under the so-called triple lock - as the long-term reason for the pick-up in pensioners' incomes. However, the £21,770 of typical spending power for retired households remains below the £28,481 of non-retired households. The top fifth of households saw real incomes fall back by £1,000 a year, while the poorest gained £700 on average in 2015-16, the ONS said. Top pay levels have come under pressure, but employment prospects and pay for the poorest have improved, it added. The figures come as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would like to see a maximum cap on the amount people can earn. Household income has tended to pick up faster over the years owing to an increasing number of couples both in employment. Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: \\"It was another strong year for living standards, particular for poorer households. Strong employment growth, low inflation and rising pensioner incomes over recent years have helped drive inequality down to its lowest level in nearly 30 years. \\"However, the last three years of growth have come back off the back of a living standards squeeze so deep that typical working age families are still £345 poorer than they were before the financial crisis. \\"With employment plateauing, productivity growth refusing to budge and inflation rising, the risk is that this mini boom won't continue.\\" Former chancellor George Osborne tweeted that \\"ONS data today shows inequality fell in 2015/16 & incomes of poorest rose.

Two weeks later Sarah takes Derek, who hasn't spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. and the situation: Two engineering students learned about petroleum products, While Dan learned more about plastics, Jim learned about fuels.

Twilight: This is a term used to describe the time of day when the sun is just below the horizon, creating atmospheric lighting effects. It is a concept related to atmospheric phenomenology, time, and light. 2. Mighty Oak Tree: This concept introduces vegetation, specifically a type of tree common to many parts of the world. The term \\"mighty\\" suggests size, strength, or resilience, frequently associated with oak trees. This concept is connected to botany and ecology. 3. Hundreds of Years Old: This notion introduces the concept of time, age, historical continuity, and longevity. This suggests the perspective of time on a scale that is often beyond human lifespan. 4. Rustling Leaves: This phrase invokes the concept of sound (rustling), a tactile response (leaves moving), and the implication of wind (cause of the rustle). It includes concepts from meteorology (wind), acoustics (rustling sounds), and botany (leaves). 5. Gentle Breeze: This introduces another weather-related concept, related to wind velocities at the lower end of the scale, implying a soft, gentle movement of air.

Answer choices: - movement - Chemical energy - by fighting - through play - by eating - when they sleep - stamina - Riding a bike Answer:","response":"Through play Animals, especially young ones, learn various actions essential for their survival, growth, and social interaction primarily through play. Play is a crucial aspect in the cognitive and physical development of animals, as it serves as a platform for experimentation, practice, and the reinforcement of vital behaviors. When animals engage in play, they acquire and perfect motor skills, social skills, and problem-solving abilities that can be applied to different situations as they grow up and navigate their environment. Playing is an effective and safe method for learning because it allows animals to engage in potentially challenging or threatening situations without facing the same risks they would in real life. For instance, play fighting is a common form of play among many young animals, such as kittens, puppies, and young primates. Through play fighting, these animals can practice their predatory skills, including stalking, chasing, and grappling, that will be necessary when they need to hunt or defend themselves in the future. Furthermore, playing enables the development of social skills and communication among group or family members. Animals can practice establishing dominance, submission, cooperation, and other essential social behaviors during play, which will be beneficial in ensuring cohesion and maintaining the structure of their social group. For example, young wolves learn how to communicate with each other, identify their ranks, and build relationships with other pack members, all while engaging in playful interactions. Additionally, play helps animals refine their problem-solving and decision-making abilities. While playing, animals often encounter various obstacles, challenges, and opportunities for exploration, which require them to adjust their behaviors and develop innovative solutions. Such cognitive skills are valuable in enabling them to adapt and survive in a constantly changing environment. In summary, animals learn actions primarily through play. By engaging in playful activities, they can safely develop their motor skills, social skills, and cognitive abilities, which are essential for their growth, survival, and social cohesion. As they play, animals explore their surroundings, experiment with different behaviors, communicate, and learn from each other, thereby enhancing their understanding of their environment and improving their capacity to navigate it effectively."},{"question":"Select from the following.

The website says a credit card will help children master responsible spending habits and give parents the chance to teach them some valuable lessons. It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. Options: A To avoid extremely high overdraft fees. B To encourage them to share household expenses. C To teach them to be responsible credit card users. D To help them pay close attention to their bank account. Answer: C To teach them to be responsible credit card users.

Photo: Paul Chinn / The Chronicle Buy photo Photo: Paul Chinn / The Chronicle Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Millennium Tower homeowners propose 100 million solution to sinking problem 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Homeowners in the sinking Millennium Tower on Tuesday will submit a permit application to shore up the 58-story building by drilling more than 50 new piles down to bedrock, a nearly 100 million fix. In an application to be filed with the city’s Department of Building Inspection, the Millennium Tower Association laid out plans for a “perimeter pile upgrade,” 52 steel and concrete piles that would shift a portion of the building’s weight from its existing foundation system to bedrock about 250 feet below. While the application outlines about 30 million worth of work, the entire pile upgrade would cost nearly 100 million and take 18 months. The contractor would drill 22 new piles along Mission Street and 30 along Fremont Street. Each pile is 24 inches in diameter and weighs 140,000 pounds and would take three or four days to drill into place. A reinforced concrete “inner pile” would be installed within each steel shaft. That shift would relieve stress on soils that have compressed beneath the building, causing it to settle more than anticipated and to tilt, according to engineer Ronald Hamburger of the firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, which designed the plan. The new piles on the north and west sides would limit future settlement of the tower to minimal levels and reverse the building’s tilt, according to Hamburger. “We have high confidence in the engineers who designed this retrofit, and we look forward to working with the city and county of San Francisco to get the project under way,” said Howard Dickstein, president of the Millennium Tower Association’s Center board of directors. “While the city and other experts have always certified the building as safe, this solution will eliminate any lingering questions about its stability and ensure future settlement is within the normal range.” Photo: Paul Chinn / The Chronicle A man walks past the Millennium Tower in San Francisco, Calif. on... One of the city’s flashiest luxury condo towers when it opened in April 2009, the Millennium, at 301 Mission St., has become notorious internationally over the past two years as San Francisco’s leaning tower, settling 18 inches and leaning 14 inches to the west. The flawed foundation sparked multiple lawsuits from residents against the developer, Millennium Partners, as well as the architect and engineers who designed the concrete and glass building. Mission Street Development LLC, the tower’s original developer, agreed to perform and warrant the retrofit, which would eventually be paid for by a settlement reached in ongoing, confidential mediation. Hamburger said the soils that are most heavily stressed are along the north and west sides of the building. That is because there is a deep garage on the east side, and the train box for the Transbay Transit Center is on the south side. “It’s primarily the soils on the north and west side that are overstressed and as a result are compressing and allowing the building to settle and tilt,” said Hamburger. The plan will be reviewed by a panel of experts, and if everything goes well, work could start in the late winter or early spring. The work would be underground and should not cause much of a disturbance to residents, Hamburger said. “There won’t be a lot of noise or pounding or vibration from the operation,” he said . The tower sits on a 10-foot-thick concrete mat foundation, held in place by 950 reinforced concrete piles driven up to 90 feet deep. Under the retrofit plan, the 52 new piles would extend into bedrock beneath the compressible soils currently causing the settlement. They would be connected to the existing foundation by an extension of the concrete mat. While it’s common for buildings downtown to be built on shorter friction piles as the Millennium is, the height of the tower and its concrete frame make it heavier than neighboring high-rises. The developer, an affiliate of Millennium Partners, has been working with the homeowners for months to reach agreement on an appropriate plan to address harm caused to the residential tower by its settlement as well as tilting associated with surrounding construction activities by the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which built the Transbay Terminal, and the developer of Salesforce Tower. The developers blamed the sinking on dewatering that took place during the construction of the adjacent Transbay Transit Center, which they argued weakened the soil under the tower’s foundation. Philip Aarons, a principal at Millennium Partners, said that the additional piles would make the tower “one of the safest buildings in California.” “We have made clear from the beginning that getting to a ‘fix’ has been Mission Street Development’s top priority,” Aarons said. In the 30 months since news broke of the building’s structural problems, the 419-unit tower has been in limbo, with few units on the market, and those are selling for well under asking. In April, a four-bedroom unit sold for 4.66 million, 23 percent less than the asking price, and 13 percent less than it went for in May 2014. “It will continue to trade at a discount until it’s fixed,” said Chris Foley, a partner with Polaris Pacific, which markets and sells new condos. “Once it is fixed, it will trade at market, but it will never be a premier building again.” Part of the hope of the retrofit is that it will “restore the reputation of the building,” said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the developer. J.K. Dineen is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: jdineen@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @sfjkdineen ||||| The building has been given the nickname \\"the leaning tower of San Francisco.\\" Eric Risberg/AP At 58 stories and 645 feet high, the luxury Millennium Tower is the tallest concrete structure in San Francisco. It's also one of the most unstable. On Saturday, an apartment owner detected a large fissure in his window on the high-rise's 36th floor, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Earlier that day, residents reported hearing a series of creaking noises, followed by a loud pop. As of Tuesday, the building's management company had 72 hours to report on the issue. Though officials blocked off part of the sidewalk, a spokesperson for the Department of Building Inspection said there was no safety risk for pedestrians. It's concerning news for inhabitants of 301 Mission Street, who have already had to contend with the fact that their building is sinking. In 2016, an independent consultant found the tower had sunk 16 inches and tilted 2 inches to the northwest since its completion in 2008. By 2018, it had sunk an additional inch and tilted another 12 inches. The builders originally anticipated that the structure would sink only 4 to 6 inches over the course of its lifetime. This rapid shift has led to speculation that the building's facade is separating from its interior, making it vulnerable to an earthquake or fire. Stress gauges have been used to measure floor-to-ceiling cracks in the parking garage of the Millennium Tower. Eric Risberg/AP While the Department of Building Inspection has since determined that the tower is safe to live in, residents are concerned about their investments. When the building first opened, its units sold for anywhere from 1.6 million to more than 10 million. Since then, around 100 condo owners have each seen a 320,000 drop on average in their apartment value. The high-rise has also endured a string of lawsuits, including one spearheaded by the homeowners' association. Developers have gone back and forth over who's to blame. Millennium Partners, the real estate company behind the tower, cites the 2010 construction of the recently-completed Salesforce Transit Center as the reason for the sinking. The developers contend that construction workers pumped too much water out of the ground while the transit center was being built, causing the sand to compress and the tower to settle. But the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which oversaw the center's development, argue that the sinking started before they broke ground. Earlier this year, engineers proposed a solution to the tower's structural instability: a project with a price tag up to 500 million that involves anchoring the building to bedrock, which is more compact and tends to shake less than sand. Until then, residents may continue to witness unsettling damages, such as cracks in the basement or malfunctioning elevators, as the tower continues to shift. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Homeowners of San Francisco's sinking Millennium Tower have proposed a nearly 100 million solution to shore up the 58-story building by drilling more than 50 new piles down to bedrock.

However, what is less known is how Huppert's journey to international acclaim with 'Elle' almost never happened, as the movie faced numerous unforeseen changes before releasing in France. This article explores the transformation of 'Elle' from a Hollywood production to a French feature that catapulted Huppert to new heights. Development of the Film: 'Elle,' directed by Paul Verhoeven, is an adaptation of Phillipe Djian's novel 'Oh...' published in 2012. The intriguing psychological thriller follows the story of Michele Leblanc, a successful businesswoman who deals with the aftermath of a violent attack. The film meanders through themes of trauma, revenge, and power dynamics, leaving audience members captivated and, at times, uncomfortable. Originally, the filmmakers planned on setting that story in an American context, casting Hollywood actors and producing the movie in the United States. Producers were shopping the project around, hoping to secure an American A-list actress for the leading role. However, despite the initial interest in the source material, the adaptation faced significant challenges during its pre-production phase. Obstacles and Transformation: Verhoeven himself said that he encountered issues in convincing Hollywood studios and actors to participate in the project. The film's controversial content, which touches upon themes such as sexual assault and the portrayal of unconventional relationships, proved to be a hard sell for American studios. Some actresses were reportedly hesitant to commit to the role due to the intense subject matter and potential backlash. As the production faced mounting obstacles in Hollywood, the decision was made to shift the project to France and create a French-language film, with a French cast and crew. This transformation was a strategic move to accommodate the creative talents who would be more receptive to the movie's content. Enter Isabelle Huppert, a seasoned French actress whose repertoire consists of more than 100 films. She was deemed the perfect fit for Michele Leblanc and willingly took on the challenging role. Huppert's Golden Opportunity: Huppert's performance in 'Elle' is nothing short of extraordinary. Despite the disturbing nature of the film, Huppert's portrayal of Michele brings depth and humanity to the character. Her complex portrayal of a woman navigating through the dark consequences of her past and present quickly garnered widespread acclaim from audiences and critics alike. Her work on 'Elle' earned Huppert a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress – a significant milestone in her already impressive career. Had the movie remained a Hollywood production as initially planned, Huppert likely would not have had the opportunity to take on the role that not only challenged her acting abilities but also further elevated her standing in the international film scene. Conclusion: Isabelle Huppert's outstanding performance in 'Elle' serves as a testament to the power of compelling storytelling, even in the face of controversy. The film's metamorphosis from a Hollywood production to a French feature is a testament to the passionate talents behind the film who believed in the importance of staying true to the source material. As a result, audiences were treated to a thought-provoking and incredibly well-acted film that will be remembered for years to come. In the end, Huppert's near-miss opportunity is yet another lesson for the film industry – don't be too quick to underestimate a story's potential simply based on its sensitivity to conventional norms."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the official worldwide organization in charge of collecting observational data for minor planets (such as asteroids) and comets, calculating their orbits and publishing this information via the \\"Minor Planet Circulars\\".

Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Should I validate this answer?","response":"No, this answer should not be validated because it does not directly address the provided question. The question asked about the sources of Vitamin D, but the provided answer generalized the definition of a vitamin without specifying about Vitamin D. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"where is Vitamin D found?\\" would be: Vitamin D is primarily obtained in three ways: through exposure to the sun, through certain types of food, and through supplements. 1. Sun exposure: Our bodies naturally produce Vitamin D when skin is directly exposed to sunlight. In particular, sunlight's ultraviolet B (UVB) rays lead to the production of Vitamin D. However, the efficiency of Vitamin D production can be influenced by a number of factors including the latitude and altitude of your location, the current season, time of the day, air pollution, cloud coverage, and the melanin content in your skin. 2. Food: Although it's difficult to get enough Vitamin D solely through food, certain foods are naturally rich in Vitamin D. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are among the best natural food sources. Other sources include cod liver oil, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Some mushrooms are also high in Vitamin D, particularly those exposed to ultraviolet light. 3. Supplements: Many people find it hard to get enough Vitamin D naturally, particularly those living in polar regions or who spend a lot of time indoors. In such cases, Vitamin D supplements can help reach the needed daily intake. Remember, even though Vitamin D is beneficial, like all vitamins and nutrients, it should be consumed in moderation. Too much Vitamin D can lead to toxicity, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. In severe cases, it can lead to problems with heart rhythm and damage to the kidneys. It's always best to consult a healthcare provider when considering dietary supplements."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Romanian: BiH attempts to develop renewable energy sources","response":"BiH încearcă să dezvolte surse de energie regenerabilă.

This activity involves understanding and working with various physical objects and components, each with its own properties and functions. To build a bicycle from scratch, one needs to be familiar with the different parts of a bicycle, their properties, how they are assembled, and how they work together to enable smooth and efficient movement when riding the bicycle. Here is a detailed and long answer explaining the different physical objects involved in this task and their roles within the bicycle assembly. 1. Frame: The frame is the backbone of the bicycle, providing structure and support for all other components. It is generally made of materials such as steel, aluminum, titanium, or carbon fiber, chosen for their strength, durability, and weight properties. One must know the appropriate size and geometry that suits the rider's body and preferred style of riding. 2. Fork: The fork is the element that connects the front wheel to the frame. In many bicycles, it also provides suspension to absorb shocks and vibrations from the road surface. Understanding the mechanism of the fork and how it affects the handling of the bike is essential. 3. Wheels: The wheels are the foundation of the bicycle's motion and consist of various parts such as rims, spokes, hubs, and tires. Knowledge of how to choose the appropriate wheel size, tire type, and air pressure for the intended use of the bicycle is crucial. 4. Drivetrain: The drivetrain is a complex system comprising the chainrings, chain, cassette, derailleurs, and shifters, responsible for transmitting power from the rider's pedal strokes to the rear wheel. Understanding how each component functions and fits together is important to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer of power. 5. Pedals: The pedals provide the platform for the rider's feet to push and propel the bike forward. Different types of pedals are suitable for various styles of riding (e.g., platform pedals, clipless pedals, or toe clips). Knowledge of how to install and adjust pedals to suit the rider's preference is essential. 6. Brakes: Brakes are critical for controlling the bike's speed and ensuring the safety of the rider. The most common types of brakes are rim brakes (caliper or v-brakes), disc brakes (hydraulic or mechanical), and coaster brakes. Familiarity with different braking systems, their components, and how to maintain them is vital. 7. Handlebar and Stem: The handlebar and stem play a crucial role in steering, handling, and overall comfort of the bicycle. Different handlebar shapes and stem lengths are available for various types of riders and riding styles. One must understand how to choose, assemble, and attach these components to ensure a comfortable and secure grip. 8. Seatpost and Saddle: The seatpost connects the saddle to the frame, allowing for height adjustments to accommodate the rider's leg length. The saddle provides a comfortable surface for the rider to sit on while pedaling. Proper selection and adjustment of these components are critical for a comfortable ride. 9. Headset and Bottom Bracket: The headset and bottom bracket are less visible but essential components that ensure smooth functioning between the frame and the forks and the cranks, respectively. Adequate knowledge of their role, types, and how to assemble and maintain them is necessary to avoid riding problems. 10. Cables and Housing: Cables and housing are necessary for transmitting input (from braking or shifting) to the corresponding component (brakes or derailleurs). Understanding the correct length and routing of cables, as well as how to properly attach and adjust them, is crucial for accurate and responsive operation. Building a bicycle from scratch requires a comprehensive understanding of these individual physical objects, as well as knowledge of how to assemble and configure them to create a functional, safe, and enjoyable cycling experience. The task involves practical skills such as measuring, cutting, tightening, alignment, and troubleshooting, all of which necessitate a strong foundation in the properties and capabilities of the involved components."},{"question":"No fringe benefits for emos as haircuts that flop over one eye could result in generation of young people with lazy eyes UNDER all those long lopsided fringes, a hidden danger is lurking. A leading optometrist has warned children and teenagers are risking their eyesight for the sake of fashion. Favoured by celebrities including Reece Mastin and Justin Bieber, the current zeal for haircuts with fringes that flop over one eye could result in a generation of young people with lazy eyes. Photos: Reece Mastin Photos: Justin Bieber Optometrists Association national executive member Andrew Hogan warned amblyopia - the medical term for lazy eye - could result from obstructed vision caused by hair. \\"If a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time, that eye won't see a lot of detail,\\" Mr Hogan said. \\"And if it happens from a young age, that eye can become amblyotic.\\" Mr Hogan said the most vulnerable age for visual development was birth to seven years, but research had shown vision could still be affected at later stages. As well as the potential damage to eyesight, there are also concerns that long \\"emo\\" sweep fringes could cause postural problems. Veteran hairdresser Roseanne Anderson fears the hairstyle forced many to tilt their heads to one side in order to see out of their small window of vision. \\"I have to wonder how they don't get a stiff neck,\\" the Hobart-based hairdresser said. \\"I have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when I think about it, this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing that could be a health hazard.\\" Mr Hogan said a curtain of hair over one eye could actually act like an eyepatch, limiting the eye's access to both sunlight and sensory stimulation. He said recent research had shown a lack of direct sunlight resulted in short sightedness. And hair constantly hanging over one eye could result in sensory deprivation that could weaken one eye and lead to amblyopia. \\"If you walk around with an eye patch on all day, then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye,\\" he added. Amblyopia occurs when the nerve pathway from one eye to the brain does not develop because the abnormal eye sends a blurred image to the brain. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Washington (CNN) -- The weirdest campaign ad of this season -- maybe any season -- debuted on the Internet this past week. The ad has been nicknamed, \\"Demon Sheep,\\" and can be viewed here. The ad is an opening salvo in what will could prove the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history. The incumbent, Barbara Boxer, has always been the less popular of California's two Democratic senators. Boxer now looks vulnerable. Two Republicans declared early for the nomination against Boxer: state Sen. Chuck DeVore and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Fiorina took an early lead. But her performance on the campaign trail disheartened many of her supporters. Worse, Fiorina never developed a good answer to the questions about her business career. Portfolio magazine had dubbed Fiorina one of the 20 worst CEOs of all time after a disastrous merger with Compaq.

This dismissal greatly contributed to the scrutiny she faced regarding her corporate experience, which Fiorina struggled to address on the campaign trail.

The bizarre \\"Demon Sheep\\" ad illustrated the highly competitive nature of the race and the unconventional tactics employed by the candidates. The California Senate race in question was expected to perhaps be the most expensive in US history, a testament to both the importance of the seat and the high stakes involved in the political contest.

Depending on the findings, we are prepared to take swift action to prevent the illegal use of child labor in the fields where we source Fairtrade-certified organic cotton in Burkina Faso.\\" Victoria's Secret, known for its underwear and lingerie, describes itself as \\"one of the most powerful, sexy and glamorous stores in the world.\\" Its fashion show recently aired in more than 90 countries. The statement from Ohio-based Limited Brands on Thursday followed an extensive report from Bloomberg that describes the life of a 13-year-old-girl who is beaten by the farmer she works for on a cotton field in Burkina Faso. The cotton picked by the girl went to factories in other countries, \\"where it was fashioned into Victoria's Secret underwear,\\" the report said. While forced labor and child labor are not new to African farms, Bloomberg noted, the girl works on a farm certified as organic and fair trade. Such farms \\"should be free of such practices,\\" the report said. \\"Perversely,\\" the article said, the lucrative premiums paid for organic and fair-trade cotton have \\"created fresh incentives for exploitation. The program has attracted subsistence farmers who say they don't have the resources to grow fair-trade cotton without violating a central principle of the movement: forcing other people's children into their fields. \\" The report cited the leader of Burkina Faso's organic and fair-trade program and the head of fair-trade organization Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation as saying that Victoria's Secret purchased all of Burkina Faso's organic crop from last season. A report earlier this year from the U.S. Labor Department found that child labor is used in cotton production in more than a dozen countries, including Burkina Faso. A press attache for the Burkina Faso Embassy in the United States had no immediate comment Thursday. In its statement Thursday, Limited Brands said that in 2007, it \\"established a pilot program to purchase Fairtrade-certified organic cotton from primarily women farmers in Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in West Africa that struggles with endemic poverty. We were committed to this initiative because of its potential to generate life-changing opportunities for some of the world's poorest women.\\" The \\"Charter of Fair Trade Principles,\\" published in 2009 by the World Fair Trade Organization and Fairtrade International, states that the rights of children are to be respected. \\"The importance of children's involvement in the work of family-based production units, and the learning of skills required for their working life is recognized, but any involvement must be disclosed and monitored and must not adversely affect the child's well-being, security, educational opportunities and need for play,\\" it says. ||||| Victoria’s Secret, whose supermodel “Angels” helped it set record sales and profits in the third quarter of 2011,...

Clarisse Kambire, 13, a child laborer, sits on a bench in the room where she sleeps in the home of her foster parent and his family. Close Clarisse Kambire, 13, a child laborer, begins her daily task of picking the crop from her farmer's field of fair trade organic cotton near Benvar, Burkina Faso, on Nov. 10, 2011. Close Clarisse Kambire’s nightmare rarely changes. It’s daytime. In a field of cotton plants that burst with purple and white flowers, a man in rags towers over her, a stick raised above his head. Then a voice booms, jerking Clarisse from her slumber and making her heart leap. “Get up!” The man ordering her awake is the same one who haunts the 13-year-old girl’s sleep: Victorien Kamboule, the farmer she labors for in a West African cotton field. Before sunrise on a November morning she rises from the faded plastic mat that serves as her mattress, barely thicker than the cover of a glossy magazine, opens the metal door of her mud hut and sets her almond-shaped eyes on the first day of this season’s harvest. (Follow her journey in videos, photos and more here.) She had been dreading it. “I’m starting to think about how he will shout at me and beat me again,” she said two days earlier. Preparing the field was even worse. Clarisse helped dig more than 500 rows with only her muscles and a hoe, substituting for the ox and the plow the farmer can’t afford. If she’s slow, Kamboule whips her with a tree branch. This harvest is Clarisse’s second. Cotton from her first went from her hands onto the trucks of a Burkina Faso program that deals in cotton certified as fair trade. The fiber from that harvest then went to factories in India and Sri Lanka, where it was fashioned into Victoria’s Secret underwear -- like the pair of zebra-print, hip-hugger panties sold for 8.50 at the lingerie retailer’s Water Tower Place store on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile. Clarisse’s Cotton “Made with 20 percent organic fibers from Burkina Faso,” reads a stamp on that garment, purchased in October. Forced labor and child labor aren’t new to African farms. Clarisse’s cotton, the product of both, is supposed to be different. It’s certified as organic and fair trade, and so should be free of such practices. Planted when Clarisse was 12, all of Burkina Faso’s organic crop from last season was bought by Victoria’s Secret (LTD), according to Georges Guebre, leader of the country’s organic and fair- trade program, and Tobias Meier, head of fair trade for Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation, a Zurich-based development organization that set up the program and has helped market the cotton to global buyers. Meier says Victoria’s Secret also was expected to get most of this season’s organic harvest, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its February issue. Telltale Green Flag The leader of the local fair-trade cooperative in Clarisse’s village confirmed that her farmer is one of the program’s producers. A telltale green flag, given to its growers, flies at the edge of the field she works. As Victoria’s Secret’s partner, Guebre’s organization, the National Federation of Burkina Cotton Producers, is responsible for running all aspects of the organic and fair-trade program across Burkina Faso. Known by its French initials, the UNPCB in 2008 co-sponsored a study suggesting hundreds, if not thousands, of children like Clarisse could be vulnerable to exploitation on organic and fair-trade farms. The study was commissioned by the growers and Helvetas. Victoria’s Secret says it never saw the report. Clarisse’s labor exposes flaws in the system for certifying fair-trade commodities and finished goods in a global market that grew 27 percent in just one year to more than 5.8 billion in 2010. That market is built on the notion that purchases by companies and consumers aren’t supposed to make them accomplices to exploitation, especially of children. Perverting Fair Trade In Burkina Faso, where child labor is endemic to the production of its chief crop export, paying lucrative premiums for organic and fair-trade cotton has -- perversely -- created fresh incentives for exploitation. The program has attracted subsistence farmers who say they don’t have the resources to grow fair-trade cotton without forcing other people’s children into their fields -- violating a key principle of the movement. An executive for Victoria’s Secret’s parent company says the amount of cotton it buys from Burkina Faso is minimal, but it takes the child-labor allegations seriously. “They describe behavior contrary to our company’s values and the code of labor and sourcing standards we require all of our suppliers to meet,” Tammy Roberts Myers, vice president of external communications for Limited Brands Inc., said in a statement. Victoria’s Secret is the largest unit of the Columbus, Ohio-based company. “Our standards specifically prohibit child labor,” she said. “We are vigorously engaging with stakeholders to fully investigate this matter.” In The Fields To understand the plight of Clarisse and others like her, Bloomberg News spent more than six weeks reporting in Burkina Faso, including interviewing Clarisse, her family, neighbors and leaders in her village. Her experiences were similar to those of six other children extensively interviewed by Bloomberg, such as an emaciated 12-year-old boy working in a nearby field. Interviews around the country with fair-trade growers, officers of fair-trade cooperatives and child-welfare officials reveal that there is little training and few if any safeguards against using children, even after dangers were uncovered by the 2008 report. Victoria’s Secret, whose supermodel “Angels” helped it set record sales and profit in the third quarter of 2011, agreed in 2007 to a deal to buy fair-trade and organic cotton from Burkina Faso. The aim was to purchase sustainable raw materials and benefit female African farmers. In time for Valentine’s Day 2009, the retailer marketed a special lingerie line made from “pesticide-free, 100 percent rain-fed cotton” and sold with the claim that each purchase improved lives in the country. ‘Good for Children’ “Good for women,” read a booklet accompanying a white thong covered with blue and lavender daisies. “Good for the children who depend on them.” The thong was labeled 95 percent organic. Today, such Burkinabe fiber is blended into lingerie at a much-reduced level, allowing the company to spread it across most of its cotton underwear lines, Lori Greeley, chief executive officer of Victoria’s Secret Stores, told a Wharton School publication in March. Growers sell the fiber to the company with fair-trade certification, though the finished garments no longer carry the “good for children” marketing message, nor do they have a fair-trade stamp. Victoria’s Secret has more than 1,000 stores in North America, and sells through its famously risque catalogs and around the world via the Internet. Mango-Tree Serenade An executive with Limited Brands’ sourcing and production arm, Margaret Wright, visited Burkina Faso in April. Women who produce organic cotton serenaded her under mango trees in the city of Tiefora, according to a press release from the national growers group. In Tiefora, about a 130-mile (210-kilometer) drive from Clarisse’s village of Benvar, Wright told them that the well-being of women was the main reason the company was interested in organic cotton, the release said. The company’s desire for fair-trade cotton testifies to the success of a labeling movement that began in the 1980s with small-scale Mexican coffee farmers and now boasts the involvement of consumer-goods giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Starbucks Corp. (SBX) The movement has boosted the profits of farmers in impoverished parts of the world. Fairtrade International, the world’s largest group of its kind, certified that Burkina Faso’s organic crop met its standards, says Tuulia Syvaenen, chief operating officer of the Bonn-based organization. Myers, of Limited Brands, says the company relied on that certification to meet its goal of “improving the lives of some of the world’s poorest women and children through the responsible sourcing of cotton -- something we have been doing through our efforts with Burkinabe women cotton farmers.” Program Under Review Fairtrade International started a review in Burkina Faso after Bloomberg News raised questions, says Syvaenen, adding it would begin a training program for farmers. She also says the UNPCB never gave Fairtrade a copy of the 2008 study it co- sponsored on child labor, which identified concerns about the vulnerability of so-called enfants confies, a French term used in West Africa for a type of foster child -- kids such as Clarisse. Bloomberg News obtained a copy of the study, which has never been made public, and spoke to a field investigator involved, as well as farmers who were originally interviewed for the report. With the exception of gold, cotton is produced with child or forced labor in more countries than any other commodity in the global supply chain, according to the U.S. Labor Department. One of those countries is Burkina Faso. In its reports, the department has repeatedly cited the country for the worst forms of child labor, while the State Department has done the same regarding child trafficking to conventional cotton fields there. None of those reports has ever specifically examined Burkina Faso’s organic and fair-trade crop. Lost Childhood Clarisse’s life and her experience in Victorien Kamboule’s field capture a childhood lost at the bottom of an American company’s purportedly ethical supply chain. As a little girl, Clarisse viewed the world around her with wide eyes, giving her a look of constant amazement, her mother says. Her expression earned her a nickname, Pree-Pree. In her family’s native tongue, Dagara, it roughly translates into “bug-eyed.” Though a term of endearment, it wasn’t terribly flattering. The girl, born in 1998 to migrant-worker parents in neighboring Ivory Coast, hated it. Still, Pree-Pree stuck. Pree-Pree’s Journey After her parents split up when she was about 4, Pree-Pree was shuttled between her father’s relatives on either side of the border until the age of 9. That’s when an aunt took her to the village of Benvar in Burkina Faso and left her in the sod- covered, mud-walled home of the farmer, Kamboule, where she lives today. Though they’re separated in age by a generation, Clarisse and Kamboule, 30, are cousins. Clarisse also is his enfant confie. In the room where Clarisse sleeps, a narrow wooden bench lines one wall. A few clothes washed by hand dry on a line strung along another. She has no dolls, no photos, not even a toothbrush. “Nothing,” she says. Kamboule, his wife, and their own children -- a 3-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy -- sleep together under a mosquito net on a bed in the adjoining room. The air inside the room where Clarisse sleeps is stale, heavy with the smell of perspiration. Except for the metal door, a small triangle is the only opening in the mud walls that surround her. It’s stuffed with a yellow rag, but when Kamboule wakes Clarisse for work she knows it’s still dark outside: Her mornings begin before dawn when the season demands it. After the farmer shouts her awake, “he tells me to go to the farm,” she says. Slinging a Hoe Clarisse steps outside after Kamboule has already pedaled his bicycle to the organic cotton plot. Slinging a hoe with a freshly sharpened blade over her shoulder, she makes her way alone along a ribbon of dirt, explaining how in the planting season in May and June she walks through a blanket of humidity and heat, when temperatures reach well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). The sun begins to rise as Clarisse approaches the empty field. She takes the hoe from her shoulder and clasps the handle, placing her right hand above her left along a patch of wood faded by wear. The grueling routine is so well-practiced that she demonstrates it with ease. Her hands are thick and strong, her thumbnails blackened. Her only possession, a gift from her grandmother, encircles her left wrist -- a bracelet of eight strings of orange and blue beads, as small as apple seeds, and a single strand of white ones. ‘It’s Painful’ Bending at the waist, Clarisse buries the edge of the blade and starts scraping a deep row into the earth, taking small steps backward with each cut. “It’s very, very hard,” she says, “and he forces me to do it.” Before long, her arms and hips ache. “It’s painful,” she says. When she strikes rocks beneath the soil, it sends the blade cutting into her bare toes. If she slows down from exhaustion, “he comes to beat me,” she says. He whips her across the back with the tree branch and shouts at her. “I cry,” she says, looking down as she speaks and rubbing the calluses on her hands. The two of them dig for weeks to carve a plot stretching the length of about four American football fields. Even in poor countries, this job is often performed by a beast tethered to a plow. But Burkina Faso ranked 181st out of 187 countries in the 2011 United Nations Human Development Index, and the farmers who force Clarisse and the other children to work don’t own animals. Even if they did, they say they don’t have access to a plow, which costs the equivalent of about 150 in Burkina Faso, where about 80 percent of the population lives on less than 2 a day. The farmers contend that they wouldn’t need child laborers if they had the right tools. Going Hungry Each afternoon, Clarisse walks back to the hut, exhausted. Some days, she says, the farmer’s wife brings her a starchy white paste, made from corn or millet. Her head bowed, Clarisse makes the sign of the cross with her right hand before raising her chin and sinking her fingers into the gelatinous paste. If she’s lucky, she’s fed once per day, she says. Some days, she doesn’t eat at all. Kamboule says he couldn’t raise fair-trade cotton without Clarisse. “If I leave the child out, how will I be able to do the work?” Kamboule says. He acknowledges striking her. “I sometimes beat her,” he says. “This is when I give her work and she doesn’t deliver.” As with Clarisse, his own parents left him with relatives to labor rather than attend school. Strong and lean, the illiterate farmer seems to toil endlessly, wearing the same pair of tattered shorts each day. Thousands of Farmers On small-plot farms like Kamboule’s across Burkina Faso, researchers sponsored by the growers federation in 2008 found that more than half of 89 producers surveyed had a total of 90 foster children under the age of 18. Many had two or more. The problem was acute in the country’s southwest, which is the heart of the program’s production and Clarisse’s home. There were about 7,000 fair-trade farmers in the program that year, according to data from Helvetas. The study found that two-thirds of foster children in homes like Kamboule’s weren’t in school when they were required to be. Fair-trade farmers told researchers they didn’t pay the kids, leading the study’s authors to write, “This category of children is a problem on several levels: in terms of their social vulnerability on the one hand, and in terms of their status at work on the other. These foster children have an employee status: they are clearly asked to work, as expressed in the words of the producers, but they receive no remuneration, regardless of age.” Wanting to Learn Some foster children also were abused or malnourished. Even though they’re legally required to be in school, fewer than one in three was enrolled in the southwest, in contrast to the farmers’ own children. “The study showed that the situation of the children is not a catastrophe, but they are quite weak,” says Meier, of Helvetas, adding that his group is “in favor” of implementing its recommendations. “But we cannot act ourself in this respect.” The bulk of the research focused on the work performed by the growers’ own kids, arguing that even when they were illegally kept out of school their labor was a beneficial form of vocational education. Clarisse was determined to attend school. Shortly after her aunt brought her to Burkina Faso, she set off without permission one winter morning for Benvar’s primary school, more than a mile down a red dirt road. She planted herself inside one of the three classrooms that make up the squat, concrete building, where she was one of 70 new pupils squeezed onto benches in a school with more than 300 students. One classroom had blackboards at either end, with half the students listening to one teacher, and the other half facing the opposite direction listening to another. ‘Clever and Polite’ Amid the crush of children, teachers noticed her. “She was unusual -- clever and polite,” recalls Moussa Kiemtore, 34, the school’s headmaster, who sports a clean-shaven head and a small tuft of hair on his chin. Clarisse stood out because she understood and even spoke some French she had learned in Ivory Coast. Though it’s the official language in Burkina Faso -- and the language of instruction in its schools -- very few children in and around Benvar know French, especially the youngest, Kiemtore says. Clarisse was overjoyed. “They showed me many new things,” she says. She wouldn’t stay in school for long. Her seat was empty before she completed a single term. The schoolmaster was alarmed when he heard the French-speaking girl was no longer in class. He visited Kamboule and tried to persuade him to bring her back. School ‘Useless’ “He claimed she left on her own,” the schoolmaster recalls, “but we realized later he had compelled her to leave.” Or as Clarisse puts it, Kamboule “told me going to school was useless.” She wasn’t useless to Kamboule. Like other farmers from across Burkina Faso, he says the cash that neighboring growers fetched for organic and fair-trade cotton persuaded him to plant the fiber. Previously, he had grown millet, mostly to feed his family. For the cotton planted in 2010, organic farmers could net up to 70 percent more per hectare than neighbors using genetically modified seeds, according to data from Helvetas. Kamboule and some growers say nobody from the program gave them rules or training about child labor on their farms. Face- to-face instruction would be a necessity in a nation where 71 percent of the population can’t read. ‘Nothing About Children’ “No, they said nothing about children,” recalled Louis Joseph Kambire, 69, a wiry fair-trade farmer who sits on the audit committee of the Benvar cooperative. Without kids of his own, Kambire forces the foster children in his care to work in an organic and fair-trade cotton field that he’s cultivated right next to Clarisse’s. The children -- 10-year-old Edmond Dieudone and 12-year-old Ponhitierre Some -- make it possible for him to earn a living from fair-trade cotton, says Kambire, wearing a white crucifix on a black cord around his neck and a white fedora with a black band on his head. “That’s why they are working with me,” he says. Before the fair-trade program, he hadn’t made them labor in his subsistence fields. Sometimes, Clarisse spies Edmond and Ponhitierre in the distance, though they keep silent. “We can’t speak when the farmers are there,” she says. Little Training There was little or no effort to increase training after the 2008 report, according to Bloomberg interviews with farmers in five of the six villages where the survey was conducted. Dramane Diabre, a farmer with 13 children in the eastern region of the country, says he received training on avoiding illegal child labor in 2010. By contrast, every farmer in the southwest said there was never any resulting action. Growers across the country say they got regular technical training on how to maintain organic purity following concerns about contamination with the 2008 introduction of genetically modified crops in the country’s conventional cotton sector. The fiber can be scientifically tested for organic purity, not for whether children grow it. Guebre, the head of organic and fair trade for the growers group, says technical sessions included information on child labor. “If someone doesn’t want it, we can’t force him,” says Guebre, whose group keeps a share of the price paid by Victoria’s Secret. “If he says he didn’t participate or didn’t hear, that’s something else.” In response to questions, the growers federation denied that child labor is used in its program. Guebre also says its myriad requirements, including avoiding such labor, are read out to farmers when they initially sign on. Hauling Manure Compost Like others, Baasolokoun “Bassole” Dabire, 53, president of the organic and fair-trade cooperative in the village of Yabogane, didn’t get the message. He said his understanding was that it’s acceptable for his roughly 60 farmers to use children in their fields on two conditions: They’re not their own biological children, and they’re at least six years old. “Your own children, no, but somebody else’s child can work,” he says in an interview near his farm in the southwest. The cotton Clarisse grows comes with two certifications -- one for fair trade and one for organic. Buyers pay the program a premium for each. In the field, the organic designation means she avoids pesticides or mineral fertilizers that can plague children forced to labor in conventional cotton. Yet the lack of chemicals carries its own cost. Two or three times between digging rows and harvesting each season, Clarisse must spend days hauling buckets of manure compost on her head about half a mile to her field from a pit she helps maintain. Bending at her waist, she uses both hands to spread a circle of compost around each of the thousands of plants. Her lower back aches. ‘Very Painful’ “It’s very painful,” Clarisse says, “because I have to keep doing it until he tells me I can stop.” Without herbicides and pesticides, Clarisse must defend the crop against weeds and other invaders -- by hand. One of the cotton farmer’s greatest enemies is the boll worm, which can quickly destroy an entire crop if left unchecked. Clarisse says she walks the rows, delicately reaching into a plant when she spots a worm. Without disturbing their fragile bolls, she extracts each worm with a firm pinch. They can grow as large as her index finger. She throws them onto the ground, flips over her hoe and uses its flat side to crush each one against the gravelly earth. First Harvest By the time Clarisse started picking her first harvest in 2010, Victoria’s Secret was becoming the program’s only buyer instead of just the most prominent, according to Guebre of the growers group and Meier, whose Swiss group advises it. That’s because the country’s overall organic yield was shrinking ever- closer to the 600 metric tons per year guaranteed to the lingerie company. At about 5:40 a.m. on the first day of Clarisse’s harvest this November, the horizon behind her hut starts to glow red, almost purple, while she stirs inside. Just before sunrise, she pushes open the metal door. She places a bucket inside a wicker bushel and tightly folds a faded polypropylene sack until it’s the size of a pocket book, flicking it into the bucket with a snap of her wrist. Without breaking stride, Clarisse raises the bushel with both hands, walks beneath it and balances it on her head. She heads down a path beside a corn field leveled by the harvest, a pair of flip-flops with pink straps popping beneath her feet, her hands resting easily at her sides. All around Clarisse, the earth is like a wasteland. It’s black and charred from clearing fires set by farmers, filling the air with the smell of burning grass, sweet and strong. Row Upon Row She crosses the main village road, the one that leads to Benvar’s school, and steps onto a slender trail winding through dry, golden stalks of grain that rise above her head. After about 50 paces, she emerges to see the work that awaits her: row upon row of bolls bursting with cotton. The farmer is already here, working where the plants are most in danger of being trampled by passersby. At the opposite end stands a tree branch topped by the green flag. By 7:15 a.m., the sliver of shade in the bottom corner of her field disappears, as the West African sun rises with the temperature. On the road above the field, a boy walking to school says he and his friends notice the children working almost every day. “We see them to be suffering,” says Seuka Somda, who, like Clarisse, is 13. Giant Shea Tree The harvesting pauses at about noon, after six hours of picking. Clarisse heads to the village square to cool herself in the shade of a giant shea tree that grows in its center. Before long, a woman calls her name. She jumps to her feet and scurries over. Three men traveling through the village have stopped to cool themselves and drink some of the local brew, called “pito.” As Clarisse fills their bowls, one man tells her: “If you give me a refill, it means you have agreed to sleep with me.” She pours his pito, turns and walks away. Around 4 p.m., Clarisse returns to the field. A large wicker bushel bulges with cotton. She bends over and compacts it as tightly as she can. Cotton towers above the bushel’s rim. Clarisse wobbles as she sets it atop a blue, yellow and red scarf wrapped on the crown of her head. She makes her way along the road under the weight of the harvest, weak from eating nothing for two days except some roasted groundnuts given to her by another child laborer. Two men on bicycles pedal toward her, both carrying bulging bags balanced on their frames. “Have you gone to grind some flour?” she calls out. “Can you kindly give me some so I can make something to eat?” The men say nothing, continuing down the red dirt road toward the village square. Storing the Cotton Clarisse carries her bushel to a neighbor’s home where Kamboule stores his cotton because it’s closer to the pickup point for the organic and fair-trade program. The house, in relative luxury with its poured concrete foundation, sits just down the road from the school she used to attend. Back at Kamboule’s hut, under the light of a full moon, Clarisse says she’ll use some of the water she’s drawn from the well to wash herself, then she’ll go to the homes of neighbors and friends in the village. If they’re eating, she’ll wait politely and hope they offer her some food. For an enfant confie, this is everyday life, Clarisse says: “If your mother is not with you, you become like an orphan.” Far away, in midtown Manhattan, Irina Richardson says she’s shopped at Victoria’s Secret for bras and underwear for 15 years and was pleased to think she was doing good. Told of Clarisse’s role in providing cotton for lingerie, the 51-year-old property manager from Long Island says she was stunned. “Buying something made under those conditions shows no respect for other human beings,” she says. No More French Clarisse, who once stared at the world in wonder, now has difficulty looking others in the face. She no longer speaks French, because, she says, there is no one left in her life who would understand her. Exhausted at the end of each day, she can’t fall asleep easily after she lies down on her faded plastic mat. “I feel uneasy,” she says. “Sometimes, I’m very angry.” It’s hard to close her eyes, she says, when she knows waking up means “I will suffer again.” She tries to think of a better life: She imagines owning and tending a few sheep and some goats. Women can earn money raising small animals, and it’s easier than working the fields. This is her new dream now that she knows, as she says, that “I have no chance to go back to school.” Once she does fall asleep, the nightmares return.

These claims arose in a Bloomberg report, which mentioned a 13-year-old girl, forced to work in a cotton field in Burkina Faso. The cotton from that field was then used in Victoria's Secret products. Parent company Limited Brands expressed concern about the allegations and vowed a full investigation. They stated that if the allegations were true, it would be a violation of their company's values and sourcing standards. The cotton in question was grown in West Africa and was supposed to be organic and fair trade, meaning it should've been free of child and forced labor practices. The lucrative premiums paid for organic and fair-trade cotton created new incentives for exploitation, attracting subsistence farmers who reportedly couldn't grow fair-trade cotton without violating the children's rights. Victoria's Secret agreed to buy fair-trade and organic cotton from Burkina Faso in 2007 to promote sustainable raw materials and benefit female African farmers. However, it seemed that little training or safeguards against using children were provided. As a result of these allegations, Fairtrade International began a review of the situation in Burkina Faso and initiated a training program for farmers."},{"question":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

This single/multi-select question provides a statement to analyze and a claim to compare it against. The statement given is: \\"A young girl in a pink dress with something in her hand.\\" The claim that we must evaluate against this statement is: \\"A girl is throwing a stone.\\" In order to determine if the claim can be concluded based on the information provided in the statement, we will break down each component and compare them. First, let us examine the subject: \\"A young girl\\". Both the statement and the claim are referring to a girl, which is consistent, although the statement specifies that she is young while the claim does not include this detail. However, age does not seem to be a crucial factor here, so we can continue to the next component. The next part is the girl's attire: \\"in a pink dress.\\" This detail is not mentioned in the claim, but again, it is not necessarily a crucial factor, so we will proceed to the next component. The third element of the statement is that she has \\"something in her hand.\\" This is a vague and uncertain detail, as \\"something\\" could be anything from a small toy to a piece of fruit. Since we do not know what the girl is holding, it is difficult to determine whether the claim is accurate. Now let us examine the action described in the claim: \\"throwing a stone.\\" This is where we run into a discrepancy. The statement only mentions that there is something in the girl's hand, but there is no mention of her throwing this object, nor is it specified that the object is a stone. Based on the information provided in the statement, we cannot accurately conclude that \\"A girl is throwing a stone.\\" The claim includes details that are not present or confirmed in the statement, particularly the action of throwing an object and the specific object being a stone.

Q: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown origin. Determining the involvement and the response to the treatment is important. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of methylprednisolone and indomethacine on metabolic activity and pulmonary function test parameters in patients with sarcoidosis.', 'A total of 24 pulmonary sarcoidosis patients were enrolled in the study. All the patients underwent spirometry and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) scan before treatment and were divided into two groups according to the necessity of corticosteroid treatment or not. Patients who did not have corticosteroid indication were treated with indomethacine. Symptomatic patients and patients who did not respond to indomethacine treatment received methylprednisolone. Patients were followed up on a monthly basis to determine the response. FDG uptakes as the disease activity were re-evaluated before ending the treatment at the sixth month.', 'Mean age of patients (16 male, 8 female) was 39.79 (9.3) years.

Synovial fluid is a lubricant for which parts of the body?","response":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: 1. Recall the definition and functions of synovial fluid. 2. Identify the parts of the body where synovial fluid is located. Step 1: Synovial fluid is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints. It has the primary function of reducing friction between the articular cartilage of synovial joints during movement. Synovial fluid also provides nutrients and removes waste products from the joint, maintaining joint health. Step 2: Synovial fluid is located in the synovial joints, which are the most common and most movable type of joint in the body. Examples of synovial joints include the following: - Hinge joints, such as elbow and knee joints - Ball-and-socket joints, such as shoulder and hip joints - Pivot joints, such as the atlantoaxial joint in the neck - Saddle joints, such as the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb - Gliding or plane joints, such as those found in the wrist and ankle - Condyloid or ellipsoid joints, such as the radiocarpal joint in the wrist In conclusion, synovial fluid serves as a lubricant for synovial joints, which are present in various parts of the body such as the elbows, knees, shoulders, hips, neck, wrist, ankle, and thumb."},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: 35th Street runs from FDR Drive to Eleventh Avenue.

I have always been fascinated by his approach to fighting, but now --after reading \\"Artist of Life\\" -- I have a much deeper respect for him as a human being. Talk about being a \\"complete\\" person; this book reveals Bruce Lee to be a Chinese martial art historian, a philosopher of both eastern and western thought, a poet of great depth and sensitivity, a martial art pioneer, and his essays on self-knowledge are absolutely compelling. Bruce Lee has revealed to me many areas of development that we all need to look at in order to become a \\"total\\" person.

A:","response":"The last step of the process would be to regularly care for and monitor the growth of your newly planted seeds. This involves the following tasks: 1. Watering: Ensure the soil remains consistently moist, especially during the germination period (this duration will vary depending on the specific plant species). Be careful not to overwater, as this could lead to potential complications such as root rot or fungi growth. Monitor the soil and adjust watering frequency based on factors such as rainfall, temperatures, and the specific plant's water requirements. 2. Fertilizing: As the plants start to grow, they may require additional nutrients to support their development. Research the specific nutritional needs of the plant, and apply a slow-release fertilizer or organic compost accordingly. Be sure to follow the recommended guidelines for application rates and frequencies, as over-fertilization can cause harm to the plants. 3. Providing support: Some plants may require additional support structures as they grow, such as stakes, trellises, or cages. These structures prevent the plants from collapsing under their own weight and can aid in healthier growth by providing better air circulation, sun exposure, and access to nutrients. 4. Pruning and thinning: Regularly remove any dead or damaged leaves, branches, and flowers to maintain the plant's overall health and promote better shape and growth. Thinning involves selectively removing some plants or branches to promote better airflow, prevent overcrowding, and ensure all plants have access to the necessary nutrients, light, and space to grow. 5. Pest and disease control: Routinely inspect your plants for signs of pest infestations or diseases. Early detection and treatment of these issues can help prevent more severe problems from arising. Utilize appropriate methods to maintain plant health and consider using organic or environmentally-friendly options. 6. Harvesting: When the plant reaches maturity, and fruits, vegetables, or flowers have adequately developed, it's time to harvest your yield. Research the specific harvesting techniques and guidelines for your plant type and pick the produce at its peak ripeness for the best flavor and nutritional content. 7. Record-keeping: Throughout the entire process, it's crucial to keep track of your plants' progress, challenges, and growth patterns. Keeping a gardening journal will not only enable you to learn from your observations but also help you improve your gardening skills and increase your chances of a more successful harvest in future growing seasons."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given two pieces of text with the same meaning.

Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side, has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude. Which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena? A:","response":"To determine which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena, let's analyze the given information step-by-step: 1. Burr Township: - Situated on the western side of the ridge - At a lower altitude - Experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while 2. Jolt Township: - Situated on the eastern side - At a higher altitude - Less windy, less cloudy environment Now, let's consider how the differences between the two townships might affect atmospheric convection: - Higher altitude generally leads to cooler temperatures and potentially more stable atmospheric conditions. This reduces instability in the air and can result in less frequent convection events. - While Burr township is at a lower altitude (which generally means warmer temperatures), it is also situated on the western side of the ridge, where it might experience more wind, mixing up air masses and potentially leading to more instability in the atmosphere. This would result in more frequent convection events. Based on these factors, it appears that Jolt Township, with its higher altitude and less windy, less cloudy environment, is likely experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena in comparison to Burr Township."},{"question":"The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920, but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Clement Greenberg. Contemporary views of Cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the \\"Salle 41\\" Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them. Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the \\"Salle 41\\" artists, e.g., Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or (or the Puteaux Group); the sculptors Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis, Roger de La Fresnaye, František Kupka, Diego Rivera, Léopold Survage, Auguste Herbin, André Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916), María Blanchard (after 1916) and Georges Valmier (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were \\"later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation.\\" Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who was the main opponent that began to agree that the flat canvas did not support Cubism?","response":"The question is somewhat unclear, but based on the information provided, it seems that Clement Greenberg criticized the assertion by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supported the flatness of the canvas. Greenberg's criticism occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, so it can be inferred that Greenberg is the main opponent who disagreed with the idea that flat canvas supported Cubism.

According to a report on news site Bikyamasr picked up by USA Today, women whose eyes are deemed “tempting” or sexy can be ordered to cover them. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in Saudi Arabia made the decree after a man was reportedly hospitalized after a fight with a committee member who told his wife to cover her eyes. Expand this summary.","response":"In Saudi Arabia, women are subject to strict dress codes as part of the country's adherence to a conservative interpretation of Islamic law. The dress code dictates that women should cover most of their bodies, hair, and faces, often by wearing an abaya, hijab, and niqab. However, a recent development suggests that Saudi women may now be required to cover their eyes as well, particularly if their eyes are considered to be \\"tempting\\" or attractive. This decision has been made by the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in Saudi Arabia, a group that is responsible for ensuring that people in the country adhere to Islamic codes of behavior, such as dressing modestly. This primarily involves enforcing the moral codes set out by religious teachings, preventing any actions that are seen as sinful or contradictory to the tenets of Islam. According to a report published on the news site Bikyamasr, which was picked up by USA Today, the incident that prompted this decree involved a Saudi man who was hospitalized after getting into a fight with a member of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The altercation began when the committee member ordered the man's wife to cover her eyes, which were deemed to be too appealing. The notion that a woman can be ordered to cover her eyes if they are deemed attractive brings up several questions and concerns. Firstly, the subjectivity of what is considered to be \\"tempting\\" or attractive varies greatly between individuals, which could lead to inconsistencies in how the rule is enforced. Additionally, it raises issues regarding personal freedom and rights for women in the country. This potential requirement is yet another example of the strict control that is exerted over women in Saudi Arabia and the limitations placed on their autonomy. Women in the country have only recently obtained the right to drive, and male guardians still have significant control over their movements, work, and personal decisions. The international community has taken notice of the situation in the country, with human rights organizations expressing concern about the treatment of women and their rights. Critics argue that these restrictions not only violate basic human rights but also limit the ability of women to contribute to their country's development. It remains to be seen whether the decree to cover women's eyes will be strictly enforced, but, if implemented, it demonstrates the continuing gender inequality and the control over women's lives within Saudi Arabia. As the country modernizes and aims to improve its global reputation, addressing these issues of women's rights and promoting equality will be crucial for achieving progress and inclusivity in the nation."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - John Nichols Dalton ( July 11 , 1931 -- July 30 , 1986 ) was the 63rd Governor of the U.S. state of Virginia , serving from 1978 to 1982 . Dalton won the office with 55.9 % of the vote , defeating Democrat Henry E. Howell , Jr and Independent Alan R. Ogden . Dalton had previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia . - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Ralph Shearer Northam (born September 13, 1959) is an American physician and politician, currently serving as the 40th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. On November 5, 2013, Northam became the first Democrat since Tim Kaine in 2001 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, defeating the Republican nominee, E.W. Jackson. - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - The Lieutenant Governor is a constitutional officer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Lieutenant Governor is elected every four years along with the Governor and Attorney General. The office is currently held by Democrat Ralph Northam. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately and thus may be of different political parties. The lieutenant governor's office is located in the Oliver Hill Building on Capitol Square in Richmond, Virginia. The lieutenant governor serves as the President of the Senate of Virginia and is first in the line of succession to the governor; in the event the governor dies, resigns, or otherwise leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Unlike the governor, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia can run for re-election. - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction, but is often the deputy or lieutenant to or ranking under a governor a \\"second-in-command\\". A notable exception to this would be in Canada and a few other Commonwealth realms, in which the lieutenant governor is the representative of the monarch in that jurisdiction. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. It is the center of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Greater Richmond Region. It was incorporated in 1742, and has been an independent city since 1871. - The Senate of Virginia is the upper house of the Virginia General Assembly. The Senate is composed of 40 Senators representing an equal number of single-member constituent districts. The Senate is presided over by the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Prior to the American War of Independence, the upper house of the General Assembly was represented by the Virginia Governor's Council, consisting of up to 12 executive counselors appointed by the Colonial Royal Governor as advisers and jurists.

At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he is introduced to Sofia Serrano (PenÃ©lope Cruz) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) at a party. David and Sofia spend a night together talking and fall in love. When David's former lover, Julianna \\"Julie\\" Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she attempts to kill herself and David in a car crash. Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely disfigured,[4] leading him to wear a mask to hide the injuries.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Given the question \\"How would parents feel as a result?\\", is \\"just a little irritated\\" a valid answer?","response":"Yes, \\"just a little irritated\\" can be a valid answer to the question \\"How would parents feel as a result?\\" However, it is important to note that people's emotional reactions can vary greatly depending on their personalities, sense of humor, the nature of the prank, and their relationship with the prankster. In this case, since it is a tradition for Kai to play a prank on their parents on the first of April (April Fools' Day), it is likely that the parents are somewhat accustomed to this playful behavior and might not get too upset. Therefore, feeling \\"just a little irritated\\" could be an accurate description of their emotional reaction. They could also find it amusing or not be bothered by it at all, as long as the prank is harmless and in good taste.

Generally seen as the main variety of local fascism, and noted for its Romanian Orthodox-inspired revolutionary message, the Iron Guard grew into an important actor on the Romanian political stage, coming into conflict with the political establishment and democratic forces, and often resorted to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as Capitanul (\\"The Captain\\"), and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death. Codreanu, who began his career in the wake of World War I as an anticommunist and antisemitic agitator associated with A. C. Cuza and Constantin Pancu, was a co-founder of the National-Christian Defense League and assassin of the Iasi Police prefect Constantin Manciu. Codreanu felt he had to amend the purpose of the movement after more than two years of stagnation: he and the leadership of the movement started touring rural regions, addressing the churchgoing illiterate population with the rhetoric of sermons, dressing up in long white mantles and instigating Christian prejudice against Judaism (this intense campaign was also prompted by the fact that the Legion was immediately sidelined by Cuza's League in the traditional Moldavian and Bukovinan centers). Between 1928 and 1930, the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod National Peasants' Party cabinet gave tacit assistance to the Guard, but Iuliu Maniu (representing the same party) clamped down on the Legion after July 1930. This came after the latter had tried to provoke a wave of pogroms in Maramures and Bessarabia. In one notable incident of 1930, Legionaries encouraged the peasant population of Borsa to attack the town's 4,000 Jews. The Legion had also attempted to assassinate government officials and journalists -- including Constantin Angelescu, undersecretary of Internal Affairs. Codreanu was briefly arrested together with the would-be assassin Gheorghe Beza: both were tried and acquitted. Nevertheless, the wave of violence and a planned march into Bessarabia signalled the outlawing of the party by Premier Gheorghe Mironescu and Minister of the Interior Ion Mihalache (January 1931); again arrested, Codreanu was acquitted in late February. Having been boosted by the Great Depression and the malcontent it engendered, in 1931, the Legion also profited from the disagreement between King Carol II and the National Peasants' Party, which brought a cabinet formed around Nicolae Iorga. Codreanu was consequently elected to Chamber of Deputies on the lists of the Corneliu Zelea Codreanu Grouping (the provisional name for the Guard), together with other prominent members of his original movement -- including Ion Zelea, his father, and Mihai Stelescu, a young activist who ultimately came into conflict with the Legion; it is likely that the new Vaida-Voevod cabinet gave tacit support to the Group in subsequent partial elections. The Legion had won five seats in all, which was its first important electoral gain. He quickly became noted for exposing corruption of ministers and other politicians on a case-by-case basis (although several of his political adversaries at the time described him as bland and incompetent).

What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I will help you analyze the questions and provide information to help you form your own opinion. 1. Is Hillary Clinton trustworthy? This is a general question asking to evaluate the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. In order to address this question, one might consider her political career, achievements, controversies, and how she has handled various situations. Steps to answer this question (keeping in mind that I don't have a personal opinion): - Examine her political career and positions held. - Analyze her accomplishments and voting record. - Review controversies associated with her, such as her use of a private email server or the Benghazi incident. - Look into her past statements and see if there's a pattern of honesty or dishonesty. - Consider her overall reputation and the opinions of others. 2. Is Hillary Clinton still trustworthy based on her history of statements? This question is more specific, requesting to evaluate her trustworthiness based on her history of statements. The focus here is on her past statements and how consistent or inconsistent they have been over time. Steps to answer this question (keeping in mind that I don't have a personal opinion): - Collect a sample of her past statements on various issues. - Check the consistency of her statements over time. - Research any instances when her statements or positions have changed and the context for these changes. - Determine if the changes in statements were justified or if they indicated dishonesty. - Consider other factors (e.g., political context, pressures, etc.) that may have influenced these statements. Are these questions the same? While both questions are related to Hillary Clinton's trustworthiness, they are not the same.

The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines. During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC. In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did anything happen in AD?","response":"Yes, according to the quote from the article: \\"The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.\\" This indicates that during the 1st century AD, there was a significant event that led to the collapse of the Late Preclassic cultural florescence and the abandonment of many great Maya cities.

Burger King Brand proposed on Monday, and Joel Burger and Ashley King accepted. The company is paying the expenses and providing gifts for the July 17 wedding of Joel and Ashley in Jacksonville, aka the Burger-King nuptials. Friday's column was about how Joel and Ashley have been Burger-King since they were in the fifth grade together in New Berlin. When they announced their engagement this spring, they had their picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. They flipped their names so that Joel's would be first in the announcement. Normally the woman's name is first. But then it wouldn't have been Burger-King, would it? Friday's column was pretty well-read locally. And then it went viral. The New York Daily News posted it. The Huffington Post reposted it. Soon I was hearing from BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail in the U.K. and a producer from Australia’s #1 Radio Show, which happens to be The Kyle and Jackie O Show. (But, then, you knew that.) They all wanted to contact Joel and Ashley. The media crush is threatening to become overwhelming. It will only gain momentum now that Burger King is on board and will be promoting the Burger King, Burger-King connection nationally. I hope it stays fun for Joel and Ashley. \\"Oh my God, it's going to be crazy,\\" Ashley said. She knew over the weekend that the column had gone viral. She said, sure, they'll talk with Australia's number one radio show. I expect more will be calling. > UPDATE (April 8, 10:15 a.m.): Burger King has released a video about the couple on YouTube: This all began innocently enough with SJ-R business editor Tim Landis.

For my part, all I had to do was recognize it as one. Since Ashley had already tried to reach out to the Burger King company, but unsuccessfully, I sent an email to the company's media relations representative. I soon heard from Alison Brod Public Relations in New York City, the company that has the Burger King account. I sent them an email about the wedding, they contacted the company, and Burger King took it from there. Which culminated Monday afternoon when Joel and Ashley got the big news from Burger King via Skype. The connection was between New Berlin and New York City and we can't say that very often, can we? Ashley's dad, Vince King, was there to help celebrate, as was Joel's mom, Cindy Burger. \\"When we heard about the happy, Burger-King couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage,\\" said Eric Hirschhorn, Burger King Brand spokesman. \\"On so many levels it felt like fate; they found each other and their story found us.\\" The company, as we say in the newspaper business \\"buried the lede\\" when giving Joel and Ashley the news Monday afternoon. Burger King didn't tell them they were picking up the tab for the wedding until near the end. It was a huge surprise. \\"We were just blown away,\\" Joel said. \\"We were shaking,\\" Ashley added. Shaking and blown away and crying, but in a good way. Since Friday's column described how the Burger-King name was given Joel and Ashley by a motivational speaker who used yo-yos at a fifth-grade assembly, the Burger King company is providing personalized yo-yos to the wedding guests. The company also is providing gift bags, Mason Jars and Burger King crowns, all personalized for Joel and Ashley's wedding. But paying for the entire thing is huge. \\"We knew deep in our hearts that we wanted to honor the union of Mr. Burger and Ms. King,\\" says Hirschhorn. \\"In an unforgettable way. Everyone at Burger King Brand agreed and, as Dave Bakke said, we knew we wanted to create a 'whopper of a wedding' that's uniquely their own. \\"And now we hope we've swept them off their feet. All we ask in return is that they live happily ever after.\\" And that's the way we like it: Well done. — Contact Dave Bakke: dave.bakke@sj-r.com, 788-1541, twitter.com/DaveBakkeSJR. *** ||||| This story was updated on Tuesday, April 7, 2015.

Heather Mack, the pregnant teenager on trial in Bali charged with murdering her mother, was rushed to hospital from her prison today. Sources inside Kerobokan Jail told the Daily Mail Online the 19-year-old prisoner had collapsed with stomach pain and had started bleeding. According to a prison source, Miss Mack cried out in pain at lunch time and after a check by the prison doctor it was decided she needed immediate hospital treatment. She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated. Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood. They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and","response":"then proceeded to physically assault him, at which point he retaliated in self-defense. Overwhelmed by the intensity of the situation, Heather and Tommy panicked and made the horrifying choice to stuff Sheila's body into a suitcase and attempt to conceal their crime. Heather and Tommy's actions were soon discovered when the hotel staff noticed blood seeping from the suitcase. The police were alerted immediately, and security footage captured the couple attempting to dispose of the body. Both Heather and Tommy were apprehended and later charged with premeditated murder. The trial was nothing short of a spectacle, drawing international attention as the couple maintained their innocence despite the mounting evidence against them. Heather's pregnancy only adding to the intrigue of the case, creating an extra layer of tension and concern for her unborn child. During the trial, witnesses gave their testimonies, and the prosecution presented the evidence, building a strong case against Heather and Tommy. In the end, both were found guilty of the brutal murder of Heather's mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack. Heather Mack was sentenced to ten years in prison, while her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, received an 18-year sentence for his role in the murder. Their Indonesian-born child, Stella, was allowed to live with her mother in Kerobokan Jail for the first few years of her life before being placed in the care of a local Balinese family. The couple was also ordered to pay restitution to Sheila's estate. Throughout their time in prison, Heather and Tommy were occasionally permitted to see their daughter, but their relationship became more and more strained. Tommy opted to focus on his education and began teaching English classes within the prison, seeking redemption and a chance at a better future upon his eventual release. After serving seven years of her sentence, Heather filed an appeal for a reduced sentence, expressing remorse and sorrow for her actions. The judge granted her request, acknowledging Heather's good behavior during her time behind bars and her attempts to turn her life around. Heather was released from prison in 2021, after serving only seven years of her original 10-year sentence. Upon her release, Heather sought to reclaim custody of her daughter, Stella, now seven years old, and return to the United States to start a new life. The adoptive Balinese family initially resisted, having formed a strong bond with the young girl, but eventually, after a long and emotional legal battle, Heather was granted full custody of Stella. Heather and Stella moved back to the United States and settled into a quiet life, striving to heal from the tragic events that had transpired in Bali. Although plagued by the weight of her past, Heather vowed to provide her daughter with the love and support she needed to grow up strong and resilient, just as her late mother had done for her. Meanwhile, Tommy continued to serve his sentence in Kerobokan Jail, focusing on his education and rehabilitation efforts. Having been deeply affected by the loss of Sheila and the chaos his actions had caused, he swore to honor her memory by dedicating his life to making amends and working towards a brighter future. As the years passed, Stella grew into a bright and compassionate young woman. While she would never forget the devastating circumstances of her birth and her mother's crime, she chose to rise above the darkness, empowered and inspired by the boundless love and support of her mother, Heather. And as they both continued down the path of redemption and healing, they remained forever bound by the unshakable bond between mother and daughter, tied together by the mistakes of the past, the love they shared, and the hope for a better tomorrow."},{"question":"Does the word \\"business\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? We do business all over the world. Computers are now widely used in business.","response":"Although the word \\"business\\" is used in both of these sentences, it can be interpreted differently depending on the context. In the first sentence, \\"We do business all over the world,\\" the word \\"business\\" refers to the act of engaging in commerce, trade, or economic activities between different individuals, corporations or governments, across different regions and countries. In this context, the term \\"business\\" is more about the transactions, deals, and activities that are conducted or carried out in the pursuit of profit, market access, or other economic goals. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"Computers are now widely used in business,\\" the word \\"business\\" is used in a broader sense, referring to the entire field of activity wherein professionals, corporations, or organizations operate, manage, and strategize with the aim of generating profits or providing goods and services to others. In this context, the term \\"business\\" encompasses a wide range of industries, sectors, and functions, such as finance, manufacturing, healthcare, technology, marketing, and more. Furthermore, the focus in this sentence is on the integration and utilization of computers and technology within the framework of various business operations, systems, and processes. To sum up, the first sentence highlights \\"business\\" as the act of commerce and trade across the world, while the second sentence refers to \\"business\\" as the general field of industry and professional activity where computers are now an essential tool. Despite being used in different contexts, both meanings are interconnected, as they underscore the functions, operations, and relationships inherent in the economic world. In conclusion, although the word \\"business\\" is present in both sentences, the definition varies depending on the context. The first sentence focuses on the global aspect of engaging in trade and commerce, while the second one emphasizes the integration of computers within a wide range of industries and professional activities. Nevertheless, both meanings are related, highlighting the dynamic nature of economic activities and the importance of technological advancements."},{"question":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein,\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\"? , can you please find it? Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. At the conclusion of the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the... Answer:","response":"The name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\" is \\"Let It Be.\\" The Beatles' final album release was recorded during a tumultuous period for the band members, marked by tension and disagreements. This challenging time eventually led to Harrison's brief departure and the decision to abandon talk of live performances. The album, initially titled \\"Get Back,\\" evolved into \\"Let It Be,\\" which was comprised of songs recorded for the TV special. Glyn Johns was tasked with assembling the album, effectively giving him \\"free rein\\" to finalize the project, as the band members were significantly less involved at that point."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: While SG1 attends the extraction ceremony of of the last ga'ul Ba'al, an ominous warning is issued.

John Ashton of Cowhill and Thomas Buckley of Baretrees in Chadderton were two victims of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Samuel Collins, 'The Bard Of Hale Moss', was a 19th-century poet and radical who lived at Hale Moss in southern Chadderton.Lydia Becker was a pioneer in the late 19th century of the campaign for Women's Suffrage and founder of the Women's Suffrage Journal, born in Chadderton's Foxdenton Hall. Chadderton born scientist Geoff Tootill helped create the Manchester Baby in 1948, the world's first electronic stored-program computer.

So at this point we really want to nix her services and do it ourselves with the help of everyone who has offered . This will save us the 250 , but we 're in a pickle trying to figure out how or when we would prepare everything . Answer the following question: Why might they be considered in a pickle ?","response":"The phrase \\"in a pickle\\" means to be in a difficult or tricky situation. In the context given, there are a few reasons why they might be considered in a pickle. Firstly, they are planning their wedding to be just three days after Christmas. This time of the year is generally quite busy with holiday preparations and celebrations, so adding in a wedding can complicate things. If the couple is not careful, they could end up overstressed and not able to fully enjoy their wedding. Secondly, their wedding venue is in a small town where the bride, groom, bridal party, and family members are all staying. This can potentially put a lot of pressure on the couple, as everyone would be in the same location, potentially needing assistance or having questions. Any issues that arise would likely need to be dealt with quickly and efficiently, as there would not be a significant buffer of distance to aid in managing them. Thirdly, they are considering nixing their wedding services, which presumably might include catering, and handling the preparation themselves instead. This is a large undertaking that involves a lot of work, from cooking and setting up to cleaning up afterward. Managing this alongside the wedding preparations might seem overwhelming, hence making their situation a pickle. Lastly, they are motivated by the desire to save money which, while understandable, might not be the wisest move in terms of preserving their peace of mind. The 250 they'd save by doing things themselves rather than hiring professionals could potentially be outweighed by the stress of handling everything, especially if unexpected issues crop up. In conclusion, the couple is in a pickle because they find themselves needing to navigate a tricky balancing act between preserving their sanity, maintaining their budget, and ensuring their wedding goes off without a hitch. To do this, they will require careful planning, efficient time management and potentially, the assistance of their bridal party and family members. Therefore, these numerous challenges and considerations are what make their current predicament described as being \\"in a pickle\\"."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. Given the sentence \\"Two men are sitting back to back in chairs with one talking on a telephone.\\" is it true that \\"Bob was on the phone while tom was sitting in the chair behind him.\\"?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the given sentence The given sentence is \\"Two men are sitting back to back in chairs with one talking on a telephone.\\" Step 2: Identify key information from the sentence From this sentence, we can gather the following information: - There are two men. - They are sitting back to back in chairs. - One of the men is talking on a telephone. Step 3: Analyze the proposed statement The proposed statement is \\"Bob was on the phone while Tom was sitting in the chair behind him.\\" Step 4: Identify key information from the proposed statement From this statement, we can gather the following information: - One of the men's name is Bob, who is on the phone. - The other man's name is Tom, who is sitting in the chair behind Bob. Step 5: Compare the key information from both sources From the given sentence, we know that there are two men sitting back to back with one talking on the phone. In the proposed statement, we know that Bob is on the phone and Tom is sitting behind him. So, the situation seems to be consistent with the sentence. Step 6: Verify if the names are given in the original sentence The given sentence does not provide any names for the two men and doesn't explicitly mention that Bob is on the phone or that Tom is sitting behind him. The names Bob and Tom are introduced in the proposed statement without any reference in the original sentence. Step 7: Conclusion Despite the consistency in the situation described in both the sentence and the statement, the names of the men are not given in the original sentence. Therefore, we can't definitively say that the proposed statement \\"Bob was on the phone while Tom was sitting in the chair behind him.\\" is true based on the given sentence."},{"question":"Given the below context: FBI agent Malcolm Turner is elated to learn that his stepson, Trent Pierce, has been accepted to attend Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Choose your answer: based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Adam Podlesh was not born in 2011.\\"? Options: [+] Yes. [+] It's impossible to say. [+] No. I think the answer is","response":"Yes. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Adam Podlesh participated in an NFL football game against the St. Louis Rams in Chicago on Sunday, Sept. 23, 2012. Additionally, it is noted that Podlesh was a standout player at Pittsford before going on to punt for the University of Maryland and in the NFL. Considering this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Adam Podlesh was not born in 2011. It would not be feasible for someone born in 2011 to have played in the NFL in 2012, considering the timeline and the required age and athletic abilities to participate in professional football leagues. Furthermore, the mentioned history of playing at Pittsford and the University of Maryland strongly suggests that Podlesh was born well before 2011.

The stretch of Roland Avenue where the incident occurred, near the Bellemore Road intersection, is wide – with two traffic lanes and a bike lane in each direction and a grassy median between them. The road surface is relatively smooth and there is no road reconstruction taking place here, as there is further south on Roland. But in a way, that’s the harsh message of this most recent bicyclist fatality, said Gore’s husband Joe Traill: that cyclists’ safety depends on something even tougher to fix than laws and bike infrastructure – motorists’ behavior. “If everyone was riding the speed limit, it shouldn’t matter the condition of the roadway,” Traill said, his face red with emotion. “If everyone was respecting the three-foot-law, it shouldn’t matter the condition of the roadway,” he said. “If everyone was following the law about not texting while they drive, it shouldn’t matter the condition of the roadway.” “It’s the same message we’ve always had, we just have to say it louder,” Traill said. Gore explained that their shop in Mount Washington is nearby on Falls Road (right down hilly Bellemore) and that the initial report of an unnamed 41-year-old male cyclist struck a particular chill when she heard it yesterday: “that describes a large number of our customers.” Motorist Left the Scene According to Baltimore Police spokesman Det. Jeremy Silbert, “officers were called to the 5700 block of Roland Avenue for a report of a car accident” that took place at about 2:37 pm Saturday. When police arrived, Palermo was still alive and was taken to Sinai Hospital, where he died from his injuries. The motorist, meanwhile, had fled the scene and returned only after she was reportedly chased down by other cyclists. Police described the driver as a 58-year-old woman who had been heading south on Roland Avenue. They said the decision about whether to charge her would be made after consulting with the city state’s attorney’s office. (In an odd coincidence, CBS NFL writer Jason LaCanfora, who happened upon the scene and gave an account of it, had his own experience with drivers leaving an accident scene when his wife was injured by a hit-and-run driver while jogging.) Gore, Traill and other cyclists who saw online photos of the deeply indented and smashed windshield of the Subaru wagon involved in the crash, said it spoke volumes and left them with little sympathy for the motorist who initially fled. “There’s no way you could not know you’d hit somebody,” Gore said. “He was alive after it happened. She might have been able to help or call for help if she’d stayed on the scene,” said Lora Peters, who was walking by, looking for the spot where the fatal bike crash occurred. Hearing about it yesterday had left her deeply disturbed, Peters said. “I would have been on my bike this morning but I had a kind of panic attack about it,” she said, recalling her own collision with a car two-and-a-half years ago. She said she narrowly avoided being struck when the vehicle made a left turn right across her path. Instead she crashed into the side of the car. She noted that the incident occurred not in a congested, busy or poorly designed streetscape but in a quiet nearby residential neighborhood – “it was just right over there in Homeland.” Yelled at and Worse Other bicyclists who stopped to pay their respects had their own tales to tell about encounters with impatient and hostile motorists. “I’ve been yelled at and egged. Yesterday, I had somebody throw cigarettes at me,” said Scott McNary. “Mostly this happens up in the county.” McNary and companions Bob Compton, Phil Kennedy and Ethan McNary made a point of stopping at the crash scene on their way back from a ride to downtown. With police still investigating Saturday’s crash, many who came to pay their respects yesterday noted that Palermo had a business, building bike frames and was an experienced cyclist. “I’m sure he was minding his own business in the bike lane, right where he was supposed to be” said Howard Simon, of Remington, who said he rides on Roland Avenue frequently. Others ran through the list of fatal crashes claiming cyclists’ lives in recent years (including John R. “Jack” Yates on Maryland Avenue in 2009 and Nathan Krasnopoler on West University Parkway in 2011) and urged prosecutors to hold drivers accountable. Meanwhile, the bicycle advocacy group, Bikemore released this statement. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Tom Palermo, who was killed while riding his bicycle on Roland Avenue. Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore. While details of the crash are still emerging, we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene, leaving Tom to die on the street. It is clear that dedicated bicycle lanes were not enough to keep even an experienced bicycle rider safe. Bikemore urges the justice system to hold the driver who killed Tom accountable for her actions. Bikemore will continue to advocate for Baltimore to follow the lead of other major cities and build physically-separated bicycle infrastructure to protect the growing number of people who ride bicycles for transportation and recreation. Roland Park residents and Bikemore asked the city to improve the Roland Avenue bicycle facilities during the resurfacing project that is currently underway. Traffic-separated bicycle lanes could have prevented a crash like this. Unfortunately, these requests were ignored in favor of maintaining vehicular traffic speeds, speeds which likely contributed to Tom’s death.” Not everyone who came to pay respects yesterday was a cyclist. A woman walked over from the nearby apartments and held up three small pots of poinsettias. “Would it be appropriate for me to leave these?” she asked the four bike riders. They told her it was, and thanked her. “It’s just horrible, what happened,” she said ||||| The Episcopal Diocese of Maryland on Sunday identified the driver in a fatal bicycle crash Saturday in North Roland Park as its second-ranking official, Bishop Suffragan Heather Elizabeth Cook. Bishop Eugene Taylor Sutton sent an email Sunday to clergy members with information about the crash. Police said 41-year-old Thomas Palermo was killed. Witnesses and a spokesman for the Police Department said the 58-year-old woman driving the car left the scene of the crash in the 5700 block of Roland Ave. shortly before returning. Sutton's email was provided Sunday night to The Sun by diocese spokeswoman Sharon Tillman. Baltimore police said no charges have been filed and declined to comment on the driver's identity. Police referred questions to the office of the state's attorney, which could not immediately be reached. Attorney David Irwin confirmed that he was representing Cook but said it was too soon for him to offer any comment on her behalf. \\"We're still evaluating,\\" he said. \\"Several news agencies have reported this as a 'hit and run.'

The driver of the vehicle — a 58-year-old woman — initially left but returned while investigators were still on the scene, said Det. Jeremy Silbert, a department spokesman. She was being interviewed by police, said Silbert. The crash occurred in the 5700 block of Roland Ave. at about 2:40 p.m. Detectives believe a Subaru station wagon was traveling southbound when it struck the bicyclist. Silbert said police would confer with prosecutors about whether charges would be filed. Police later identified the victim as Thomas Palermo. Jason La Canfora, the CBS reporter who covers the NFL and who lives in the area, said he saw the badly injured victim on the side of the road and stopped to call 911.

The local bicycle community gathered at the spot to pay their respects and share their personal experiences with road accidents involving cyclists and motorists. The location of the accident is known to be a bike-friendly area, with wide roads, a grassy median, and clearly marked bike lanes. The main concern after this incident is not just the physical infrastructure for cyclists, but also the behavior of motorists. Many cyclists shared their thoughts on the importance of drivers respecting speed limits, the three-foot-law (which requires motorists to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a cyclist), and not texting while driving. They believe that if motorists follow these rules and are more attentive to cyclists, there would be a significant improvement in road safety. The motorist involved in the accident initially fled the scene but later returned after being chased down by other cyclists. The police described her as a 58-year-old woman. The decision to charge her would be made after consultation with the city state's attorney's office. Various cyclists recalled their own experiences with accidents and hostile motorists during their rides. Some of them had been yelled at, egged, or had objects thrown at them, raising concerns about the general attitude of drivers towards cyclists. Bikemore, a bicycle advocacy group, released a statement expressing sympathy for Thomas Palermo's family and friends and urging the justice system to hold the driver accountable for her actions.

An electron with an increased energy level will have energy that is lower or higher? Answer:","response":"An electron with an increased energy level will have higher energy. The electron energy levels, or shells, are like steps on a staircase. The farther away from the nucleus, or the higher the shell, the more energy an electron has. This is because it takes more energy to maintain an electron in an orbit that is far from the nucleus. Consequently, when an electron moves to a higher energy level it absorbs energy, and when it drops to a lower energy level it releases energy. Therefore, an electron with an increased energy level will possess more energy."},{"question":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Drew Carey rose to fame on his sitcom, The Drew Carey Show, and also hosted Whose Line Is It Anyway.\\" Options: - yes - no Your chain-of-thought:","response":"Yes, the sentence makes sense.

Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

Here, the sequence of numbers is 444, 300, 200, 136, 87, 84, and 80. We need to find the differences between consecutive numbers to identify the pattern. First differences: 300 - 444 = -144 200 - 300 = -100 136 - 200 = -64 87 - 136 = -49 84 - 87 = -3 80 - 84 = -4 The differences are: -144, -100, -64, -49, -3, -4. Now, let's analyze these differences. We can quickly observe that most of the differences are decreasing, except for the last difference, which goes from -3 to -4. However, this is not enough to identify a pattern. Let's dig deeper and check the factors of the differences. -144 has factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144. -100 has factors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100. -64 has factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. -49 has factors: 1, 7, and 49. -3 has factors: 1 and 3. -4 has factors: 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the factors, we can see that -144, -100, and -64 are all divisible by 4. However, the smaller differences (-49, -3, -4) don't follow this pattern, with -49 and -3 both being prime numbers. This indicates that the odd one out is the first number after the significant shift in differences i.e. when the pattern shifts from numbers divisible by 4 to the smaller prime numbers. Therefore, the odd one out is the number 87. So the answer is: (B) 87"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

This could mean a car, bus, train, plane, or other types of vehicles. Therefore, it doesn't specifically confirm that the man is on a bus - which the premise specifically mentions. Additionally, the two key specifics in the original premise \\"A young man traveling on bus with a piece of flower in his hands\\", are a) the man is young and b) he is holding a flower. The statement \\"A man is inside a vehicle\\" does not provide any information about the age of the man, or about any objects he might be carrying, such as a piece of flower. Thus, although it's possible that the statement \\"A man is inside a vehicle\\" could be describing the same scene as the original premise — if the vehicle is a bus, and the man is young and holding a flower — there is not enough detailed information in the statement to definitively confirm the truth of the original premise. These premises reflect the corresponding complexities of dealing with verification and truth in the real world: a single statement can often be applicable to a variety of contexts and contain imprecise or incomplete information, which limits the extent to which it can be used to confirm other facts or premises. Therefore, while the two statements could potentially be describing the same event, the statement \\"A man is inside a vehicle\\" does not provide enough specific detail to conclusively verify the premise \\"A young man traveling on bus with a piece of flower in his hands.\\" It is crucial to consider these factors when interpreting statements, particularly when assessing their truth value in relation to other suggested premises."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Nature is full of color, from rainbows and roses to butterfly wings and peacock tails. Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun. Ultraviolet light isn't the only source of free radicals. If you breathe polluted air such as smog, automobile exhaust , or wasted gas from a factory, you take in chemicals that also cause such damage. And, the body itself produces free radicals as it processes food. Which of the following can not cause free radicals to form? A) Colorful food B) UV light from the sun C) Polluted air D) The body itself Answer:","response":"A) Colorful food"},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"Broz himself explains:\\" answer the question \\"\\"Rudi\\", \\"Walter\\" and \\"Tito\\" are names that what person assumed?\\"","response":"No, dear, the sentence \\"Broz himself explains:\\" does not answer the question \\"Rudi,\\" \\"Walter\\" and \\"Tito\\" are names that what person assumed?\\".

It was produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous record \\"Definitely Maybe\\". Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on huge choruses, with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation on the record contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" was the group's first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll. - \\"Some Might Say\\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis. It was released as the first single on 24 April 1995 from their second studio album, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" (1995). The song was written by the band's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. \\"Some Might Say\\" provided Oasis with their first number one in the UK Singles Chart. - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure.

In cases where it is legal to advertise a job for one gender only eg. personal care for vulnerable people, how are transgender people treated? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"The two questions you have presented touch upon different aspects of law and social issues, but they are not the same. Let me provide detailed answers for both: 1. Legality of screenshotting and sharing private conversations without consent in Washington: In the state of Washington, this issue falls under the categories of privacy laws and wiretapping statutes. Washington is a two-party consent state, which means that recording any private communication, whether it is oral or electronic, requires consent from all parties involved in the communication under the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 9.73.030. However, the wiretapping law does not exactly apply to the situation you presented, which is taking a screenshot of a conversation between two other persons and sharing it without their consent. Washington's privacy laws protect individuals from intrusion into their private affairs, but it is not explicitly clear how this applies to screenshotting and sharing text messages without consent. If any of the individuals involved view the sharing of their private conversation without permission as an invasion of their privacy or as causing harm to their reputation, they could have grounds to bring a civil lawsuit against the person who took and shared the screenshot. However, this will depend on the specific circumstances and the potential harm caused. 2. Advertising a job for one gender only in relation to transgender individuals: In cases where a job advertisement is designed to target one specific gender, there are certain exceptions under anti-discrimination laws. One such situation is the Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) exception, which acknowledges that specific roles may require the employee to be of a particular gender due to the nature of the work (e.g., a personal caretaker for vulnerable individuals). Regarding transgender individuals in these situations, the interpretation will vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific laws in place. Nevertheless, numerous states and local authorities have established provisions to protect transgender people from discrimination based on gender identity. In the context of Washington state, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited under the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), RCW 49.60. Employment practices, including recruitment, hiring, and job assignments, must be free from such discrimination. Transgender individuals should be treated fairly and equitably within the hiring process. If a transgender applicant can perform the essential job functions related to the BFOQ exception, then they should be given just as much consideration as a cisgender applicant. In summary, while both questions address legal and social concerns, they address distinct issues. The first question examines the potential legal ramifications of sharing private conversations without consent, while the second question assesses the legality and treatment of transgender individuals in the context of gender-specific job advertisements."},{"question":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year.

And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter.

Fill a bowl with cool water and carefully dip the flowers in to rinse them clean. Set them out on a clean towel to dry for 30 minutes to an hour. It’s especially important to rinse the flowers if you’ve picked them yourself. If you’ve purchased edible flowers for a store or website, they’ve likely already been rinsed. However, it’s a good idea to rinse them yourself to be sure that all of the dirt is removed. You want your ice cubes to be as clear as possible so the blooms stand out. Start with distilled water so the impurities have been removed, and place it in a saucepan. Heat the water on the stove at high heat until it comes to a boil, and then allow the water to boil for 2 to 3 minute. The amount of water that you’ll need to boil depends on how many ice cubes you plan to make. Add water to the tray until they’re full and dump it directly into the saucepan to ensure that you have enough. You shouldn’t add the boiled water to the ice tray right after you remove it from the stove. Instead, let the water sit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes or until it’s cooled completely to avoid imperfections in the finished ice cubes. Before you add the flowers and water to the ice tray, you should clean the tray to ensure that dirt and debris don’t wind up in your ice cubes. Rinse the tray with cool water and dishwashing soap, and wipe out each compartment with a clean kitchen towel or piece of paper towel. Silicone ice trays are usually the best option when making blossom ice cubes. It’s easier to remove the cubes from the tray without breaking them because the tray is flexible.

What was going on in that conversation?","response":"In this conversation, Matt and Layla are exchanging pleasantries and discussing their current states of mind. They are good friends who appear to share a light-hearted rapport and can tease each other. At the beginning of the conversation, Matt inquires about Layla's Friday, to which she playfully responds that she won't know until tomorrow, implying that it might not be Friday or she's not yet sure how her day will unfold. Matt then realizes that he made a mistake about the day of the week, which leads him to question why he feels so tired as if it were Friday. He also lightheartedly self-deprecates by stating that he doesn't know the days of the week. Layla, concerned, asks if Matt had a tough week and wants to find out what has been troubling him. Matt then opens up, mentioning that it has been a difficult year for him, characterized by an overwhelming amount of work and a lack of sleep. This statement shows that Matt trusts Layla enough to share his personal struggles, while also offering Layla an opportunity to offer support or advice in return. To summarize, this conversation revolves around personal well-being, time confusion, and the challenges of daily life. It demonstrates a friendly, caring dynamic between Matt and Layla and provides a basis for discussing their respective experiences and emotional states."},{"question":"Read this and answer the question.

Sentence A: \\"Fast food is very unhealthy.\\" Explanation: Fast food is generally known to be high in calories, saturated fats, trans fats, sugar, and sodium.

The term \\"Spumante\\" is derived from the Italian word \\"spuma,\\" which means \\"foam\\" or \\"froth.\\" The name is a reference to the bubbles or effervescence that is characteristic of sparkling wines. It is important to note that not all Italian sparkling wines are referred to as Spumante, as there are different categories of sparkling wines with varying levels of effervescence. Spumante wines are generally produced using two primary methods - Metodo Classico (also known as the Traditional Method or the Champagne Method) and Metodo Martinotti (also known as the Charmat Method or the Tank Method). These methods determine the fermentation process, which in turn affects the taste, quality, and overall characteristics of the Spumante. 1. Metodo Classico (Traditional Method): This method is the same as the one used to produce Champagne in France. It involves two separate fermentation processes, with the second fermentation taking place inside the bottle. The wine is left in contact with the yeast (or lees) for an extended period, ranging from several months to several years. This contact contributes to the development of complex flavors and textures in the wine. The most famous Spumante produced with this method is Franciacorta. 2. Metodo Martinotti (Charmat Method): This method, developed by Federico Martinotti in the late 19th century and later improved by Eugène Charmat in the early 20th century, involves a single fermentation in large, pressurized stainless-steel tanks. The secondary fermentation takes place in these sealed tanks, and the wine is then bottled under pressure to maintain the carbonation. This method is faster than the Metodo Classico and generally results in fresher, fruitier wines with fewer yeast-derived flavors. Prosecco and Asti Spumante are popular examples of Spumante produced using the Charmat Method. Italian Spumante wines can be made from various grape varieties, each having its unique characteristics and flavor profiles. Some of the most common grape varieties used in Spumante production include: 1. Glera: The primary grape used in the production of Prosecco. It is a white grape variety with high acidity, which contributes to the fresh, fruity, and aromatic qualities of Prosecco. 2. Moscato (Muscat): A white grape variety primarily used for making sweet, aromatic, and low-alcohol sparkling wines such as Asti Spumante and Moscato d'Asti. Moscato grapes have a distinct floral and fruity aroma, often described as having notes of orange blossom, peach, and apricot. 3. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Bianco: These grape varieties, also used in Champagne production, are primarily associated with Franciacorta, a high-quality Italian Spumante made using the Metodo Classico. The blend of these grapes can create a wide range of flavors and textures, from crisp and citrusy to rich and toasty. In conclusion, \\"What is Spumante?\\" is a question exploring the world of Italian sparkling wines, delving into the production methods, grape varieties, and regional styles that make up this diverse and delightful category of wines. Whether you prefer the elegance and complexity of Franciacorta or the refreshing and fruity flavors of Prosecco, Spumante offers something for every palate and occasion."},{"question":"Facts: - years active: 1985 -- present - birth date: 7 august 1962 - name: Željko pervan - birth place: zagreb , sfr yugoslavia - occupation: actor Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of Željko pervan .","response":"Željko Pervan was born on August 7, 1962, in Zagreb, SFR Yugoslavia.

Isabel, a young woman in her early 20s, is a patient at the hospital, diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Sarah, a nurse in her late 20s, is new to the facility, having recently moved to the town to escape her own troubled past. Sarah becomes close to Isabel, bonding over shared experiences and a mutual love for painting. One rainy night, Sarah discovers Isabel lifeless in the hospital courtyard, an apparent victim of a terrible accident. Act 2: The Investigation In the aftermath of Isabel's death, Sarah goes through her belongings and finds Isabel's sketchbook, filled with mysterious symbols and cryptic drawings related to the hospital's hidden past. As she delves deeper into Isabel's world, Sarah suspects that her death was not an accident but a murder. With the help of Jack, a sympathetic detective from the town, Sarah begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding Isabel's death. The duo uncover stories of abuse, neglect, and mistreatment going back decades. Throughout their investigation, they are met with resistance from hospital staff and the town's people. Act 3: Uncovering the Truth Jack and Sarah eventually discover that Isabel stumbled upon a long-hidden secret which directly connects the town's wealthiest family to the ongoing abuse at the psychiatric hospital.

Literal Translation: A literal translation or identical concepts would result in a high score - around 4 or 5. We want to aim for a 2, which requires us to keep some of the concepts but reorganize, reinterpret, or omit others. 2. Core Concept: The core concept in the initial sentence is a new study challenging a traditional narrative (the Titanic story). We should retain this concept but express them in a different manner. 3. Vocabulary Changes: I changed \\"shows\\" to \\"doesn't support\\", \\"stand up to scrutiny\\" to \\"-\\", and \\"Titanic story\\" to \\"the tale of the Titanic\\". This retains the core idea but diverges in language. 4. Opinion expression: The original sentence is expressed as a personal opinion (\\"imo\\" - internet slang for \\"In my opinion\\"). I retained this by stating \\"In my view,\\". 5. Phrase Rearrangement: I substantially rearranged phrases in the sentence without distorting the original meaning but giving a different arrangement and flow to the sentence. This step-wise approach helped in achieving a lower similarity score while retaining the essence of the original sentence."},{"question":"Does the sentence \\"Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern aircraft.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was used in the construction of modern aircraft?\\"","response":"Yes, the sentence provides a valid answer to the question.

On Sunday tank and mortar rounds pounded the village - Shyrokyne - near government-held Mariupol, a vital port city. Mr Tusk said the EU would send a civilian \\"assessment\\" mission to Kiev, to explore ways to further boost security assistance for Ukraine. The heavily armed rebels have been fighting government forces for a year in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The West accuses Russia of arming the rebels and sending in regular soldiers. Moscow denies that, insisting that any Russians on the rebel side are volunteers. Mr Poroshenko says peacekeepers are needed to ensure proper monitoring of frontline areas and the rebel-controlled border with Russia. Mr Tusk said: \\"We are concerned about reports of weapons still entering eastern Ukraine\\". International OSCE observers were \\"not able to verify a withdrawal of heavy weaponry\\", he said. Under the Minsk ceasefire deal signed in February both sides were supposed to pull heavy weapons back from the conflict zone. Mr Tusk reiterated that EU sanctions against Russia would remain in place until the Minsk conditions were met in full. On Sunday OSCE observers said they experienced the most intense shelling of Shyrokyne since fighting began there in mid-February. Heavy weapons including tanks were spotted in rebel-held areas near there, they said. Fighting hits Ukraine's EU ambitions - by Tom Burridge, BBC News, Donetsk: As the leaders met in Kiev, we could hear the steady boom of shelling in a bombed-out neighbourhood, on the edge of Donetsk. Valentina, 54, emerged from her blackened apartment block, with most of its windows smashed, to tell us of \\"constant fighting, every single day\\". \\"We're sick of all this,\\" she said as tears filled her eyes. \\"It's affecting us psychologically.\\" We watched some 20 pro-Russian fighters travel back from the frontline on top of an armoured personnel carrier, and another group of around 20 replace them, heading towards the fighting. A tank was parked up, idle for now. Tank shells were visible in the back of another vehicle. According to a rebel soldier, we were about 2km (one mile) from the frontline. When you see and hear fighting on a daily basis in eastern Ukraine, at least some of the political and economic aspirations of European and Ukrainian leaders seem hollow. The economic cost of the war undermines Ukraine's ambition for greater economic integration with the EU. It also makes some political aspirations, like visa-free travel for Ukrainian citizens in the EU, highly unlikely. Yet the EU leaders' visit is hugely symbolic. They are keen to show solidarity in the face of what they see as Russian-fuelled aggression in the east. But the rebels will probably interpret the summit as another provocation. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also attended the Kiev talks. It is the first such summit since a key EU-Ukraine association agreement was signed last June. Talks will continue in Kiev on Tuesday. The EU is anxious for Ukraine to enact far-reaching economic reforms to tackle unsustainable debts, inflation and widespread corruption. The EU agreed to delay implementing the association deal with Ukraine until January 2016, in response to Russian complaints. Russia is suspicious of the agreement, arguing that free trade could turn Ukraine into a conduit for cheap goods flooding into Russia. Mr Juncker said Ukrainians' living conditions were \\"very difficult\\", and he pledged more EU financial assistance to help in the \\"painful\\" reform process. \\"Ukrainian citizens want to live in a corruption-free country,\\" he said. Reform of the heavily subsidised energy sector is a priority, BBC economics expert Andrew Walker says, as energy inefficiencies are a big drain on the national budget. What is a summary of this text?","response":"A big meeting happened in a place called Kiev. Important people from different countries talked about the problems in Ukraine. There are some people who don't agree with the government and they are fighting. European leaders want to help Ukraine be more secure and peaceful. A group called OSCE is watching what's happening, but there is still fighting in some villages. The leaders believe that if everyone follows the rules of an agreement they made, called the Minsk ceasefire deal, then things can be better. The European Union also wants Ukraine to make some changes to help fix their money problems."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. Premise: \\"A child sitting on the ground.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The child is standing.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Understand the Premise The premise states that \\"A child is sitting on the ground.\\" This means that the child's primary point of contact with the ground is through their lower body (such as hips, buttock), and their legs are bent or folded under themselves. Step 2: Understand the Hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"The child is standing.\\" Standing involves a person being upright, with their legs straight and feet touching the ground, supporting the body weight. Step 3: Compare the Premise and Hypothesis Compare the two statements to see if they can both be true at the same time. If a child is sitting on the ground, their body position conflicts with the position needed to be considered standing. A child cannot be both sitting and standing simultaneously since their lower body and leg positions are mutually exclusive in each case. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise As we can see from comparing the premise and hypothesis, they are contradictory statements. Hence, it is not possible for the hypothesis to be entailed by the premise. They describe two different body positions that cannot coexist for a single child. Conclusion: No, the hypothesis \\"The child is standing\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"A child sitting on the ground,\\" as both statements describe different and mutually exclusive body positions."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: The next item is the statements by the Commission and the Council on the failure by the US Senate to ratify the treaty imposing a wholesale ban on nuclear testing.

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Use your imagination. Snap out of it, literally. Distract yourself.\\"","response":"Title: Escaping the Emotional Prison: Brilliant Ways to Help You Snap Out of It Introduction We've all been there - stuck in a negativity loop or trapped by overwhelming emotions. It's an all-too-familiar situation that can drain us mentally, emotionally, and even physically. However, finding a way to break free from this emotional prison can be a daunting task. In this article, we will explore effective techniques to help you snap out of it and regain control over your mental well-being. These techniques include thinking about someone else, using your imagination, and finding ways to distract yourself. 1. The Power of Empathy: Thinking about Someone Else When we are absorbed in our own thoughts, problems and emotions, it can be difficult to think beyond ourselves. However, realizing that the world doesn't revolve around us can be a powerful tool in breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. One way to do this is by thinking about someone else, be it a friend, family member, or even a stranger. Try to put yourself in their shoes, feel what they're going through, and imagine how you can support them. This shift in focus can help you see things from a different perspective, reduce the intensity of your own emotions, and allow you to regain a sense of balance. 2. A Creative Escape: Using Your Imagination Sometimes, a creative outlet can be the key to breaking free from our emotional prison. Your imagination can serve as a gateway to a world where your thoughts and feelings are no longer confined. Engage in activities that allow your mind to wander and explore different scenarios, such as reading, writing, painting, or even daydreaming. Losing yourself in a story or artwork can help break the chains that bind you to your current emotional state and provide a brief respite from reality. As a bonus, these creative pursuits can also lead to personal growth and self-discovery. 3. Seeking Distractions: Finding Relief in Hobbies and Activities When you're trapped in a spiral of negativity, it can feel impossible to break free. One effective way to do this is by engaging in activities that genuinely interest or excite you. Surround yourself with hobbies that you enjoy, participate in social gatherings, or explore new experiences. For instance, exercise has been proven to have a positive effect on mood and mental health. Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins that can help counteract negative emotions, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Find an exercise routine that you enjoy, whether it's jogging, yoga, dancing, or any other form of physical activity. 4. Practicing Mindfulness and Gratitude Staying present in the moment can also help snap you out of your emotional struggles. Mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and deep-breathing exercises, can help ground you in the present moment and provide relief from anxious or negative thoughts. Gratitude practices, like journaling about things you are thankful for or expressing gratitude to others, can also help shift your focus from what's troubling you to the positive aspects of your life. Conclusion Breaking free from a negative thought cycle or emotional turmoil can seem challenging, but it is possible with the right techniques and mindset. By thinking about someone else, using your imagination, finding distractions through enjoyable activities, and practicing mindfulness and gratitude, you can regain control of your mental well-being and free yourself from the emotional prison that has held you captive. Remember, you have the power to choose your thoughts and actions, so take control and create a life of happiness and emotional balance."},{"question":"What is the point of a silver trumpet? How many different keys do trumpets come in? Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"1. The point of a silver trumpet is to help people make music. A silver trumpet is a shiny, metal instrument that you blow air into. When you push down different buttons, called valves, and blow into the mouthpiece, it helps to create different sounds or musical notes. People use silver trumpets to play songs, perform in bands, and entertain others with beautiful sounds. 2. Trumpets can come in different keys, which means they can play music in different musical scales. The most common trumpet is the B-flat trumpet, but there are also trumpets in the keys of C, D, E-flat, and piccolo trumpets, among others. Each type of trumpet creates a unique sound and is used for playing various types of music. 3. Those questions don't have the same meaning. The first question asks about the purpose of a silver trumpet, while the second question asks about the different keys in which trumpets come. The main similarity is that both questions are about trumpets, but they ask about different aspects of the instrument."},{"question":"Same meaning? It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid foods or soften loose particles . It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid food or to soften loose particles .","response":"Yes, these two sentences have the same meaning. They both describe the function of an unspecified subject or tool that serves to collect saliva, which is then used to distribute solid food or soften loose particles. Let us break down the similarities and differences of the two sentences to better understand their meanings. 1. Sentence 1: \\"It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid foods or soften loose particles.\\" 2. Sentence 2: \\"It is also used to collect saliva to distribute solid food or to soften loose particles.\\" In both sentences, \\"it\\" refers to an unspecified subject or tool that serves a certain function. The phrases \\"is also used\\" in both sentences suggest that the function explained in the sentences is an additional use or purpose of the subject or tool. The functions described in both sentences are the same, as they involve collecting saliva for two purposes: distributing solid food and softening loose particles. Now, let's focus on the slight differences in the wording of the two sentences: Difference 1: In Sentence 1, the term \\"solid foods\\" is written in plural form, while in Sentence 2, the term \\"solid food\\" is singular. Difference 2: In terms of structure, Sentence 1 combines the two purposes of collecting saliva into a single continuous phrase without the use of the word \\"to\\" before \\"soften.\\" Sentence 2, however, uses the word \\"to\\" before \\"soften,\\" which makes each purpose a separate phrase. Despite these slight structural and grammatical differences, the overall meaning and message of the two sentences remain the same. They both convey that the subject or tool in question has a secondary purpose of collecting saliva, which in turn serves two functions: distributing solid food and softening loose particles."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Why is economic a social science? In what way is economics a social science?","response":"No, the following two questions are not the same and require different perspectives in answering them. Let's break down each question to understand the difference: 1. Why is economics a social science? This question asks for the reasons behind categorizing economics as a social science. Answering this question requires providing an explanation of how economics meets the criteria of social science and how it relates to the study of human interactions and societal aspects. Economics is a social science because it aims to understand and explain human behavior related to the production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services. As with other social sciences like sociology, psychology, and political science, economics studies human interactions and seeks to comprehend and predict patterns of social behavior. Economics is concerned with the ways in which individuals and groups allocate resources in society. It investigates human behavior through the lens of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost, which are the fundamental phenomena driving economic interactions. By understanding and predicting the choices that people make, economists can analyze how these decisions influence markets, governments, businesses, and people's lives in general. As a social science, economics employs empirical methods and theories to analyze real-world situations and establish causal relationships between variables. Economists use various models and methodologies, including surveys, experiments, and statistical analyses, to test hypotheses and derive insights about how individuals, institutions, and societies operate within economic contexts. 2. In what way is economics a social science? This question asks for a description of how economics functions as a social science, involving a focus on the similarities and methodologies that economics shares with other social sciences. Economics is a social science in the way it deals with human interactions and societal behavior related to economic decision-making. Here are some ways economics aligns with the broader field of social sciences: a. Subject matter: Economics, like other social sciences, examines human behaviors, choices, and actions in society. It focuses on how people allocate resources, make decisions, form institutions, establish rules and regulations, and cooperate or compete in various economic settings. b. Methodological approach: Economics employs qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis similar to other social sciences. It relies on observation, data collection, empirical evidence, and case studies to derive patterns and insights about human behavior in economic contexts. c. Theoretical framework: Economists build and refine theory in response to empirical findings, just like scholars in fields like psychology, sociology, and anthropology. They use these theories to form testable hypotheses, make predictions, and explain existing phenomena related to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in society. d. Interdisciplinary connections: Economics shares many interdisciplinary connections with other social sciences. For instance, it overlaps with political science when examining public policies, taxation, and government spending, or with sociology when exploring income inequality and social mobility. In sum, economics is a social science because it examines how humans behave in the context of economic decision-making. It shares similar subject matter, methodological approaches, theoretical frameworks, and interdisciplinary connections with other social science disciplines. However, the two questions address different aspects of this relationship – the first question asks about the reasons for categorizing economics as a social science, whereas the second question delves into the ways in which economics functions as one."},{"question":"Suspicious Death in Argentina Some Argentines are calling Alberto Nisman, the maverick prosecutor, the 86th casualty of one of the deadliest, unsolved terrorists attacks in modern history: the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. That seems fitting whether his death over the weekend turns out to be a suicide, as the government of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner seems eager to establish, or the murder of a man who had learned too much. This much is clear: The best hope of definitively establishing the truth about the horrific July 18, 1994, bombing and its tortured, politicized investigation is to impanel an international team of jurists who can take a fresh, objective look at the evidence. The truth became more important after Mr. Nisman’s body was discovered inside his apartment on Sunday, hours before he was expected to testify on his startling allegation that Ms. Kirchner cut a deal with the Iranian government to protect some of the culprits of the attack. Ms. Kirchner’s late husband, former president Néstor Kirchner, appointed Mr. Nisman to lead the inquiry a decade ago after acknowledging a shocking series of blunders by those assigned to the case over the years. Mr. Nisman, 51, became convinced that the bombing was carried out by the Shiite militant movement Hezbollah under orders of the Iranian government. Based on the prosecutor’s investigation, Argentina got Interpol to issue arrest notices for seven prominent Iranians, including a Hezbollah leader and several government officials. In a strange twist, in January 2013, Argentina announced it had reached a deal with Iran to establish a “truth commission” that would investigate the case jointly. The notion that Iran could be counted on to play a constructive role was questionable at best and rightly met with skepticism from Argentina’s Jewish community. Earlier this month, Mr. Nisman unveiled a 300-page complaint charging that Ms. Kirchner and Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman conspired to absolve top Iranian officials in exchange for commercial deals that would benefit both cash-strapped governments. President Kirchner issued stern denials. Mr. Nisman said he would corroborate the allegations in a congressional hearing on Monday. According to the Argentine press, there were no signs that Mr. Nisman was suicidal in recent days. Over the weekend, he prepared for the hearing. He wrote a grocery list for his maid to run to the store on Monday. Despite having a 10-person security detail, Mr. Nisman signaled that he was concerned for his safety, telling an Argentine journalist, Natasha Niebieskikwiat, on Saturday: “I might turn up dead from all this.” Ms. Kirchner, a pugnacious stateswoman who has been vindictive toward enemies in the press and politics, weighed in on the case in a lengthy, rambling statement posted on her personal website late Monday. “Suicide,” she wrote, is always a befuddling act. “What led a person to make such a terrible decision and end their life?” Missing from her note was a message of condolence for Mr. Nisman’s family. But the most glaring omission is the fact that the manner of death is far from a settled question. A version of this editorial appears in print on January 21, 2015, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Suspicious Death in Argentina. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was found dead in his apartment just hours before he was due to testify about his allegations that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina had made a deal with the Iranian government to protect those involved in the attack. Nisman had been appointed to this decade-long inquiry by Kirchner’s late husband and former President, Néstor Kirchner, due to previous mishandling of the case. Nisman's investigation resulted in Interpol issuing arrest warrants for several Iranian officials. However, in 2013 Argentina and Iran announced the establishment of a \\"truth commission,\\" a move met with skepticism, especially from Argentina's Jewish community. Earlier this month, Nisman filed a complaint in which he alleged that President Kirchner and her Foreign Minister, Héctor Timerman, were conspiring to exonerate high-ranking Iranian officials in exchange for profitable trade deals. Despite warnings of a potential threat to his life, Nisman's death has been declared a suicide, a conclusion that many find suspicious. In response to the controversy, President Kirchner has released a meandering statement on the incident, focusing more on the mystery of suicide than addressing the suspicions surrounding Nisman's death. Consequently, many are calling for an international team of jurists to undertake a fresh, impartial investigation into both the bombing and Nisman's death."},{"question":"\\"see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","response":"This sentence means that the movie is using ideas from older movies, but it does it in a way that feels new and special.

The remaining ones take 50% longer each to repair. He makes 20 per hour repairing cars. How much money does he make?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To determine how much money John makes, we need to calculate the total time it takes to repair all 5 cars and then multiply it by his hourly rate. First, let's find the time it takes to repair the first 3 cars: 3 cars * 40 minutes each = 120 minutes Now, let's find the time it takes to repair the remaining 2 cars. Since they take 50% longer, we need to determine how much longer that is in minutes: 40 minutes * 50% = 20 minutes This means each of the remaining 2 cars takes 60 minutes (40 + 20) to repair. Now we can calculate the total time spent on these 2 cars: 2 cars * 60 minutes each = 120 minutes Now, we can calculate the total time it took John to repair all 5 cars: 120 minutes (first 3 cars) + 120 minutes (last 2 cars) = 240 minutes We will now convert the total repair time to hours: 240 minutes / 60 (minutes per hour) = 4 hours Finally, we can determine how much money John makes by multiplying the total hours worked by his hourly rate: 4 hours * 20 per hour = 80 So, John makes 80 from repairing these 5 cars."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a conversation between a flight agent and the customer.

I am disappointed to say that this app does not live up to my expectations and necessitates further improvements before it aligns with the scale of the competition. Upon launching the app, I was glad to see its simplistic user interface. It seemed easy to navigate, with large, apparent icons. However, that was just the tip of an iceberg. As I began to explore deeper, I encountered several issues, which have prompted me to give it a 2-star rating. Firstly, the app's performance was subpar. It is slow and prone to crashes, locking my device or freezing at certain points when loading or browsing books. Opening my eBook library often takes so long that I lose the interest to read. Moreover, it occasionally failed to recognize certain file formats, which further complicated my experience. Secondly, the app severely lacks in the customization department. Users have limited options when it comes to font selection, color themes, and formatting. The absence of a night mode, which has become a standard in most e-reader apps nowadays, also struck me as a major setback. I often read in low-light situations and not having a night mode causes strain on my eyes. Another drawback is the search functionality, which needs improvement. The search results often differ from the actual book titles or authors I am searching for, making it challenging to locate specific eBooks. Furthermore, there is no option for searching within the text of the books, which is an essential feature for research-oriented reading. The in-app store integration, although convenient, is limited in the selection of books available. While the app provides a platform to access several bookstores, the titles and genres offered do not cater to a diverse audience. Plus, navigating through the bookstores feels cumbersome, discouraging users from exploring more. Lastly, one of the crucial aspects that define a good e-reader app: customer support – is sadly inadequate here. When I reached out to the support team for assistance with some issues, I was met with delayed responses and mostly unhelpful answers that lacked in-depth instructions. As a paying user, I expect better customer service to be part of my experience. In conclusion, while org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android app has some potential, it requires significant work in many areas to become a worthwhile choice for e-reading enthusiasts. With improvements in the app performance, customization options, search functionality, in-app store integration, and customer support, it may be able to earn a better rating. However, for now, I struggle to recommend this app to fellow avid readers."},{"question":"These kind-hearted divers removed a fishing hook from the jaws of a 6ft silky shark after coaxing it into a natural trance. Friends Cameron Nimmo, 26, and Mickey Smith, 25, grabbed the fish by the tail and twisted it upside down, paralysing it in a state called tonic immobility. It is a well-known phenomenon that affects certain shark species, including Great Whites and tiger sharks, and can last for up to 15 minutes. Scroll down for video. Just when you thought it was safe: Divers Cameron Nimmo and Mickey Smith, from Florida, make it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths and bodies of the silky sharks they encounter in coastal waters. Success: Mr Nimmo, 26, holds up the hook after removing it from the shark's jaws. Although twisting the animals upside down puts them in a state called tonic immobility, this one quickly awoke and swam away. But when the pair - who nickname themselves Shark Addicts - removed the hook with a pair of pliers, it was enough to stir the animal rapidly back into life as it darted away. The friends see anywhere from five to 20 sharks on each dive off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, and say three-quarters of them have hooks embedded somewhere in their bodies. Fishermen often target silky sharks, which are numerous off the southeastern U.S. coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. But they can also be caught accidentally by people trying to catch other species such as tuna. Mr Nimmo said: 'It happens when people who are fishing. They catch them and cut the line so they don't have to bring it on the boat, or the shark breaks the line. Tough job: The pair use pliers to extract the hooks, which they say affect three-quarters of the sharks they see. Technique: The sharks are flipped upside down by holding them gently by the tail and twisting their bodies. Flipped: Once the sharks are the wrong way up, they are paralysed for up to 15 minutes. Scientists disagree over the origins of the phenomenon, which affects several species and can be triggered in different ways. 'Taking a hook out feels great, knowing you have helped one of these magnificent creatures makes it all worth it.' The Shark Addicts said they had made it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths, noses and bodies of every shark they can. 'I love popping the hooks out,' said Mr Nimmo. 'There is some danger there but the last thing I'm thinking about it getting bitten - I just want to get the hook out. 'We love sharks so much and want to be around them as much as possible. We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through the videos that Mickey films. 'We want to help protect our oceans and marine life.' Animal kingdom: The pair love sharks and despite silky sharks growing up to 10ft, they rarely feel in danger. Despite publicity, shark attacks are relatively extremely rare. Mr Nimmo said: 'We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through our videos. We want to help protect our oceans and marine life' The friends hope to turn their passion into a business and teach others about the importance of caring for sharks. Silky sharks are common near the coasts of the Americas, Australia and West Africa. They can live for more than 20 years and grow up to 10ft long, and although their size and jaws make them potentially dangerous to humans, attacks are fairly rare.

Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective.

Here are possible answers to this question: - laugh - sit - being entertained - math - meet I believe the correct choice is \\"meet\\", here's why: A:","response":"The correct choice is indeed \\"meet,\\" and I will explain why this is the most suitable option among the given choices: 1. Laugh: While laughter is undoubtedly a part of many interactions between friends, it may not necessarily happen before they go out to play. Additionally, laughing is more of a response to a specific situation or comment, and is not a preparatory action before playing. 2. Sit: Sitting is a passive activity, and it is not an action that typically occurs directly before engaging in play. Friends may sit together while hanging out or taking a break from playtime, but it is not a specific action to undertake before starting to play. 3. Being entertained: Although friends may entertain each other in various ways, being entertained is not a specific action that children undertake before playing. It is more likely that the entertainment would occur during their playtime or as a part of their activities while playing. 4. Math: Math is an academic subject and, while children might engage in math-related games or learning activities with their friends, it is not a general prerequisite for going to play. Math activities would typically take place either during school time or during dedicated study sessions. 5. Meet: Meeting up with friends is the most logical choice among the options provided, as children need to gather together before they can engage in any play activities. This often involves deciding on a meeting location, greeting each other, and then proceeding to participate in their desired form of play. In conclusion, \\"meet\\" is the most accurate and appropriate choice for describing what a kid might do with his friend before going to play. Meeting allows friends to come together, discuss the day's plans, and commence their chosen activities."},{"question":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: NetherlandsAntillesGuilder315.040NAF","response":"To add spaces to the text \\"NetherlandsAntillesGuilder315.040NAF\\", I will follow these steps: 1.

A six-year-old girl and four other spectators were critically hurt in the crash at Paqpaqli. Exhibitors and witnesses have questioned the track's safety, saying barriers offered little protection. The girl's condition had improved slightly on Monday, according to reports. The four others in a critical condition were in intensive care and their lives were still in danger, a hospital official said. Maltese government health spokesman Chris Fearne said 13 others were still in hospital, most of them with head and chest fractures, the Times of Malta reported. Mr Bailey, a self-made millionaire from Rutland in the East Midlands, was among those still being treated for a head injury. Minutes before the crash he was interviewed alongside some of the cars he had brought for the event in aid of a Maltese charity. Maltese TV broadcast video footage of the accident showing how his white Porsche 918 Spyder hit the grass on one side of the taxiway and careered across the road at high speed, through a makeshift barrier and into the crowd. \\"I saw people thrown in the air, children on the ground, and women crying and screaming,\\" Romanian photographer Christian Nicodimescu told Malta's TVM. Organisers immediately cancelled the rest of the event, which had been opened by President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca.

Michel Zarb, an exhibitor who had cars at the show, told the Malta Independent newspaper the safety measures were inadequate. \\"The barriers put up are the same as those used to keep people behind them as they wave to the Queen.\\" The organisers, which include the president's office, said the cause of the crash would have to be investigated, and have not responded to the criticism about safety measures.

Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, had poor relations with them, and failed to respect the chain of command in attempts at being transferred to another base. An argument evolves between base commander Colonel Nathan Jessup and his officers: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred immediately, Jessup regards this as akin to surrender and orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to train Santiago to become a better Marine. When Dawson and Downey are later arrested for Santiago's murder, naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway suspects they carried out a \\"code red\\" order, a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway asks to defend them, but instead, the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic U.S. Navy lawyer. Initially, friction exists between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's tendency to plea bargain, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and the prosecutor, his friend Captain Jack Ross (USMC), negotiate a bargain, but Dawson and Downey refuse to go along. They insist they were ordered by Kendrick to shave Santiago's head, minutes after Kendrick publicly ordered the platoon not to touch the would-be victim, and did not intend their victim to die. Kaffee is finally won over by Galloway and takes the case to court. In the course of the trial, the defense manages to establish the existence of \\"code red\\" orders at Guantanamo and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order, having been denied a promotion after helping out a fellow Marine who was under what could be seen as a \\"code red\\".

Tim preferred putting the medicine in a cheese ball instead of a spoon, because the","response":"dog found it more palatable and was more likely to consume it without any trouble. There are various reasons why Tim might have opted for this method of administering medicine to his pet. Let's explore these reasons in detail. 1. Camouflaging the medicine: One of the main challenges pet owners face while giving medication to their pets is the strong and often unpleasant taste of the medicine. By mixing the medicine with a cheese ball, Tim is effectively hiding the taste, making it easier for his dog to consume the medication without any hesitation. Cheese is a strong and flavorful food that can effectively cover up the medicine's taste. 2. Positive reinforcement: Many pets, especially dogs, love cheese. By using cheese as a vehicle for the medicine, Tim is turning an otherwise unpleasant experience into a treat for his pet. This can create a positive association with the medicine and make it more likely that the dog will not resist taking it in the future. 3. Easier swallowing: Dry pills can sometimes be difficult for dogs to swallow, as they may lodge in their throat or cause discomfort on the way down. By incorporating the medicine into a cheese ball, Tim is creating a soft, moist, and easy-to-swallow alternative to a dry pill that can make the process of taking medication much more comfortable for his pet. 4. Portion control: Making a cheese ball allows Tim to accurately measure the amount of medicine that his dog is receiving, as he can easily divide up the appropriate dose and mix it into a specific amount of cheese. This can help ensure that the dog is consistently getting the prescribed dose. 5. Reducing anxiety: Some pets may become anxious or fearful when they see their owner trying to administer a pill or use a spoon to give them liquid medicine. This anxiety can lead to pets trying to avoid or escape the situation, making it difficult for the owner to successfully give the medication. By incorporating the medicine into a tasty cheese ball, Tim is reducing the likelihood that his dog will feel anxious or stressed when it's time for the medicine. In conclusion, Tim preferred putting the medicine in a cheese ball instead of a spoon because it made the medication more palatable, allowing his dog to take it without any issues. This method not only masked the taste of the medicine but also made the process of administering the medication easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable for both Tim and his pet."},{"question":"Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who goes to San Francisco? ?

(Reuters) Warning: Graphic video accompanies this story. Police shot and killed a man on Sunday in downtown Los Angeles during an apparent struggle over an officer’s weapons. Officers responded to 911 calls regarding a potential robbery about noon on San Pedro Street near the Union Rescue Mission, Los Angeles police officer Dave Romero told The Washington Post. He said that when police arrived at the scene in what’s referred to as the city’s “skid row” — a homeless community lined with tents, trash and old grocery carts — they said they encountered a suspect and “use of force” ensued. He said the incident then escalated into an officer-involved shooting. A police official said it’s unclear whether the victim was homeless, though some witnesses claim he was. A bystander captured the incident on a video, which soon spread over social media. Footage shows what initially looks like a fist fight between a black police officer and the victim, who was also reportedly black, according to witnesses. Then at least three other officers helped wrestle him to the ground. Los Angles police commander Andrew Smith told the Los Angeles Times the man “began fighting and physically resisting the officers.” He said that at one point police tried to restrain him by using a taser, which as “ineffective.” He said the man continued to fight the officers, some of whom fell down — but that scenario is not clear in the video footage. Before a homeless man was fatally shot, he \\"forcibly grabbed one of the officers holstered pistols, resulting in an officer involved shooting,\\" said Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck. (Reuters) During the incident, it appears the black officer may have dropped his baton and a woman on the street grabbed it. The officer can be heard shouting: “Get my stick! Get my stick! Get my stick!” Then two officers take her down and handcuff her. “At some point in there, a struggle over one of the officer’s weapons occurred,” Smith told the Los Angeles Times. “At that point an officer-involved shooting happened.” Smith said three officers, one of whom was a sergeant, fired at the victim. Someone in the video can be heard yelling, “drop the gun,” followed by at least five gunshots. The victim was reportedly pronounced dead at the scene. For several minutes afterward, witnesses can be heard shouting profanities, calling officers a “coward” and “sellout” — one man claiming that a black cop shot and killed another black man. As the crowd grew more restless, police put up crime scene tape and several officers lined up, holding out their clubs. Smith said at least one officer was wearing a body camera, according to Fox News KTTV. Both videos will be used in the police investigation, he said. Warning: The video below, posted to Facebook, contains graphic language. Police have not released the victim’s name but witnesses have identified him by a nickname, “Africa,” and said he was homeless, the Los Angeles Times reported. That could not be immediately confirmed. Yolanda Young told CBS Los Angeles the victim was fighting with another man inside a tent and, when police arrived, started fighting them. “Next thing I know,” she said, “dude swung on a cop and the cop swung back. And they were hitting on him and then two other cop cars pulled up and they got out of the car and ran over there, and they had three tasers out.” But Young told Fox News KTTV the man was not armed. “He didn’t have no weapon, they just shot him,” she said. “They could have just wrestled him down and took him to jail, but they shot him five times. ” Another witness, Jose Gil, told the Los Angeles Times he saw the man swinging at police. Then he heard an officer shout, “Gun, gun, he’s got my gun!” On Sunday night, a small group of protesters gathered in Los Angeles’s Pershing Square. “It’s awful. I mean you see it online, that’s where I saw it first. It’s ridiculous,” protester Sal Shama told CBS Los Angeles. “The problem here is we have a police chief who doesn’t have any answers to what’s going on.” Local civil rights leaders, including Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable president Earl Ofari Hutchinson, are urging the Los Angeles Police Commission to hold a hearing on this incident and others like it, the news station reported. Smith told the Los Angeles Times authorities have seen the video. “Any video that shows someone losing their life in an altercation with police is going to be disturbing,” he said. “It’s disturbing for police officers to watch.” “It’s always tragic when there’s a loss of life in one of these situations,” he added. “It’s not an incident taken lightly by any police officer. But we are committed to everyone involved and to the public to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.” This story has been updated.

High school is a big place where teenagers go to learn lots of things before they become grown-ups. Sometimes, a few kids leave high school early for different reasons, like they don't feel happy there or they think they can learn on their own. The story we are going to share is about some of these special kids who, even though they left high school, grew up to become very rich and successful. Now, these kids were very different from each other, but they all had one thing in common: they had big dreams! They were brave enough to follow their hearts and work very hard to make their dreams come true. One such dreamy kid was called Richard Branson. Richard was a very curious boy, always asking questions and exploring new things. But he found it hard to read and write because of something called dyslexia, which made school difficult for him. So, he left high school and started his own business selling records, which are like big music CDs. This boy with big dreams worked so hard that his business grew, and he became a millionaire with a big company called Virgin Group. Today, this company does lots of things, like flying planes and sending rockets into space! Another special kid is Steve Jobs. He was interested in things called computers and technology. Steve thought school was boring and decided to leave. So, he started a little company with his friend, and they named it Apple. Steve and his friend made computers that looked like friendly apples, and people loved them! Their company grew bigger and bigger, and our friend Steve became a millionaire, too. Do you know that you probably have an Apple product at home? It could be an iPhone or an iPad! Our last amazing kid is Bill Gates. Bill was a really smart boy who loved playing with computers, too! He thought high school was not teaching him enough, so he left to start a company called Microsoft with his friend. Bill made software, which is like special computer language, that helped computers work better. People all over the world used his software, and because of that, Bill Gates became not just a millionaire, but the richest man in the world for a long time! These stories of millionaire high school dropouts teach us that even when things seem difficult, like not finishing school, if we chase our dreams and work hard, we can still reach for the stars and achieve amazing things. So always remember, my little reader, that no matter how you learn or where you learn it, when you grow up, you can be just as successful as these millionaire high school dropouts from our story.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","response":"It is relatively unlikely, but there are several risk factors that could potentially result in a person getting killed while walking to the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The VLT is an advanced observatory facility operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and is located at the Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert, Chile. The Atacama Desert is one of the driest and most remote places on Earth, making the environment quite challenging. Here are some potential risk factors that one might encounter while walking there: 1. Harsh weather conditions: The Atacama Desert has arid, extreme climate conditions which can potentially be dangerous. Prolonged exposure to extremely high temperatures during the day, or cold temperatures at night, may lead to dehydration, heatstroke, or hypothermia. 2. Dehydration: The extremely dry air and low humidity in the Atacama Desert can lead to severe dehydration if you don't carry and drink enough water. 3. Dangerous terrain: The desert terrain in the Atacama may include rocky, unstable ground, steep inclines or cliffs, and sandy areas which can be difficult to traverse. Accidents caused by falls, slips, or getting stuck in sand could be fatal. 4. Altitude sickness: The VLT is located at an altitude of 2,635 meters (8,645 feet) above sea level. It is possible for individuals to experience altitude sickness at higher elevations, which can manifest as breathing difficulties, dizziness, and nausea. It can be fatal in severe cases if not properly managed. 5. Wildlife: Although the Atacama Desert is not known for large, aggressive wildlife, it is home to various species of reptiles, insects, and arachnids. Some of these animals might be venomous, and a bite or sting could potentially be fatal if not treated promptly. 6. Getting lost: Due to its remoteness and the vastness of the desert, it is possible to become disoriented and lost while attempting to walk to the VLT. Without proper navigation tools, experience, or assistance, a person might be unable to find their way and succumb to the harsh desert environment. While the likelihood of getting killed walking to the VLT is relatively low, the Atacama Desert's challenging conditions and potential dangers should not be underestimated. It is highly advisable to utilize proper transportation methods, plan your journey well, and be fully prepared before attempting such a trek. Additionally, ensure that you follow the guidelines and procedures established by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) for visiting the VLT."},{"question":"Francouzské orgány zaprvé žádají, aby byla roční kvóta ve výši 108 000 hektolitrů zvýšena na 125 000 hektolitrů čistého alkoholu v souladu s trendy na trhu Unie s rumem.

Article: Speak confidently and think logically. Year 13 schoolboy Arunabh Prakash can't agree more. Anmabh is one of the five students that will represent New Zealand at the 26th World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC) to be held in Thailand from August 5 to l5 this year. \\"You've got to be persuasive, regardless of the fact that you believe in a topic or not,\\" says the 17-year-old. \\"There are a lot of speakers who are eloquent but find it difficult to think logically and then there are those who have a good argument but can't deliver.\\" Endurance is another quality he says one must have in the heated arena of expressing opinions and ideas. \\"There are times when you have to debate for five hours at a go and are completely exhausted. It's quite intense. You must have the energy to debate for long hours,\\" says Arunabh, who began debating in year 10. The WSDC is a debating competition in the world for high school students from different countries. It involves four prepared debates and four impromptu debates -- debates without specific preparations.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","response":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true. Both sentences describe the same action, which is initiating communication with someone at their place of work - a hospital. Although the language used to describe the action differs between the two sentences, the nature of the action remains the same. In Sentence 1, \\"One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working,\\" it is conveyed that contacting the hospital was among the initial actions taken by the speaker. It indicates that the person made the call to the hospital, where the person referred to as 'she', was employed. In Sentence 2, \\"The very first thing I did was to contact her at the hospital,\\" the speaker indicates that the immediate action they took was to get in touch with 'her' at the hospital. This sentence could imply a stronger sense of urgency or immediacy than Sentence 1, as it specifies this action as the 'very first' thing, rather than simply 'one of the first' things. However, the difference in this sense of urgency or immediacy doesn't affect the fact that the two sentences inherently describe the same action. In conclusion, if it is true that the individual did ring up the hospital where 'she' was working as one of their first actions (as told in Sentence 1), then it is also true that the very first thing they did was to contact her at the hospital (as told in Sentence 2). These two actions are one and the same, described differently."},{"question":"For the first part of the process, you will need to scorch the tomatoes at a temperature of 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Preheat the oven to that temperature first. Meanwhile, prepare two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper. You could also spray the baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray if you do not want to use foil or parchment paper, but note that foil and parchment paper will make it easier for you to clean up later on. Use a rimmed baking sheet so that the excess juices and liquid produced during the process will be contained instead of dripping off into your oven. The tomatoes will need to be washed, dried, cored, and cut. Removing the seeds is an option, as well. Note that you should not skin the tomatoes yet. Rinse the tomatoes under cool, running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Cut a cone shape out of the top stem end of each tomato to remove the core. Use a small paring knife to do so. Cut the tomatoes into decent sizes. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, plum or roma tomatoes should be cut into halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices. You can remove the seeds, if desired, but the seeds and pulp contain a lot of flavor, so many prefer to leave them in. If you decide to remove the seeds, scoop out the seeds with your finger or with a kitchen spoon and leave as much of the pulp behind as possible. Arrange the tomatoes on your prepared baking sheet with the cut-side facing up. Position them so that each piece is about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart from the others. Do not stack the tomatoes or let them touch. Doing so could result in tomatoes that do not dehydrate evenly, so some may end up drying out or burning while others remain too moist to use. Popular seasonings for dehydrated tomatoes include salt, ground black pepper, herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle the tomatoes with your seasoning of choice generously, or according to taste. If you use herbs, go for options like oregano, parsley, and thyme. Both dried herbs and fresh herbs will work. You could also scatter fresh minced or chopped garlic over the tomatoes instead of using garlic powder. Drizzle a fine stream of olive oil over the tomatoes, coating them evenly. This oil enhances the flavor of the tomatoes and prevents them from cooking poorly. If using store-bought olive oil in its original container, place your thumb over the spout as you pour so that you can control the speed and size of the stream more easily. Use your hands or tongs to flip the tomatoes over so that the skin-side faces up. This is important since you will be scorching the tomatoes before you dehydrate them fully. By exposing the skin side to the direct heat, you prevent the tomato pulp from becoming too burnt too quickly. Place your tomatoes in the preheated oven and let them sit there for 30 minutes. When ready, the skins will show signs of some wrinkling and some browning. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and pour off the excess liquid that has begun to leak out from the tomatoes. Remove the skins by pinching them in between tongs and peeling them off. You can drain the liquid by tilting the pan and letting it run off into a bowl, or you could also suction the liquid away using a turkey baster. As soon as you pull the tomatoes out of the oven, you should reduce the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Do not finish roasting the tomatoes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Return the tomatoes to the oven and cook for another 3 to 4 hours. The finished tomatoes should look visibly dry with a few dark edges. Flip the tomato pieces cut-side up after the first hour of cooking. Drain or siphon away the excess juice every 30 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and let them cool at room temperature. When ready, you can store them in an airtight container or plastic bag, which can be frozen for up to three months. Alternatively, place the tomatoes in a bowl and cove them with extra-virgin olive oil. Wrap the entire bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate the tomatoes for up to 2 months. Summary:","response":"1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). 2. Prepare two baking sheets for the tomatoes. If possible, line them with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper for easy clean-up. 3. Wash, dry, core, and cut the tomatoes. If desired, the seeds can be removed. 4. Arrange the cut tomatoes on the baking sheets, spacing them appropriately to ensure even dehydration. 5. Season the tomatoes with your preferred herbs and spices, and drizzle with olive oil. 6. Flip the tomatoes so the skins face up, preparing them for scorching. 7. Put the tomatoes into the preheated oven for 30 minutes. 8. Remove the tomatoes, drain any excess juice, and peel off the skins. 9. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) and place the tomatoes back in for an additional 3 to 4 hours. Flip tomatoes and drain juice periodically. 10. Once dehydrated and slightly browned, remove the tomatoes from the oven and allow them to cool. 11. Store the tomatoes in airtight containers either in the freezer for up to three months or covered with olive oil in the fridge for up to two months. This process offers a clear method of transforming fresh tomatoes into long-lasting, flavorful, dehydrated tomatoes. Each step ensures the retention of the rich tomato flavor while enabling a safe and efficient preservation method."},{"question":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are some great differences between the traditional family and the modern family. The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation. Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes.

Serve with tortilla chips or as a topping for your favorite Mexican dishes. Why is salsa considered a Mexican dish? Salsa is considered a Mexican dish because it originated in Mexico, where it has been a popular condiment and staple in the cuisine for centuries. The word \\"salsa\\" in Spanish means \\"sauce,\\" and it is used as a base for many dishes or as an accompaniment to a meal, like a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, as a topping for tacos or grilled meats, or as a flavorful addition to soups or stews. Salsa has its roots in Aztec, Mayan, and Inca cultures, where tomatoes, chili peppers, and other ingredients that are now associated with Mexican cuisine were first cultivated. Over time, various regional variations of salsa developed throughout Mexico, reflecting the local availability of ingredients and the influence of different cultures. Answer to \\"Choose your answer\\": The answer is \\"no.\\" These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks for a recipe of a particular type of salsa (Abuelo's salsa).

The poison snake bit the girl and the doctor applied medication but it was too late; the","response":"venom had already spread throughout her body. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the doctor decided to take immediate and aggressive action to save the girl's life. Step 1: Administer Antivenom The first step was to administer an antivenom, designed to neutralize the venom in the girl's bloodstream. As each snake species produces different venom, the doctor had to identify the type of snake that had bitten the girl to obtain the right antivenom. Once identified, he quickly administered it through an intravenous line to ensure swift absorption into her bloodstream. Step 2: Manage Symptoms While the antivenom worked to combat the venom, the girl was showing obvious signs of distress, including difficulty breathing, decreased blood pressure, and swelling around the bite area. The doctor needed to manage these symptoms to prevent her condition from worsening. He gave her oxygen to help her breathe more easily, started an IV drip to stabilize her blood pressure, and applied a cold compress to reduce the swelling. Step 3: Minimize Pain and Infection Risk Snakebites can be exceptionally painful, and the risk of infection is high. To alleviate the girl's pain and reduce the risk of complications, the doctor administered an analgesic and prescribed antibiotics to fight off any potential infections. The antibiotics would help the girl's immune system combat any pathogens introduced by the snakebite. Step 4: Monitor the Patient With the antivenom running its course and symptoms managed, the doctor closely monitored the girl for any changes in her condition. This step was crucial as the effectiveness of the antivenom in neutralizing the venom could vary from person to person. By monitoring her vitals, the doctor would be ready to take further action if her condition worsened. Step 5: Provide Support and Aftercare As the girl's condition stabilized, the doctor began focusing on her recovery. He educated her and her family on proper wound care to avoid complications and scheduled follow-up appointments to track her progress. Counseling was also provided to help the girl and her family cope with this traumatic event emotionally. In conclusion, the doctor took a swift and comprehensive approach to treating the snakebite. By administering antivenom, managing symptoms, minimizing pain and infection risk, monitoring the patient, and providing support, he was able to save the girl's life and aid her in recovery. Though the situation initially seemed dire, the skilled intervention of the medical professional ensured a favorable outcome."},{"question":"Which is this about? It breaks your heart.

Martin Luther, a German professor of theology, composer, priest, and influential figure in the Protestant Reformation, displayed his \\"Ninety-Five Theses\\" on the door of All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany. This event took place on October 31, 1517, marking it as a critical moment in the history of Christianity and the Reformation. Luther wrote the \\"Ninety-Five Theses\\" as a response to the practice of indulgences promoted by the Catholic Church at the time. Indulgences were sold by the Church to reduce the punishment for sins committed by buyers or their loved ones. Luther believed this practice to be morally wrong and contrary to the teachings of the Bible. The document consists of ninety-five statements and arguments challenging the Church's assertions about indulgences and highlighting the importance of individual faith, personal relationship with God, and salvation through grace. Luther's posting of the \\"Ninety-Five Theses\\" on the door of All Saints' Church was an invitation for public debate. Although he initially addressed his concerns only within the Church, the document soon spread throughout Germany and eventually across Europe, sparking the Protestant Reformation.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention.

They had a highly-characteristic tri-lobed cross-section rather than the more usual circular cross-section. This was the result of moving most of the blimp's bracing wires inside the envelope in an attempt to minimise drag.

A traditional conditioner is applied every time you shower, just after you rinse out your shampoo. This type of conditioner works to repair the damage done by hot tools, chemicals, and general wear-and-tear that your hair experiences on a daily basis. Choose a type of conditioner that is advertised for your specific hair needs; whether you have curly and frizzy hair, dry and damaged hair, colored hair, fine hair, relaxed hair, or limp and lank hair, there is a specific conditioner that can help with each. Hop in the shower, and go along with your regular washing routine. You’ll condition your hair after you wash it, so give your scalp and strands a good scrubbing with your favorite shampoo. Focus most of your washing power on the scalp, being careful not to tug at your wet hair as you wash as this can damage the ends and cause more breakage. Use warm water to wash out the shampoo. Warm water is safer on your hair than hot water is. Be careful not to tug on the strands if you run your fingers through it. When your hair feels ‘squeaky’, you’ve rinsed out all the shampoo. If your hair is sopping wet, any conditioner you try to apply will run right off and won’t stick long enough to affect your hair. If your hair is very short, you probably won’t have to do much wringing. If, however, you have long hair, spend a bit of time getting as much water out of it as you can. Pour a bit of conditioner into the palm of your hand; the amount you need will vary depending on the length of your hair. A dime-sized amount is usually recommended for professional conditioners, while drug store brands may require more because they can be diluted. If your hair is very long, you may need a whole palm-full of conditioner. Run this through the ends of your hair, trying to apply it to every strand that you’re able. Your conditioner should be applied only to the ends of your hair, as this is the part that is damaged (it’s the oldest). Putting conditioner near your scalp and roots can actually clog your follicles, and slow hair growth/increase oil production. This step is slightly optional; the longer you wait and allow your conditioner to set, the more it will be able to do to improve the health of your hair. If you’re in a rush, you can rinse it out nearly immediately after, but it won’t make your hair as soft and shiny as it normally would. Try applying your conditioner, and then washing the rest of your body/face while it sets. Then when you’re finished (normally a minute or two later), you can rinse out your conditioner for maximum effect. Assuming you’ve turned the water temperature back up for comfort’s sake, turn it back down as cold as you can handle it. As aforementioned, the cold water is healthier for your hair. Spend a few minutes rinsing out the conditioner; if your hair still feels ‘slimy’, then you haven’t gotten it all out. When your hair is smooth and no longer feels super slippery, then you’re set! Wring out your hair and you’re done conditioning. Summary:","response":"This article outlines the process of using a traditional conditioner after shampooing, emphasizing the importance of choosing a conditioner based on hair type, applying it to the ends, allowing it to set, and rinsing with cold water for optimal hair health and manageability."},{"question":"The car had its turn signal one, where was it stopped?

Determine the sentiment in each part of the sentence. - The first statement has a positive sentiment due to the use of the word \\"lavish,\\" which implies something is very rich and impressive. - The second statement has a negative sentiment because it points out the film's lack of insight and understanding of the historical period and the artists involved. 3. Combine the sentiments to understand the overall sentiment. - While there is a positive sentiment in praising the production details, the emphasis on the film's shortcomings regarding insight and understanding ultimately gives the sentence a negative sentiment.

This will help us understand if the hypothesis can be correctly deduced from the premise or not. First, let us break down the premise. The statement \\"And yet, it fits in.\\" suggests that despite some unexpected or seemingly contradictory aspect, the subject (it) manages to fit or align with something. The subject (it) could denote any number of possibilities. It could reference a physical object, an idea, a belief, or an action taken in a given situation. Overall, the premise indicates that the subject, despite potential inconsistencies, finds a way to align with a given context. Now we will analyze the hypothesis, \\"I didn't move.\\" This statement is about the speaker's inaction, implying that the speaker has remained stationary. The subject here is the speaker, and there is no evidence of any unexpected behavior or inconsistencies. It could be interpreted as the speaker claiming that their positioning has not changed. With both statements analyzed, we can now explore the potential relationship between them. Given that the premise is rather vague and does not directly reference any specific context, determining the connection between the two statements can be tricky. However, since our goal is to investigate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must find a possible context where the two statements can be logically linked. Suppose the speaker is referring to their place within a group or an organization. In this context, \\"it\\" could signify the speaker's status or rank. Initially, it seemed unlikely for the speaker to maintain their position due to certain inconsistencies. These inconsistencies could be related to the speaker's opinions, beliefs, or actions that appeared to be contradictory to the group's views or principles. However, the premise's statement \\"And yet, it fits in\\" tells us that despite those inconsistencies, the speaker's status within the group still fits or aligns with the overall structure of the group or organization. With this established, let's assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"I didn't move.\\" Here, \\"I didn't move\\" could mean that the speaker hasn't experienced a change in position within the group or organization, despite the inconsistencies in beliefs, opinions, or actions. In this case, the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's place remains unaltered, which aligns with the premise's indication that the speaker's status still fits with the group. Based on this specific context, it can be inferred that the premise \\"And yet, it fits in\\" does entail the hypothesis \\"I didn't move.\\" Essentially, the premise suggests that despite potential inconsistencies, the subject (the speaker's status) fits within a given context (the group or organization), and the hypothesis indicates that the speaker has not experienced any change in their position. However, it is crucial to remember that there are many possible interpretations of the given premise, and choosing a different context might lead to different outcomes or conclusions. Additionally, the premise's vagueness could also contribute to alternative explanations, which may not support the hypothesis. Consequently, while the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis under this specific scenario, analyzing the statements from different perspectives could yield different results."},{"question":"italy 's president oscar luigi scalfaro returned here today following an one-day visit to sarajevo , according to local reports .

The Director said he hoped that the landscape would be declared as a heritage site next year in June. He also said it was important to protect Zambia's unique culture for education and entertainment. Chief Natural Heritage Officer Muyumbwa Ndiyoi said there will be a lot of benefits when the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site because it will attract many tourists and business investments will increase. Mr. Ndiyoi said the site will also benefit young people as knowledge will be passed down from generation to generation. He was reacting to a question from Nalolo District Labour Officer Jason Ngoma who wanted to know how the people of Western Province will benefit once the Barotse Landscape is declared a World Heritage Site. And University of Zambia Lecturer Charles Namate said there is a need for the site to be included on the World Heritage List because 50 years after its independence Zambia only has one heritage site, which is the Victoria Falls. Lecturer Namate said the Barotse Landscape was facing a lot of environmental degradation , and that's why there is a need to recognize the value of its landscape and the memories of dead kings.

Both nations have a rich history of collaboration and mutual support which must not be jeopardized due to the challenges of a single crisis. Furthermore, the publication appeals for a balanced approach and greater understanding of the complexities involved in managing an unprecedented disaster like the oil spill in the Gulf. It calls upon the leaders of both nations to work together on developing solutions to mitigate its impact, as well as learn from the mistakes made, which resulted in the catastrophe in the first place. British media emphasize that it takes international cooperation and collaborative efforts to address such a crisis effectively, rather than engaging in a blame-game that only serves to heighten tensions and further strains an already strained \\"special relationship.\\" Other British opinion-makers are also highlighting the potential ramifications of the White House's continued aggressive stance against BP, with The Times warning of vast implications for not just BP but for the wider British economy. The paper articulates concerns over billions of pounds being wiped off the value of British pension funds that have significant investments in BP, as well as the thousands of jobs that could be endangered due to collapsing share prices and mounting liabilities for the company. The newspaper calls on both President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron to take these potential consequences into account and act responsibly in their handling of the crisis, recognizing that both American and British interests are inextricably intertwined in this matter. Undoubtedly, the human and environmental costs of the BP oil spill have been colossal and devastating. But as two longstanding allies with a need for cooperation and joint action on various global challenges, it is essential that the United States and the United Kingdom maintain a level-headed approach, focusing on working together to address the situation in the Gulf of Mexico and - just as importantly - prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future. British media's defense of BP, while an expression of national concern, should ultimately serve as a reminder for both nations of the perils of losing sight of the bigger picture: the lasting implications of a situation that goes beyond BP and the Gulf Coast to encompass the future of the \\"special relationship\\" between two of the world's most powerful and influential nations."},{"question":"Question: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit.

Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

Title: Redemption through hope: A review of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" Introduction: \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novella by Stephen King, is a compelling drama that explores the themes of imprisonment, hope, and redemption in a masterful manner. Set in the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary, the story follows Andy Dufresne, a banker sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and her lover. Despite maintaining his innocence, Andy embarks on an arduous journey within the prison walls, making unlikely friendships and finding hope in the bleakest of circumstances. Plot Summary: In the early years of his imprisonment, Andy (played by Tim Robbins) is a quiet and introverted character who initially struggles to bond with his fellow inmates. However, after encountering and providing financial advice to a corrupt prison guard, he gains favor and is given responsibilities within the prison system. As a juncture in his character development, Andy befriends Ellis 'Red' Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), a wise inmate who has already served 20 years, and together they form a deep and enduring bond. Analysis: \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is an intricately woven tapestry of storytelling that takes on issues of institutional corruption, the human spirit, and the transformative power of hope.

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. - Prometheus the Fire-Bringer (Ancient Greek: , \\"Promtheús Pyrphóros\\") was probably the final play in the \\"Prometheia\\" trilogy traditionally ascribed to the 5th century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. - Ancient Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \\"cults\\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - In the Vedas, Indra is the king of Svarga and the Devas . He is the god of lightning, thunder, storms, rains and river flows. Indra is the most referred to deity in the \\"Rigveda\\". He is celebrated for his powers, and the one who kills the great symbolic evil named Vritra who obstructs human prosperity and happiness. Indra destroys Vritra and his \\"deceiving forces\\", and thereby brings rains and the sunshine as the friend of mankind. His importance diminishes in the post-Vedic Indian literature where he is depicted as a powerful hero but one who is getting in trouble with his drunken, hedonistic and adulterous ways, and the god who disturbs Hindu monks as they meditate because he fears self-realized human beings may become more powerful than him. - In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\". - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Prometheus Unbound ( Ancient Greek : , Promtheus Lyomenos ) is a fragmentary play by the Greek poet Aeschylus , concerned with the torments of the Greek mythological figure Prometheus who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity ( theft of fire ) , for which he is subjected to eternal punishment and suffering at the hands of Zeus . It inspired the play of the same title by Percy Bysshe Shelley . It is thought to have followed Prometheus Bound in the Prometheia trilogy attributed to the 5th - century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus . The text of the Unbound survives only in eleven fragments preserved by later authors . Nevertheless , these fragments , combined with prophetic statements made in the first play of the trilogy , allow the reconstruction of a broad outline . A lengthy fragment translated into Latin by the Roman statesman Cicero indicates that the play would have opened with Prometheus visited by a chorus of Titans . Though Zeus had imprisoned them in Tartarus at the conclusion of the Titanomachy , he has at long last granted them clemency . This perhaps foreshadows Zeus 's eventual reconciliation with Prometheus in the trilogy 's third installment . Prometheus complains about his torment just as he had to the chorus of Oceanids in Prometheus Bound . As the dramatis personae of Prometheus Bound erroneously lists Gaea , it has been suggested that she is next to visit Prometheus in this play , in a sympathetic role that echoes Oceanus ' turn in the first play . Finally , the faulty dramatis personae mentioned above and several fragments indicate that Heracles visits the Titan just as Io had in Prometheus Bound . Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been torturing Prometheus by eating his regenerating liver every day . Again mirroring events in the previous play , Prometheus forecasts Heracles ' travels as he concludes his Twelve Labours . The play thus concludes with Prometheus free from the torments of Zeus , but the Titan and Olympian have yet to reconcile . This... - Thunder is the sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a \\"clap\\", \\"crack\\", \\"peal of thunder\\", or \\"boom\\". - Aeschylus (or ; \\"Aiskhulos\\" c. 525/524 c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian. He is often described as the father of tragedy. Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in theater allowing conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the chorus. - Prometheus ( meaning \\"forethought\\") is a Titan in Greek mythology, best known as the deity in Greek mythology who was the creator of mankind and its greatest benefactor, who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind. - The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytaemnestra, the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and pacification of the Erinyes. This trilogy also shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theater trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\" won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. Many consider the \\"Oresteia\\" to be Aeschylus' finest work. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation. \\"Orestia\\" originally included a satyr play \\"Proteus\\" following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of \\"Proteus\\" has been lost. - The Prometheia is a trilogy of plays about the titan Prometheus. It was attributed in Antiquity to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian Aeschylus. Though an Alexandrian catalogue of Aeschylean play titles designates the trilogy \\"Hoi Prometheis\\" (\\"the Prometheuses\\"), in modern scholarship the trilogy has been designated the \\"Prometheia\\" to mirror the title of Aeschylus' only extant trilogy, the \\"Oresteia\\". Unlike the \\"Oresteia\\", only one play from this trilogy\\"Prometheus Bound\\"survives. Inasmuch as the authorship of \\"Prometheus Bound\\" continues to be debated, the very existence of a Prometheus trilogy is uncertain. To the extent that modern scholars postulate the existence of such a trilogy by a single author, the consensus holds that it comprised \\"Prometheus Bound\\", \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", and \\"Prometheus the Fire-Bringer\\", in that order. - In Norse mythology, Thor (from Old Norse Þórr) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as Þunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic þonar ), stemming from a Common Germanic *Þunraz (meaning \\"thunder\\"). - In Germanic mythology, Odin (from Old Norse Óðinn) is a widely revered god. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wden, in Old Saxon as Wdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wtan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym wanaz. - Prometheus Bound (\\"Promtheus Desmts\\") is an Ancient Greek tragedy. In antiquity, it was attributed to Aeschylus, but now is considered by some scholars to be the work of another hand, and perhaps one as late as c. 430 BC. Despite these doubts of authorship, the play's designation as Aeschylean has remained conventional. The tragedy is based on the myth of Prometheus, a Titan who defies the gods and gives fire to mankind, acts for which he is subjected to perpetual punishment. - In polytheistic systems there is a tendency for one divinity, usually male, to achieve pre-eminence as King of the Gods. This tendency is paralleled with the growth of hierarchical systems of political power, in which a monarch eventually comes to assume ultimate authority for human affairs. Other gods come to serve in a Divine Council or pantheon, usually linked by family ties from union of a single husband or wife, or else from an androgynous divinity who is responsible for the creation.

We can only hope a fair evaluation of the facts will eventually prevail and our right to worship in Russia will be legally restored.” The appeal was evaluated by three judges, as opposed to the single judge who ruled on the initial case. However, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, which has 175,000 members in Russia and had operated there since 1991, had little hope of success. A survey from the independent polling agency Levada, released last week, indicated that 79 percent of Russians supported the ban, though more than half of the respondents admitted they knew nothing about the case. The ban also had the powerful support of the Russian Orthodox Church, which enjoys a close relationship with President Vladimir Putin and counts more than 70 percent of the country's population as followers. The original decision can only now formally go into effect, though a Jehovah’s Witnesses spokesman in Russia told Newsweek in May that “most” of the group’s local chapters had already received documents from the tax department notifying them that they had lost their leases. That is far from the only negative consequence the group has faced since the April verdict declaring that its texts violate an anti-extremism law, effectively placing it in the same category as groups like the Islamic State (ISIS). Police have regularly disrupted group meetings both at the Kingdom Halls and in private homes. In one instance, a Danish citizen was arrested during a meeting at home and faces up to 10 years in prison. The verdict also has had a chilling impact across society. There have been numerous reports of harassment and violence committed against Jehovah’s Witnesses, including arson attacks. A report from the group released last week stated that instances of harassment and violence against its followers skyrocketed by 650 percent between March and April. In all, it found that there had been 128 cases of mistreatment, including some against children in schools. The ban has been widely condemned internationally, including by the United States and the European Union. In its 2017 report, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom elevated Russia to its highest tier of violators of religious freedom. Following Monday’s rejection of the appeal, the Jehovah’s Witnesses are expected to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. Yet even if the group is successful, Russia has no requirement to accept the verdict. “Regardless of what negative consequences this decision brings,” Semonian said, “Jehovah's Witnesses will continue to act within the law to secure their rights and support their fellow worshippers in Russia who must bear the burden of injustice.” This artcile has been updated to include further comments by a Jehovah's Witnesses spokesman. ||||| Image caption Russia's justice ministry argues that Jehovah's Witnesses pamphlets incite hatred Russia's Supreme Court has ordered the disbanding of the Jehovah's Witnesses on Russian territory. The ban came into effect after the court rejected an appeal by the religious group against a ruling in April which declared it to be extremist. The justice ministry had argued that the group distributed pamphlets which incited hatred against other groups. The group described the ruling as the end of religious freedom in Russia. The denomination says it has 175,000 members in Russia - a country where it was persecuted during the Stalin era. An estimated eight million people worldwide are part of the Christian-based movement, best known for going door-to-door looking for new converts. The ruling means that the group's headquarters near St Petersburg and 395 local chapters will close. It will be required to hand over all its properties, known as Kingdom Halls, to the Russian government. The group's Russia spokesman, Yaroslav Sivulsky, said that \\"religious freedom in Russia is over\\". \\"There were no real facts of any extremism on part of Jehovah's Witnesses. It's all about bad literature and intolerance. Now anyone who studies the Bible can be jailed,\\" he said, quoted by Newsweek magazine. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Russian authorities are clamping down on extremism nationwide One pamphlet distributed by the group quoted the novelist Leo Tolstoy as describing the doctrine of the Russian Orthodox Church as superstition and sorcery. Officials have accused the religion of destroying families, propagating hatred and endangering lives. The Church had also joined calls for a ban. The Jehovah's Witnesses group was founded in the United States in the 19th century. They take most of the Bible literally and refuse blood transfusions. They are not seen by traditional Christian Churches as a mainstream denomination. Image copyright AFP Image caption The original Supreme Court ruling came in April this year During Joseph Stalin's reign of terror in the Soviet Union it was outlawed and thousands of members were deported to Siberia. Other Christian groups were also persecuted. As the Soviet Union collapsed, there was a revival of Christianity in Russia and the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses was lifted in 1991. But attitudes hardened again and in 2004 it was accused of recruiting children and preventing believers from accepting medical assistance. Human rights group Sova has argued that an \\"official repressive campaign\\" has been conducted against the movement for years and many of their members have been physically attacked. The Jehovah's Witnesses are expected to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, but Russia may well ignore any verdict in their favour. |||||Summary:","response":"Russia has banned Jehovah's Witnesses from remaining in the country, claiming they incited hatred against other groups. The group had appealed against the decision to the nation's supreme court, but the court rejected the motion, confirming that religious freedom in Russia was \\"over\\", according to the group's spokesman Yaroslav Sivulsky.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"Which European explorer discovered that the Chinese used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel?\\" Response: \\"Peking Man\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","response":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer is Marco Polo, who discovered that the Chinese used black stones, or coal, as fuel."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question In the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31–3, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38–7, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17–14 against the defending conference champion 1970 Minnesota Vikings season, thus setting up a matchup against the 1970 Dallas Cowboys season for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17–10, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the 1970 Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington (49ers), and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park.

Nonetheless, elephant shrews are not classified with the superficially similar true shrews, but are instead more closely related to elephants and their kin within the newly recognized Afrotheria; the biologist Jonathan Kingdon has proposed they instead be called sengis (singular \\"sengi\\"), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa. - Eutheria (from Greek -, eu- \\"true/good\\" and , thríon \\"beast\\" hence \\"true beasts\\") is one of two mammalian clades with extant members that diverged in the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the Late Jurassic. Except for the Virginia opossum, from North America, which is a metatherian, all post-Miocene mammals indigenous to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America north of Mexico are eutherians. Extant eutherians, their last common ancestor, and all extinct descendants of that ancestor are members of Placentalia. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek \\"mégalo\\" \\"large\\" + New Latin \\"fauna\\" \\"animal\\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over , over , or over a metric ton . This includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer, red kangaroo, and humans. - Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. The term \\"ground sloth\\" is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant \\"tree sloths.\\" However, this is a historical convention and should not imply that all extinct sloths were strictly terrestrial in nature. Their most recent survivors lived in the Antilles, where it has been proposed they may have survived until 1550 BCE; however, radiocarbon dating suggests an age of between 2819 and 2660 BCE for the last known occurrence of \\"Megalocnus\\" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,0006,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal. - Placentalia (\\"Placentals\\") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The placentals are primarily distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother where it is nourished via a placenta, until the live birth of a fully developed offspring occurs. - Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs. - The superorder Xenarthra is a group of placental mammals, extant today only in the Americas and represented by anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos. The origins of the order can be traced as far back as the Paleocene, as early as 59 million years ago in South America. Xenarthrans developed and diversified extensively in South America during its long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They had invaded the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 9 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange. Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans, such as ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres, became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Metatheria is a mammalian clade that includes all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals (such as sparassodontans). First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880, it is a slightly more inclusive group than the marsupials; it contains all of the living mammals with abdominal pouches (most female marsupials) as well as their more primitive ancestors and relatives. Metatherians are one of three main classes of extant mammals: monotremes (egg laying mammals like the platypus and the echidna), metatheria (or marsupials, which includes the three American orders (Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria) and the four Australasian orders (Notoryctemorphia, Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and Diprotodontia)), and the eutherians (or placental mammals) consisting of twenty-one orders, divided into four superorders. Metatherians belong to a subgroup of the northern tribosphenic mammal clade or Boreosphenida. They differ from all other mammals in certain morphologies like their dental formula, which includes about five upper and four lower incisors, a canine, three premolars, and four molars. Other morphologies include skeletal and anterior dentition, such as wrist and ankle apomorphies; all metatherians share derived pedal characters and calcaneal features. - The aardvark (; \\"Orycteropus afer\\") is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike other insectivores, it has a long pig-like snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a \\"least concern\\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - In common cladistic usage, a monophyletic group is a taxon (group of organisms) which forms a clade, meaning that it consists of an ancestral species and all its descendants. The term is synonymous with the uncommon term holophyly. Monophyletic groups are typically characterized by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies). - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \\"worm tongue\\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \\"anteater\\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae. - Euarchontoglires (synonymous with Supraprimates) is a clade and a superorder of mammals, the living members of which belong to one of the five following groups: rodents, lagomorphs, treeshrews, colugos and primates. - Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Southern Africa, where their Afrikaans names are gouemolle or kruipmolle (singular \\"gouemol\\" or \\"kruipmol\\"). They comprise the family Chrysochloridae and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of convergence. - Afrotheria is a clade of mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. They share few anatomical features but many are partly or entirely African in their distribution. This probably reflects the fact that Africa was an island continent through the early Cenozoic. Because the continent was isolated by water, Laurasian groups such as insectivores, rabbits, carnivorans and ungulates could not become established. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups were filled by tenrecs, hyraxes and elephants that evolved from the ancestral afrothere. This adaptive radiation may have occurred in response to the CretaceousPaleogene mass extinction. - A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Laurasiatheria is a superorder of placental mammals that originated on the northern supercontinent of Laurasia 99 million years ago. The superorder includes shrews, pangolins, bats, whales, carnivorans, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, among others. - Ungulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotami. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving. The term means, roughly, \\"being hoofed\\" or \\"hoofed animal\\". As a descriptive term, \\"ungulate\\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, from jungles, plains and rivers. - Atlantogenata is a proposed clade of mammals containing the cohorts or superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra . These groups originated and radiated in the South American and African continents , presumably in the Cretaceous . Together with Boreoeutheria , they make up Eutheria . The monophyly of this grouping was supported by some genetic evidence . Alternative hypotheses are that Boreoeutheria and Afrotheria combine to form Epitheria ( as generally supported by anatomical and other physiological evidence ) or that Boreoeutheria and Xenarthra combine to form Exafroplacentalia or Notolegia . Updated analysis of transposable element insertions around the time of divergence strongly supports the fourth hypothesis of a near - concomitant origin ( trifurcation ) of the three superorders of mammals . - Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order Cingulata, part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \\"armadillo\\" means \\"little armoured one\\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \\"ytchtli\\" , Nahuatl for \\"turtle-rabbit\\": \\"ytl\\" (turtle) and \\"tchtli\\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \\"armadillo\\" is \\"tatu\\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages. - Boreoeutheria (synonymous with Boreotheria) (Greek: \\"north\\" + \\"good\\" + \\"beast\\") is a clade (magnorder) of placental mammals that is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria (most hoofed mammals, most pawed carnivores, and several other groups) and Euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). It is now well supported by DNA sequence analyses, as well as retrotransposon presence or absence data. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Chalk is a soft, white, porous, sedimentary carbonate rock, a form of limestone composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint). 'atlantogenata' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'taxon rank'?

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been... Question: Why is the Cuban economy weaker than in 1985? === The answer to the above question is Select from: [+] not enough information [+] Because the Cuban Revolution had not occured. [+] Because Miguel Diaz-Canel was not president? [+] Because the Soviet Union no longer supports it. A:","response":"Because the Soviet Union no longer supports it. In 1985, the Cuban economy was heavily dependent on support from the Soviet Union, which provided subsidies, trade, and military assistance. This support enabled the Cuban economy to maintain a higher level of prosperity than it could have achieved on its own. However, with the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, that support abruptly disappeared, leaving the Cuban economy in a very vulnerable position. In the years that followed, Cuba faced a severe economic crisis, known as the \\"Special Period,\\" which saw shortages of essential goods, widespread poverty, and a decline in infrastructure and services. Although the Cuban economy has since diversified and recovered to some extent, it has never fully regained the strength and stability it had in 1985 when it was still receiving significant support from its communist ally."},{"question":"How can I remove double chin? How do you prevent a double chin? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","response":"Both questions address the issue of having a double chin, but they refer to two distinct aspects of the problem. The first question, \\"How can I remove a double chin?\\", asks for solutions to an existing issue. The second question, \\"How do you prevent a double chin?\\", concerns the preventative measures one can take to avoid developing a double chin. I will provide a detailed answer to each question for your better understanding. 1. How can I remove a double chin? To remove a double chin, you can try a combination of lifestyle changes, exercises, and treatments. Here are some suggestions to help you get started: A. Lifestyle Changes: 1. Maintain a healthy diet: Consume balanced meals that include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to help lose overall body fat and reduce the appearance of a double chin. 2. Drink water: Staying hydrated improves skin elasticity and can help you feel full, preventing overeating. 3. Reduce salt intake: Consuming too much salt leads to water retention, which can exacerbate a double chin. B. Exercises: 1. Neck tilts: Tilt your head back, looking up at the ceiling, and hold for 5 seconds. Bring your head back down and repeat 10 times. 2. Neck rolls: Slowly tilt your head to one side, then roll it in a circle from one shoulder to the other. Perform 10 rolls in each direction. 3. Tongue press: Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then tilt your head back and hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times. 4. Chin lifts: Tilt your head back, look up at the ceiling, and pucker your lips, lifting the corners of your mouth. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times. C. Treatments: 1. Kybella: This injectable treatment dissolves fat cells under the chin, leading to a more defined jawline. Consult a cosmetic dermatologist or plastic surgeon for more information. 2. CoolSculpting: This non-surgical treatment uses cold temperatures to freeze and eliminate fat cells under the chin. Speak to a professional about whether this option is suitable for you. 3. Liposuction: A surgical procedure that removes fat deposits from the chin and neck areas. Consult a plastic surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits. 4. FaceTite: A minimally invasive treatment that uses radiofrequency technology to tighten and sculpt the skin below the chin. Talk to a professional for more information. 2. How do you prevent a double chin? To prevent a double chin from forming, consider the following measures: A. Maintain a healthy weight: Engage in regular exercise and adopt a balanced diet to prevent excessive weight gain, which can contribute to the formation of a double chin. B. Watch your posture: Poor posture, especially while using a computer or smartphone, can weaken neck muscles over time. Strengthen your neck muscles by maintaining good posture and taking breaks to stretch your neck during prolonged periods of inactivity. C. Sleep with proper support: Use a supportive pillow that maintains your neck's natural curvature, avoiding strain on the neck muscles and preventing the formation of a double chin. D. Perform facial and neck exercises: Regularly engage in neck and facial exercises to strengthen and tone the muscles in those areas. In summary, while the two questions address the issue of a double chin, the first question is about remedying the existing problem, while the second seeks preventative measures."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person Bob meets in the barn? The O'Leary family are traveling to Chicago to start a new life when Patrick O'Leary tries to race a steam train in his wagon. He is killed when his horses bolt. His wife Molly and their three boys are left to survive on their own. In town she agrees to prove her skills as a laundress when a woman's dress is accidentally spattered with mud. She quickly proves herself and builds up a laundry business in an area known as \\"the Patch\\". Her sons are educated. One, Jack, becomes a reforming lawyer, but another, Dion, is involved in gambling. While washing a sheet, Mrs O'Leary discovers a drawing, apparently created by Gil Warren, a devious local businessman. Her sons realize that it reveals that he has a plan to run a tramline along a street that he and his cronies intend to buy up cheaply. Dion becomes enamored with a feisty saloon-bar singer, Belle, who works for Warren. After a stormy courtship they become lovers. Meanwhile, Bob, the youngest O'Leary son, who helps his mother, is in love with Gretchen, an innocent German girl. They meet in the barn watched by the O'Leary's cow Daisy and plan to marry. Mrs O'Leary approves of the match, but expresses disdain for the loose-living Belle. Dion and Belle bribe the local politicians to set up a saloon on the street where the tramline will pass. Dion makes a deal to support Warren's political career and carve up business in the town. However, Dion's dishonest practices lead to conflict with his brother Jack when one of Dion's cronies is arrested for multiple voting. Dion later decides to support his brother rather than Warren in the election, convinced he can cut out Warren altogether and reign-in Jack's reformist zeal.

Question: Who had more troops in Iraq in 2003, the United States, or the Kurdish militia? Context: After the lengthy Iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an American demand that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein leave Iraq, which was refused, a coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom fought the Iraqi army in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Approximately 250,000 United States troops, with support from 45,000 British, 2,000 Australian and 200 Polish combat forces, entered Iraq primarily through their staging area in Kuwait.

A Los Angeles judge refused a request to free the singer from custody on Wednesday so he could make his own way back from Washington. Brown, 24, was taken to Washington by U.S. marshals this month for trial on an assault charge, but that has been put on hold until the appeal of his bodyguard's conviction is completed. Brown has been on probation since 2009 when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty. He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last December. The arrest led to a revocation of Brown's probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial Brown is now \\"stuck between a rock and a hard spot,\\" attorney Robert Kalunian told Judge Victor Greenberg during a brief hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He has been locked up for 39 days and still has not had a probation revocation hearing, Kalunian said. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said she \\"strenuously\\" opposed releasing Brown now, arguing the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has \\"gotten worse.\\" The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was \\"the initial aggressor\\" in the incident, Murray said. A hearing was set for May 1 in Los Angeles to set a date for another hearing that could determine if Brown's Washington case warranted a probation revocation. It could be several months before his trial in Washington is held. \\"I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,\\" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington earlier Wednesday. \\"And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching. So all of this is much ado about nothing.\\" Chris Brown's freedom at stake with 2 cases The delay in Brown's Washington trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to Hollosy so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case. On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case. The prosecutors cited Hollosy's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity. Their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help Brown. \\"The cynic in me would say apparently it is not a search for the truth because if they wanted the truth they would give Hollosy immunity and allow him to testify,\\" Geragos said Wednesday outside court.

Premise: - Classic propeller-driven airplane. - Flies in the distance. - Two men. - Remote-controlled toy airplane. - Field in the foreground.

Two men: Both the premise and hypothesis include two men. 2. Aircraft type: The premise mentions a \\"classic propeller-driven airplane\\" and a \\"remote-controlled toy airplane,\\" while the hypothesis mentions a \\"jet\\" and a \\"toy plane.\\" 3. Action: The premise states that the men are playing with the toy airplane, and the real airplane flies in the distance. The hypothesis infers that the men are controlling a jet while a toy plane flies by. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. From the comparison, we can see that there are discrepancies between the premise and hypothesis, specifically regarding the type of aircraft involved and the action the men are performing. The premise indicates a classic propeller-driven airplane and a remote-controlled toy airplane. The hypothesis, however, introduces a \\"jet,\\" which is not mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis also falls short of specifying that the toy plane is remote-controlled. Additionally, the actions in the premise and hypothesis do not match.

In contrast, the hypothesis implies that the men control a jet (which is not mentioned in the premise) and does not clarify the men's interaction with the toy airplane.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help.

He amassed a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies. Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity. Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity. A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism. As we say in English, \\"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\\" The answer to this question is:","response":"What differentiates Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao from other wealthy Chinese individuals? A) They are the only billionaires in China B) They have both amassed their wealth through real estate and recycling businesses C) Their remarkable generosity in donating their fortunes to charity and education D) They were the only ones to accept the invitation to dine with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett Answer: C) Their remarkable generosity in donating their fortunes to charity and education"},{"question":"Premise: \\"A female tennis player dressed in light blue prepares to hit an oncoming tennis ball.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Male tennis player are not played in the game.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Question: A country was testing a new missile and gathering data about resistance under different conditions. They found out that the missile experienced low resistance when flying through light wind, and heavy resistance when flying through heavy wind. This led them to believe that the missile experienced a smoother flight through (A) heavy wind or (B) light wind Answer:","response":"The country, in their testing of the new missile, gathered data relating to the resistance experienced by the missile under various conditions, specifically focusing on the effects of heavy wind and light wind. In their findings, they observed that the missile encountered lower resistance when flying through light wind, whereas a higher resistance was experienced when navigating through heavy wind. In order to determine which of these two conditions resulted in a smoother flight for the missile, one must analyze the relationship between the resistance experienced and how it affects the flight of the missile. In general, smoother flights are characterized by low resistance or drag, allowing the missile to maintain its course and speed with minimal disruption. Considering these factors, it becomes apparent that the missile experienced a smoother flight when navigating through (B) light wind. The lower resistance encountered in this type of wind condition allows the missile to maintain its trajectory and speed more readily, resulting in a more stable and efficient flight performance. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the implications of this finding for the country's missile development program. Understanding the relationship between wind conditions and the performance of the missile can help refine its design and capabilities. For instance, engineers can optimize the missile's aerodynamics and control systems to minimize resistance and drag, enhancing the missile's overall performance under various wind conditions. In summary, the country's testing demonstrates that the new missile experiences a smoother flight through light wind, attributable to the lower resistance encountered compared to heavy wind. This knowledge can serve as a vital piece in optimizing the missile's design and performance, ensuring it remains reliable and effective under varying weather conditions."},{"question":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Ranging from €2.80 to €6 per person","response":"The given sentence without spaces is: Rangingfrom€2.80to€6perperson"},{"question":"Which entity is this text about? Woo was born Wu Yu-seng (Ng Yu-sum in Cantonese) in Guangzhou, China, amidst the chaos of the Chinese Civil War at the end of October 1946. Due to school age restrictions, his mother changed his birth date to 22 September 1948, which is what remains on his passport. The Woo family, Christians faced with persecution during Mao Zedong's early anti-bourgeois purges after the communist revolution in China, fled to Hong Kong when he was five. Impoverished, the Woo family lived in the slums at Shek Kip Mei. A CGI Mighty Mouse film was announced in 2003 although, as of September 2015, nothing has yet been produced. There have been rumours that Woo will direct a film version of the videogame Metroid, however the rights he optioned have since expired. Woo's next projects are The Divide, a western concerning the friendship between two workers, one Chinese, the other Irish, on the transcontinental rail-road, while The Devil's Soldier is a biopic on Frederick Townsend Ward, an American brought to China in the mid 19th century by the Emperor to suppress rebellion. Rendezvous in Black will be an adaptation of the drama/thriller novel of the same name, and Psi-Ops is a science fiction thriller about a telepathic agent, and a remake of Blind Spot. In May 2008, Woo announced in Cannes that his next movie would be 1949, an epic love story set between the end of World War II and Chinese Civil War to the founding of the People's Republic of China, the shooting of which would take place in China and Taiwan. Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about the American Volunteer Group, or the Flying Tigers. The movie was tentatively titled \\"Flying Tiger Heroes\\" and Woo is reported as saying it will feature \\"The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema.\\" It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner. Woo has stated that Flying Tiger Heroes would be an \\"extremely important production\\" and will \\"emphasise US-Chinese friendship and the contributions of the Flying Tigers and the Yunnan people during the war of resistance.\\" Woo has announced he will be using IMAX cameras to film the Flying Tigers project. \\"It has always been a dream of mine to explore shooting with IMAX cameras and to work in the IMAX format, and the strong visual element of this film is incredibly well-suited to the tastes of cinemagoers today [...] Using IMAX for Flying Tigers would create a new experience for the audience, and I think it would be another breakthrough for Chinese movies.\\" After the death of Japanese actor Ken Takakura in 2014, Woo announced his next film Manhunt, a film based on the novel by Juko Nishimura. The novel had previously been adapted by Junya Sato in 1976 as Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare, starring Takakura. Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Shu Qi were in discussion to star in the film. In March 2016, it was confirmed that Zhang Hanyu, Masaharu Fukuyama, and Qi Wei would be starring in the film. Ha Ji-won was additionally confirmed as being attached to the project.

Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982.

Federalism also finds expression in ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church). For example, presbyterian church governance resembles parliamentary republicanism (a form of political federalism) to a large extent. In Presbyterian denominations, the local church is ruled by elected elders, some of which are ministerial. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members. In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in political federalism, in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty. What happens in Presbyterian denominations?","response":"In Presbyterian denominations, a specific system of church governance is followed that resembles parliamentary republicanism, which is a form of political federalism. This ecclesiastical structure is built upon the concept of shared sovereignty between different levels of assembly within the church. The local Presbyterian church is governed by a group of elected elders. These elders can be ministerial or laypersons and collectively form the Session, which is the basic governing body of the local church. This group is responsible for making decisions and implementing policies for the local congregation. Each local church then sends representatives or commissioners to the next level of governance, called the presbytery. Presbyteries consist of several local churches within a specific geographical area. These representatives participate in the decision-making processes and policies at the regional level. Beyond the presbytery is the Synod, which is a group of several presbyteries. The Synod also has its own governing body and functions as a regional authority over the presbyteries within its jurisdiction. Finally, at the highest level is the general assembly, which serves as the national governing body. It is composed of commissioners elected by the presbyteries and is responsible for making decisions on theological and policy matters that affect the entire denomination. In this hierarchical structure, each level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members, while still allowing individual components a degree of sovereignty. This system allows for the smooth functioning and administration of the Presbyterian denomination, enabling collaboration, shared decision-making, and accountability across various levels of authority, while still maintaining autonomy at the local level."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Sydney was responsible for cropping all photographs submitted by clients.

They're a fairly nutritious food as they are rich in fiber and a good source of magnesium, copper, selenium, and zinc. If you're vegetarian or vegan, pumpkin seeds can be a healthy snack as they're rich in protein. Most people can eat pumpkin seeds without a problem, especially if the shells are fully removed. However, if there are small traces of shells remaining on the seeds, you may get a slight stomach ache. If you're serving pumpkin seeds to kids, it's a good idea to be extra cautious about removing the shell to prevent choking. There are many different ways you can prepare pumpkin seeds. One way is to fry them in olive oil. Spread out some olive oil over a frying pan. How much you will need depends on how many seeds you are frying, but it should be enough to coat the pan. Allow the oil to heat for a few minutes and then throw in your seeds. Cook the seeds over the oil until they begin to make a popping noise. From here, add about a tablespoon of table sugar. Continue frying until the seeds pop again. Remove the seeds from the heat, let them cool, and enjoy. You can also roast the pumpkin seeds in an oven heated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Then lay the seeds out on a baking pan. If you like your seeds plain, you can put them in the oven as is. Some people prefer to sprinkle them with curry powder, chipotle flakes, or cayenne pepper. Clove, cinnamon, or nutmeg can be used for sweet pumpkin seeds. Bake the seeds for about 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown.","response":"This article discusses the benefits and various ways of preparing pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds are a nutritious snack option, particularly for vegetarians and vegans, as they are rich in fiber, magnesium, copper, selenium, zinc, and protein.

(B) Moisten soil: While earthworms prefer moist environments, their presence is not responsible for moistening the soil. (C) Agriculture: Earthworms are indeed beneficial for agriculture by improving soil quality, but this option is too vague and does not specify the exact action that they perform. (D) To move people: Earthworms are not involved in the movement of people. (E) Relocation: Earthworms do not engage in relocation activities.

Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. and the situation: There are two signs in a bar that use noble gases to light them. Sign A and Sign B are both the same solid color and patrons always point them out as they are rather amusing signs. However, one customer has just come up to the owner and told him that Sign B has just turned off. Answer the following question: Does sign A or sign B have a higher energy level? Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information, we cannot determine which sign, A or B, has a higher energy level. The energy level depends on the type of noble gas used in each sign, which is not specified in the situation.

It's one of Phoenix' landmark gay bars, usually offers drink specials, offers after hours and has a massive amount of space to accommodate more people. However, much like Amsterdam it's notorious for the clique culture, though drinks are cheaper.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces:\\" with the following options: - animals - Plant reproduction - Most plants - peachleaf willow - Plants growth - haploid cells - spread flower seeds - rapid expansion The answer to this question is:","response":"haploid cells. Given the two facts provided, meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes, and gametes are haploid egg or sperm cells that fuse to form a zygote. We can understand that the primary objective of meiosis is to produce haploid cells, specifically gametes (egg or sperm cells), which are essential for sexual reproduction. Now, let's briefly analyze the other options and explain why they are not the correct answer: - Animals: Meiosis occurs in both animals and plants for sexual reproduction, so this choice is too broad and not specific to the process of meiosis itself. - Plant reproduction: Although meiosis plays a role in plant reproduction, it is not exclusive to plants and also occurs in animals. - Most plants: This choice has the same issue as \\"Plant reproduction,\\" as it is too broad and does not specifically address the product of meiosis. - Peachleaf willow: This is a specific type of plant, and the answer should encompass what meiosis produces in general for both animals and plants. - Plant growth: This process is mainly related to mitosis, which is another type of cell division responsible for growth and repair, rather than meiosis. - Spread flower seeds: This is a method of plant reproduction through seed dispersal, not a direct product of meiosis. - Rapid expansion: This answer is vague and does not relate specifically to meiosis or the production of specific cells. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces:\\" is haploid cells, as this answer covers the production of gametes, which is the primary purpose of meiosis for both animals and plants."},{"question":"Here is an article: In this Jan. 24, 2015 photo, a Chinstrap penguin stands on a rock in Robert Island, in the South Shetland Islands archipelago, Antarctica.

The cartoon opens with an introduction of Petunia Pig; Petunia is shown as nervous, tripping on her lines and being unable to pronounce them correctly while on stage, leading an off-screen announcer to quietly tell her not to get excited. This causes her to go into an explosive rant and then the curtain closes on her and the main part of the cartoon starts. Porky is shown buying some flowers, candy, and then eventually a diamond ring. He proceeds to go over to Petunia's house and knock on the door, then Petunia goes to answer the door with her spoiled dog, Fluffnums. When she sees Porky, she is disgusted to see him so she disdainfully tells him to go away. This causes him to leave crying out of sadness and he then walks away, but Fluffnums sees the candy Porky has and alerts her to this fact. Petunia proceeds to run out after Porky and take him into her house, where she rips open the candy container and starts eating the candy. Porky tries to help himself to the candy several times but is constantly harassed by Fluffnums, who snarls and growls at him each time he tries to reach for the candy box. Porky finally gets a piece of candy, winks at the audience, and then finds out that Fluffnums ate it. He eventually tries to propose to Petunia, but as he is starting to do so, Fluffnums pulls a mean-spirited trick on Porky by pulling the rug out from under him. The fickle and selfish Petunia laughs at him, causing Porky to leave the house and walk off in shame.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Given the context: What will happen to Others? Possible answers: be sad about ash, be annoyed, be appreciative A:","response":"Based on the context provided, it appears that Ash has taken a proactive approach in addressing a given situation, using their knowledge and experience to assist others. In situations where an individual willingly shares their knowledge and resources to find solutions for their peers, it generally leads to a positive outcome for all parties involved. Considering this, let us analyze the possible answers and their likelihood: 1. Be sad about Ash: There is no clear indication that Ash's actions would result in others being sad about them. It is important to keep in mind that sadness is typically a reaction to circumstances that invoke feelings of loss, disappointment, or grief. Here, it seems that Ash's actions are of a constructive nature and their intention is to be helpful. As such, it would be unlikely for others to be sad about Ash given the context. 2. Be annoyed: Annoyance usually stems from dissatisfaction or irritation with another's actions or behavior. Since Ash is actively trying to remedy a situation and share their knowledge for the benefit of the group, their actions are seemingly quite positive. Therefore, it does not seem likely for others to respond with annoyance when they see Ash striving to help them solve their problems. It is important to note, however, that people's reactions can differ based on their individual experiences and perspectives, so there might exist a few exceptions who might get annoyed even in this situation. 3. Be appreciative: Appreciation is a common response to acts of kindness, understanding, and assistance. Given that Ash is making an effort to use their knowledge to help others with a situation, it seems natural for others to respond with gratitude and appreciation. Acknowledging the contribution of someone who puts time, effort, and intellect into finding a solution demonstrates that the individuals involved understand the value of collective support and a cooperative mindset. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the most likely response from others would be to feel appreciative of Ash's efforts in helping them address the situation at hand. Their actions demonstrate a willingness to be of assistance and share valuable knowledge, traits that often garner respect and gratitude from others. While different individuals may react differently, the majority should view Ash's actions positively and express their appreciation for the help received."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"D app always stop working after updating\\"","response":"To determine the star rating of the review \\"D app always stop working after updating,\\" I will assess the context, the sentiment, and the experience reported by the reviewer. 1.

Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"Step 1: Analyzing the premise. In the premise, there is a description of the following actions and elements: - A boy is wearing a pink t-shirt. - This boy is riding a bike over a sand pile. - Two other individuals (presumably friends) are riding bikes in the street. Step 2: Breaking down the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"The boy and his friends are outside.\\" Step 3: Evaluating evidence. Based on the premise, there are a few key pieces of evidence to evaluate: 1. Wearing a pink t-shirt: This detail does not necessarily entail that the boy is outside, as t-shirts can be worn both inside and outside. 2. Riding a bike over a sand pile: This detail strongly suggests the boy is outside, as it's more likely for sand piles and space to ride bikes to be found outside. 3. Two other individuals riding bikes in the street: This detail also supports the idea that the event takes place outside, as streets are typically outdoor locations, and the individuals are engaged in an outdoor activity (biking). Step 4: Comparing the premise and hypothesis. Considering the evidence from the premise, it is highly likely that the boy and his friends are engaging in outdoor activities, such as riding bikes over a sand pile and in the street. Step 5: Concluding whether the hypothesis is entailed. Based on the analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, given that the majority of the activities described (i.e., riding bikes over a sand pile and in the street) typically occur outdoors. Therefore, it can be inferred that the boy and his friends are outside."},{"question":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on flavien le postollec 's: - clubs - caps - position - currentclub - height - years - youthclubs - youthyears - birth date - name - birth place - goals Bio: flavien le postollec -lrb- born 19 february 1984 in abidjan , côte d'ivoire -rrb- is an ivorian-breton football -lrb- soccer -rrb- midfielder . he currently plays for oh leuven in the belgian second division . le postollec began his professional career with lille osc , and went on loan to fc brussels in 2007 . he moved to france at a young age .

The couple had two sons, Jake and Luke, both of whom work as directors on Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter, Jordan Scott, and divorced in 1989. His current partner is actress Giannina Facio, whom he has cast in all his films since White Squall except American Gangster and The Martian. He divides his time between homes in London, France, and Los Angeles. His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980. His younger brother Tony, who was also his business partner in their company Scott Free, died on 19 August 2012 at the age of 68 after jumping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge which spans Los Angeles Harbor, after an originally disputed long struggle with cancer. Before Tony's death, he and Ridley collaborated on a miniseries based on Robin Cook's novel, Coma for A&E. The two-part miniseries premiered on A&E on 3 September 2012, to mixed reviews. In 2013, Ridley stated that he is an atheist. Ridley has dedicated several of his films in memory of his family: Blade Runner to his brother Frank, Black Hawk Down to his mother, and The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings to his brother Tony. Ridley also paid tribute to his late brother Tony at the 2016 Golden Globes, after his film, The Martian, won Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. When asked by the BBC in a September 2014 interview if he believes in God, Scott replied: I'm not sure. I think there's all kinds of questions raised... that's such an exotic question.

Mary considered his to have loved her. Pick from: (A). unacceptable. (B). acceptable.","response":"To determine whether the sentence \\"Mary considered his to have loved her\\" is syntactically and semantically acceptable, let's break it down step by step. 1. Syntax: The sentence structure must follow the rules of grammar. \\"Mary\\" is the subject, which appears to be fine. The verb \\"considered\\" is transitive and requires an object. However, the object \\"his\\" is possessive and does not fit well as an object to the verb \\"considered\\" in this context. A better alternative would be a noun or noun phrase like \\"his love.\\" 2. Semantics: The sentence must be meaningful and make sense. Assuming the intended meaning is that Mary was thinking about whether someone has loved her in the past, the current sentence does not convey that clearly. It is difficult to comprehend the intended meaning of the sentence because of the problematic syntax and improper combination of words.

Five countries which received vCJD-risk blood plasma products should be named to stop the disease spreading, campaigners say. pick from the following. [1]. World [2]. Sports [3]. Business [4]. Science/Tech","response":"This topic is about [4]. Science/Tech. The article focuses on the issue of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)-risk blood plasma products and the need to identify the countries that received them. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is a rare and fatal human neurodegenerative condition caused by infectious prion proteins. The disease is linked to exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as \\"mad cow disease,\\" and can be transmitted through blood transfusions or contaminated surgical instruments. In this case, the primary concern is the use of potentially contaminated blood plasma products. Blood plasma is the liquid portion of the blood and plays a crucial role in various therapeutic treatments and medical procedures. It contains several proteins, including clotting factors, albumin, and immunoglobulins, which are essential for maintaining optimal health. Campaigners are urging authorities to identify the five countries that received vCJD-risk blood plasma products in order to prevent the spread of the disease. By identifying these countries, it would enable them to take necessary precautions and implement public health measures to limit the potential transmission of vCJD effectively. This may include enhanced surveillance and screening of blood donors and recipients, further research on diagnostic and detection methods, and improved protocols for handling and processing blood products. The identification of these countries is also vital for raising public awareness about the risks associated with vCJD. Although the disease is rare, it can have devastating consequences for those affected individuals and their families. Increased awareness can help to ensure that people who may have been exposed to contaminated blood products are vigilant about reporting any unusual symptoms to their healthcare providers. Moreover, naming these countries would underline the importance of maintaining strict regulations and adhering to best practices when sourcing, processing, and distributing blood products worldwide. The tragedy of vCJD transmission through blood products serves as a sobering reminder of the potential consequences of lapses in safety standards and the need for continuous vigilance in safeguarding public health. In conclusion, this topic is primarily related to Science/Tech, as it pertains to the medical and scientific aspects of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) and the importance of identifying recipients of potentially contaminated blood plasma products. By doing so, the spread of the disease can be better controlled, and the risk to public health minimized."},{"question":"Do these sentences have the same meaning?

Euroopan unioni, joka edustaa merkittävää osaa maailman taloudesta ja poliittisesta vaikutusvallasta, voi käyttää asemaansa edistääkseen ilmastonmuutoksen torjuntaa ja auttaakseen muita maita vähentämään päästöjään ympäristömme kannalta kestävällä tavalla. Kyse ei ole vain Euroopan unionin velvollisuudesta, vaan myös sen mahdollisuudesta ottaa vastuu globaalina toimijana ja edistää kestävän kehityksen tavoitteiden saavuttamista sekä mahdollistaa puhtaamman ja terveellisemmän maailman tuleville sukupolville. Yhdysvallat ja Kiina ovat kaksi suurinta hiilidioksidipäästöjen aiheuttajaa maailmassa, ja niillä on olennainen rooli ilmastonmuutoksen torjunnassa. Euroopan unionin on strategisesti tärkeää rohkaista molempia maita vähentämään päästöjään merkittävästi, jotta voidaan saavuttaa Pariisin ilmastosopimuksen ja kansainvälisten sopimusten tavoitteet, jotka koskevat päästöjen rajoittamista ja ilmaston lämpenemisen pysäyttämistä 1,5–2 asteeseen verrattuna esiteolliseen aikaan. Euroopan unionin on voitava neuvotella ja tehdä yhteistyötä Yhdysvaltojen ja Kiinan kanssa, tukeutuen sellaisiin mekanismeihin, jotka kannustavat niitä toteuttamaan päästövähentäviä toimia ja investoimaan kestävään teknologiaan. Nämä mekanismit voisivat sisältää mm. taloudellisia kannustimia, kuten investointeja, kauppasopimuksia tai tukia uusiutuville energialähteille, sekä saatavilla olevia sanktioita ja rajoituksia maita kohtaan, jotka eivät noudata kansainvälisiä sopimuksia. Lisäksi Euroopan unionilla on erityinen vastuu toimia esimerkkinä muulle maailmalle osoittaen, että päästöjen vähentäminen on mahdollista ja että päästöjen vähentämiseen liittyvät politiikat ja toimet voivat vahvistaa talouskasvua ja kehitystä.

What part of the scientific method involves measuring the growth of a plant over a one-month period? Available options: * analysis * observation * conclusion * hypothesis","response":"The part of the scientific method that involves measuring the growth of a plant over a one-month period is observation. The scientific method is a systematic approach used to investigate, acquire knowledge, and test theories. It generally consists of several steps or stages that guide scientists through the process of making discoveries. These steps may include the following, though the exact order and specific terms may vary depending on the field of study: 1. Observation: This is the stage where scientists closely observe a natural process or phenomenon—such as the growth of a plant—to gather detailed information about the subject. In this specific case, measuring the growth of a plant over a one-month period falls under the category of observation. During observation, scientists gather data by taking measurements, making calculations, or documenting patterns, which forms the basis for further questions and inquiries. 2. Question: Based on the observations made, scientists will fashion a question that seeks to understand the relationships and reasoning behind the observed phenomena. This question will usually focus on potential causes and effects, patterns, and possible explanations for the subject being studied. 3. Hypothesis: Once the question is determined, scientists propose a hypothesis, which is an educated guess that explains the observations. A hypothesis should be testable and falsifiable. In other words, it should be possible to conduct experiments that support or disprove the hypothesis. 4. Experiment: This step is where the hypothesis is put to the test through controlled experiments or trials. As experiment results are recorded, the quality of the data is crucial. Experimentation could involve tweaking different factors or variables within the experiment to see how the changes affect the results. 5. Analysis: After collecting the data from the experiment, scientists analyze it to determine if the results support or contradict the hypothesis. Analysis may involve the application of statistical tests, numerical calculations, or other means of interpreting the data gathered. 6. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the data, scientists will either accept or reject the hypothesis. The conclusion may also include the need for additional research or an acknowledgment of the limitations encountered in the study. If the hypothesis is rejected, the process is repeated, starting with the formulation of a new hypothesis. 7. Communication: Throughout or following the experiments and data analysis, results and conclusions should be shared with the scientific community. This collaborative aspect ensures that theories are subjected to rigorous peer-review, further tested, and either verified or adapted as new information is amassed.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Overboard Movie plot: The initial scenes establish that Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn), is a spoiled brat who always gets her way, the ultimate rich bitch, and the pampered wife of pretentious socialite Grant Stayton III (Edward Herrmann).Using Roman numerals after your name is Hollywood shorthand for \\"pretentious snob\\", and Grant is that, and self centered to boot, however, Joanna is far worse. She is not only snobbish but also idle, pampered, sharp-tongued, impossible to please and unfailingly rude to anyone she considers her social inferior, which is virtually all of the human race. To describe Joanna as unsympathetic is a huge understatement, a better description would be \\"prize bitch\\".When Grant's luxury yacht develops engine trouble, Grant is forced to put into the small Oregon coastal town of Elk Snout for repairs.While the huge yacht is in port, Joanna hires Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), a poor carpenter who has just moved to Oregon, to build better shoe storage for her closet in the yacht. Dean is a skilled craftsman, rather picky about what he uses, such as the wood that should be used to protect the leather from salt spray in a ship. Joanna is also not impressed by his taking so long, as he designed intricate shelves that confuse and annoy her.An early funny scene in the movie has Joanna lecturing Andrew the butler ( Roddy McDowall), on why the caviar he had just delivered her was no good, while Dean, standing in the background, has his tape measure pointing suggestively skyward.When the work is complete she refuses to pay him in a dispute over the quality of his workmanship, claiming that the closet is not up to her standards. In the ensuing argument Joanna loses her temper, pushes Dean overboard and throws his tools after him.The yacht crew has long ago gotten used to keep quiet and accept the guff from Joanna and Grant, despite that they have been treated like dirt, particularly family butler Andrew.After a typically stormy dinner that night, Joanna drops her wedding ring behind a seat on the deck.

We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \\"Absolutely not!\\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \\"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. and the situation: Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college.

Tripoli, with its metropolitan area, has a population of about 1.1 million people. The city is located in the northwestern part of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean and forming a bay. Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks. - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions. - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake. - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war . - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations. - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes. - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron. - George Downie (19 January 1778 11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada, Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance. He retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary... Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'military rank' with 'colonel'.

While there, the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches. The alien \\"Starman\\" (Jeff Bridges) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona. Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die. Sympathetic but still wary, Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards so he can continue the journey alone, but when she witnesses him miraculously resurrect a dead deer, she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him. However, they are pursued across the country by the authorities and, after nearly being caught, Jenny is shot and critically wounded by a police officer.

Directed by the visionary filmmaker, Olivia Martinez, this film is a testament to the power of the human spirit, a celebration of love, and a homage to the resilience of connections that transcend adversity. Set against the picturesque backdrop of the idyllic coastal town of Elsolara, the movie transports audiences to a world where the golden sun, with its warm embrace, is a character unto itself. The cinematography, courtesy of the incredibly talented Marco Russo, paints every frame with the mesmerizing hues of resplendent sunsets and sunrises. From the opening shot of foaming waves kissing the lustrous sands, to the closing scene of the glowing horizon bidding adieu to the day, the film envelops the viewer in a rich tapestry of emotions. The plot is centered around the lives of the two lead characters, Isabella (played by the enchanting Julia Ricci) and Mateo (portrayed by the ever-dynamic Daniel Stevens). They meet unexpectedly in Elsolara after facing unforeseen challenges in their lives. Isabella, a talented painter, arrives in town searching for inspiration amidst the chaos of her city life, while Mateo, an accomplished sailor, returns to the same location to find solace in the sea after a family tragedy. As fate brings them together, their initial encounters are filled with hesitation, reflecting the genuine awkwardness of burgeoning relationships. \\"The Radiant Sunsets\\" is a film that masterfully delves into the complexities of love. It shows the audience that even in the most turbulent times, love remains the most profound connection keeping the human spirit afloat. The attention to detail in the character development is extraordinary, making them feel authentic and relatable. Julia Ricci presents Isabella as a vulnerable yet strong woman, allowing her character to navigate tumultuous emotions with grace and depth. Daniel Stevens portrays Mateo with impressive skill, balancing the nuances of a man juggling his haunting past and present desires. The supporting cast adds vibrancy and depth to the film. The unforgettable characters – the lively, eccentric art studio owner Mariana (played by Luisa Alvarado), who supports Isabella's artistic journey, and Mateo's close friend and fellow sailor, the emotionally unshakable Diego (performed by Alejandro Gomez) – contribute to the richness of the storytelling as they challenge and support the lead duo. What makes \\"The Radiant Sunsets\\" a heartwarming cinematic experience is the underlying theme of hope woven delicately throughout.

Olivia Martinez has crafted a timeless piece of art that transcends the bounds of genre, serving as a quintessential example of the extraordinary impact films can have on their audience. \\"The Radiant Sunsets\\" is a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit and the transformative power of love wrapped in a visual spectacle, making it a must-watch for all those who seek warmth and inspiration in the magic of cinema."},{"question":"If \\"Two children are standing on a green metal fence.\\", can we conclude \\"Two boys are about to jump off a fence.\\"?","response":"No, we cannot conclusively infer that \\"Two boys are about to jump off a fence\\" based on the statement \\"Two children are standing on a green metal fence.\\" There are several reasons why this conclusion is not necessarily accurate: 1. Gender assumption: The initial statement mentions \\"children\\" without specifying their gender. It could be any combination of boys and girls. Concluding that they are \\"two boys\\" is an assumption that doesn't have any basis in the provided information. 2. Action assumption: The initial statement describes the children as \\"standing on a green metal fence.\\" It doesn't mention any specific action or intention such as \\"jumping off.\\" It is possible that the children are simply observing something, enjoying the view, or feeling the excitement of being up high. There could be numerous possibilities for their actions and intentions, and concluding that they are \\"about to jump off\\" is a leap beyond the information provided. 3. Surroundings and context: The original statement provides limited information about the context and surroundings of the scene. We don't know if the fence is high or low, situated in a secure or unsafe environment, or placed in a context where jumping off would be a feasible action. Assuming a particular scenario without any additional information is not an appropriate conclusion. 4. Motivation: We have no information regarding the children's motivations, thoughts, or reasons for standing on the fence. It is impossible to determine their exact intentions or actions without considering those factors. They might change their minds halfway through, or be motivated by a completely different intention altogether. In summary, while it is tempting to draw conclusions based on limited information, doing so often leads to assumptions that may not be valid. From the statement \\"Two children are standing on a green metal fence,\\" we cannot conclusively infer that \\"Two boys are about to jump off a fence.\\" It would require additional information and context to make such a conclusion."},{"question":"3 friends A, B, C went for week end party to McDonald’s restaurant and there they measure there weights in some order In 7 rounds.

Answer:","response":"Millennium Force was the first roller coaster to have a cable lift hill system."},{"question":"Answer the following question: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”. What does Harrison Ford do? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. He is an actor. B. He is an evolutionary biologist. C. not enough information D. He is a palaeontologist. Answer:","response":"A. Harrison Ford is an actor. Harrison Ford, born on July 13, 1942, is a renowned American actor and film producer. He gained widespread fame for portraying iconic characters such as Han Solo in the Star Wars franchise and Indiana Jones in the Indiana Jones series, including Raiders of the Lost Ark. His roles in these films, especially as Indiana Jones, often depict adventurous and daring characters, leading many fans to admire the courage and excitement of his characters. In the description you provided, your father, who was a palaeontologist, indeed had some similarities with Indiana Jones as both involved the study and exploration of the past. However, you later realized that your father's work primarily revolved around the creation and analysis of databases related to the fossil record of life, in contrast to Indiana Jones' thrilling adventures. As an actor, Harrison Ford's job is to bring such characters to life on the screen, captivating audiences with their personalities and stories. While he often portrays bold and adventurous characters like Indiana Jones, it is essential to differentiate between an actor and the roles they play in movies. In reality, Harrison Ford is not a palaeontologist, evolutionary biologist, or any other type of scientist; instead, he is a talented actor who has brought memorable characters to life throughout his career."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: How high over the Las Vegas strip was the roller coaster in the building formerly known as Vegas World?","response":"The roller coaster in the building formerly known as Vegas World, which was called the \\"High Roller,\\" was perched atop the 909-foot tall Stratosphere Tower.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

To elaborate, one must consider the intense nature of bike races encompassing long distances over diverse geographical terrains — from mountainous regions to flat terrains and everything in between. At the end of every race, it is a masterpiece to observe the resilience and determination that each rider displays. A race’s end doesn't just signify the finish line; it signifies the culmination of days, weeks and often months of extensive training and mental preparation. Thus, to merely state that the race concludes at the end is an understatement. The end of a race is actually a beginning — a beginning of rest, recuperation and preparation for the next race. A rider's journey doesn't just conclude with crossing the line; in fact, it paves the path for future events. The hard work, the exhaustion, the pain, the adrenaline, the pressure, all come down to that one moment of crossing the finish line. It is the instant when all the training pays off, and the rider savors victory or contemplates defeat. But whether the rider scores first place, last, or somewhere in between, each race teaches valuable lessons of endurance, tactics, patience and resilience. The rider learns and grows stronger with each race completed, reflecting on their performance and gearing up for the next challenge. Race ending doesn't simply mean the cessation of a biking event; it equates to the celebration of human spirit and willpower personified by each rider. The rider, therefore, isn't just a participant but a representation of stamina, grit and determination. Each race, each participant and each finish line is a testament to the tenacity of the rider and an ode to their strength and the sport's appeal. Thus, the sentence above does not merely incorporate 'end', 'race', and 'rider', it encapsulates the essence of what these words mean and the bond they share within the holistic ethos of cycle racing. The race is not just a challenge of speed; it's a test of endurance and willpower showcasing the strength of the rider. And the end is not just a finish line; it’s a symbol of accomplishment, persistence, and the continuous journey of growth and learning for the rider. In conclusion, the term 'end' captures the mood of culmination, 'race' brings in the vibe of thrill and competition, and 'rider' signifies the key person who ties all these elements together into a magnificent spectacle that reflects the human spirit's might. Such a depiction is probably the most justified explanation of race, rider, and end in a sentence."},{"question":"Chapter XLVI The Hours of Suspense ON Sunday morning, when the church bells in Stoniton were ringing for morning service, Bartle Massey re-entered Adam's room, after a short absence, and said, \\"Adam, here's a visitor wants to see you.\\" Adam was seated with is back towards the door, but he started up and turned round instantly, with a flushed face and an eager look.

This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army.

The symptoms appeared in the nose now, not the mouth, as the","response":"virus had mutated and adapted to find new ways to infiltrate the bodies of its unsuspecting victims. At first, the signs of infection seemed benign, barely noticeable to the casual observer. But this insidious pathogen was already plotting its course of devastation within the host. As the virus stealthily navigated through the nasal passages, the symptoms began to intensify. The once trivial sneezes and sniffs now turned into a chorus of echoing, congested breaths. The mucosal barriers tried their best to fight off the invaders, but the virus was relentless. It thrived in the moisture-laden environment, its numbers rapidly multiplying as it breached the body's defenses. In a matter of days, the human immune system was engaged in an unseen battle that eclipsed the visible symptoms. The nasal congestion evolved into a relentless, throbbing pressure that seemed to bear down upon the entire face. Sinuses, swollen and inflamed, sent tendrils of pain radiating into the skull and down through the jaw. The body's means of communication, the very words that should have conveyed the agony suffered by the host, were strangled and stifled by the virus. Sleep now became a treasured commodity, one that found itself increasingly scarce as the heavy, clogged breaths of the victims seemed to defy the natural rhythms of slumber. As the nights grew restless, the virus reveled in its triumph, further weakening its host by depriving them of the restorative power of sleep. Meanwhile, the virus began to expand its grasp on other aspects of the afflicted individual's life. Loss of appetite and a diminished sense of taste and smell wreaked havoc on their daily routines. Food, once a source of joy and sustenance, transformed into a bland and undesirable necessity, often yielding only grudging mouthfuls just to maintain basic bodily function. Physical stamina, too, succumbed to the ruthless pathogen. Bodies weakened by the pathogen were sapped of energy as they struggled to complete even the most mundane tasks. The emotional toll was not to be underestimated either. The isolation brought on by the fear of contagion and the constant barrage of bleak news reports stoked the flames of anxiety and depression, eating away at the very core of the victims' psychological well-being. This vicious cycle exacerbated the virus's impact, as a weakened mental state only served to further dampen the body's ability to fend off the infection. As the scientific community raced to develop a vaccine that would stem the tide of devastation, the virus continued its relentless spread. Communities around the world found themselves grappling with evolving protocols for social interaction, grappling with this unwelcome intruder that had invaded their lives. Yet, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, the indomitable human spirit continued to fight, determined to reclaim its control over the health and well-being of its people. Healthcare professionals, essential workers, and researchers worked tirelessly to confront the virus, and communities banded together in their efforts to provide support to their fellow citizens. The pervasive darkness cast by the virus was, for some, a signal for the rekindling of unity and collaboration, sparks of humanity shining through even in the bleakest of times. As the battle against the virus continues, the legacy of this ordeal shall not be merely a testament to the losses suffered but a reminder of human resilience in the face of adversity. This chapter in history will eternally echo the courage and determination exhibited by humanity, as they once again demonstrated an unyielding spirit that refused to succumb to the relentless march of a viral invader."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. What might be the first step of the process? A:","response":"The first step in the process of a star evolving into a white dwarf involves its life cycle as a main-sequence star, during which it primarily burns hydrogen to produce helium through the process of nuclear fusion. I will provide a detailed explanation of the entire process, starting with its initial stage as a main-sequence star. 1. Main-sequence star: Stars are born from clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. Gravity causes these clouds to contract, which raises the temperature and pressure within the core of the cloud. When the temperature is high enough, hydrogen atoms begin fusing into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This is the beginning of a star's main sequence life stage, during which it maintains a stable size and temperature. 2. Hydrogen depletion: A star spends the majority of its life in the main sequence stage, fusing hydrogen into helium. Eventually, the star starts to run out of hydrogen fuel in its core. However, nuclear fusion continues in a shell around the core, where there is still hydrogen left to burn. 3. Expansion into a red giant: As the hydrogen fusion moves outward from the core, the outer layers of the star begin to expand, causing it to become much larger in size. The expansion cools the star's surface, giving it a reddish hue, which is why it is referred to as a red giant. During this stage, the star's core contracts while the outer layers continue to expand and cool. 4. Helium fusion: When the core of the red giant becomes hot and dense enough, it begins fusing helium into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. This process is short-lived compared to the previous hydrogen fusion and causes the core to heat up and expand again. 5. Final stages of expansion and gas dispersal: At the end of its red giant phase, the star has produced a significant amount of heavier elements, and its outer layers are so distant from the core that gravity can no longer hold them together. These outer layers start to drift away from the core, dispersing into space and creating a cloud of gas and dust known as a planetary nebula. 6. Core collapse: With the outer layers now dispersed, only the hot, dense core of the star remains. Gravity causes this core to contract further, leading to an increase in temperature and pressure. 7. Formation of a white dwarf: Once the core has collapsed to a size roughly equivalent to that of Earth, the remaining material becomes incredibly dense, with its atoms packed tightly together in a crystalline structure. At this stage, the remnant of the star is known as a white dwarf, which is supported by a quantum mechanical phenomenon called electron degeneracy pressure. Although it no longer undergoes nuclear fusion, a white dwarf is still hot, and it will cool down gradually over extremely long periods of time until it eventually becomes a cold, dark black dwarf. In summary, the first step in the process of a star evolving into a white dwarf is its life as a main-sequence star, during which it primarily burns hydrogen to produce helium through nuclear fusion. This is the beginning of the star's life cycle, which leads to various stages such as becoming a red giant, core collapse, and eventually forming a white dwarf."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence from the research paper and your task is to classify the given sentence into the following categories: Background (Why is this problem important?

Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Poker is a game that puts the participants' nerves to a severe test. This translation from French to English communicates the idea that poker is a challenging and mentally demanding game, where the players' emotional resilience and nerves are of the utmost importance. In the world of poker, it is well-acknowledged that the game not only requires skill and strategy, but also a capacity to remain composed under pressure. The players need to be able to maintain their focus and make the best possible decisions, even when facing high stakes or unexpected twists in the game. The game of poker, which is believed to have originated in the United States in the early 19th century, has grown to become an immensely popular pastime around the globe. Played in a variety of formats like Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven Card Stud, poker has evolved into a game that attracts players of all skill levels, from casual amateurs to professional competitors. In any form of poker, the key objective is to win the pot, which is a collection of bets made by all players during a single hand. This can be achieved through having the best combination of cards or by outmaneuvering opponents, such that they fold and abandon their claim to the pot. To accomplish this, poker players must employ a dynamic combination of tactics like bluffing, reading the other players' body language and betting patterns, and carefully calculating the odds. The concept of putting \\"participants' nerves to a severe test\\" is certainly a defining aspect of poker, as players must manage their emotions and remain calm even in the face of tension and unpredictability. Failing to do so can lead to suboptimal decisions or \\"tilting,\\" a term in poker jargon which refers to a mental state where players lose focus, act on impulse, and subsequently make poor choices. In conclusion, the translation of the given French sentence highlights the fact that poker is not just about the cards a player holds in their hand. It is a game that challenges mental fortitude, self-control, and adaptability. Being able to conquer these aspects while navigating through a hand can be the difference between victory and defeat in the complex and intricate world of poker."},{"question":"Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Love to see the chronicle of Alison's family Review: I am a big MEDIUM fan and this DVD set is a dream!

Answer: A:","response":"Positive"},{"question":"I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that I've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, I decided to give \\"Erendira\\" another look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film. The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother, played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas, forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico. The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. It's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments from previous viewers below... Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. The film moves at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway, it really is that compelling. Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: \\"El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba.\\" (\\"The world's not as big as I thought\\" - i.e., It's a small world.) This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.

In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered. Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly modern orogenic activity. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540 Ma. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of continental behavior was a unique to the Archean period?","response":"The Archean period lasted from approximately 4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago, and it is characterized by a unique type of continental behavior not seen in later eons. While the Proterozoic eon features well-documented processes such as rapid continental accretion, supercontinent cycles, and modern orogenic activity, the continental behavior during the Archean period is less understood due to the highly metamorphosed and altered nature of the Archean rocks. However, researchers have identified several key aspects that distinguish it: 1. Formation of the first continental crust: The formation of the first continental crust is a crucial aspect of Archean continental behavior. As the Earth's early crust cooled, it began to form distinct granitic rocks known as \\"Archean grey gneisses.\\" These gneisses formed the nuclei for the first continents, which then grew through a process of accretion. This early crust was much thinner and more mafic in composition than later continental crust. 2. Small proto-continents: During the Archean period, continental crust primarily existed as small proto-continents or microcontinents. These proto-continents were formed through a variety of processes including volcanic island arcs, intrusions of granitic magma, and continent-continent collisions. These small landmasses did not resemble the large continents found in later eons; however, they represented the first building blocks of continents. 3. Plate tectonics: It is widely debated whether plate tectonics operated during the Archean period, mainly due to the scarcity of preserved geological evidence. Some researchers suggest that plate tectonics in the Archean was different from later periods, possibly involving smaller lithospheric plates or limited plate motions. Others argue that modern-style plate tectonics may not have begun until the end of the Archean or during the Proterozoic eon. 4. Greenstone belts: Another unique aspect of Archean continental behavior is the presence of greenstone belts. These are linear zones of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks that are surrounded by older granitic continental crust. Greenstone belts are significant because they provide evidence of early crustal processes such as volcanic activity and sedimentation, which contributed to the growth and evolution of early continents. 5. High geothermal gradient: During the Archean period, the Earth's internal heat production was higher than it is today, leading to a higher geothermal gradient. This increased heat flow may have played a crucial role in the formation of the early continental crust and may have influenced the tectonic behavior of the proto-continents. In summary, the unique continental behavior of the Archean period mainly revolved around the formation of the first continental crust, the existence of small proto-continents, a debated plate tectonic regime, the presence of greenstone belts, and a high geothermal gradient. This behavior differs significantly from the documented processes in the Proterozoic eon and later periods, making it a distinctive aspect of the Archean period."},{"question":"How is \\"Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"1.

The three were arrested along with four others at the site. All seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein. The climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing. Watch protesters and banner hung from bridge » Dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in","response":"San Francisco when the Olympic torch arrives, emphasizing that the demonstration on the Golden Gate Bridge is just a glimpse of the overwhelming support and determination of those fighting for Tibet's freedom. He elaborated that the global community, including numerous human rights organizations, activists, and sympathizers, stand in solidarity with the Tibetan people who have been struggling against the oppressive Chinese regime for decades. These large-scale protests are aimed at raising awareness of the human rights violations, cultural erosion, and environmental damages inflicted upon Tibet and its people by China's autocratic government. Local authorities and event organizers in San Francisco are preparing for the Olympic torch's arrival by organizing increased security measures, engaging in dialogues with various protest groups, and establishing designated protest areas. They hope to ensure that both the Olympic torch-related events and the demonstrations take place peacefully and without significant disruptions. The city mayor has called upon San Francisco residents and participants to respect the spirit of the Olympics while exercising their rights to free speech and assembly. Protests in San Francisco are expected to attract a diverse group of participants, including Tibetan exiles, religious leaders, environmental activists, and human rights advocates, all joining together to call for a free Tibet. Numerous events are planned throughout the city, such as prayer vigils, marches, and art installations, to show the world that the cause of Tibetan freedom is alive and flourishing. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has responded by criticizing the protesters, accusing them of trying to politicize the Olympics and disrupt the Games' unifying spirit. Beijing has repeatedly claimed that Tibet is an integral part of China, dismissing accusations of human rights abuses and cultural oppression as distortions from Tibetan separatists and their supporters. As the Olympic torch makes its way through various cities worldwide, protests and demonstrations continue to follow, bringing attention not only to the plight of Tibet but also to China's broader human rights record and questionable environmental practices. These protests raise important questions about the role of international sporting events in highlighting and potentially impacting geopolitical issues. In conclusion, the three activists' Golden Gate Bridge protest serves as a powerful symbol of the imminent unrest and outcry that await the Olympic torch in San Francisco and beyond. It encapsulates the unwavering spirit and determination of countless individuals who are standing up against injustice and oppression in Tibet, hoping to foster change and create a better future for its people. The upcoming protests, driven by a passionate and diverse coalition, seek to elevate the voice of Tibet on the global stage and hold China accountable for its actions in the region."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Byron write other than The Prisoner of Chillon?\\" is in \\"In 1816 Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings.

From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works.

Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings.

Usage: \\"The average hourly rate in the Ogden area is lower than Frank Smith's hourly rate.\\" This meets the criteria because it is closely related to the content of the paragraph (Sent 5) and the question, but it does not truthfully answer the question. Part #2: Ensure the incorrect answer is closely related to the content of the paragraph. Usage: \\"Frank Smith charges slightly more than the average hourly rate in the Salt Lake area.\\" This incorrect answer is related to the content of the paragraph (Sent 5), but it is not true since Frank Smith's rate (50/hour) is actually much lower than the average rate in the Salt Lake area (up to 400/hour). Part #3: Pose a challenge for students to distinguish between the correct and incorrect answer. Usage: \\"Frank Smith charges 25 an hour for his services.\\" This incorrect answer might confuse someone who doesn't read the paragraph carefully, as it closely resembles the actual value, which is 50 an hour (Sent 4). Without reading the paragraph, a student might not know Frank's current rate. Part #4: Prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question correctly. Usage: \\"Frank Smith's hourly rate is the same as the average hourly rate in the Ogden area.\\" This incorrect answer requires a closer reading of the paragraph (Sent 5) to be eliminated, as it suggests that Frank's rate is equal to the average rates in the Ogden area. Part #5: The incorrect answer should not be trivial. Usage: \\"Frank Smith charges over 1,000 an hour for his services.\\" This incorrect answer does not meet the criteria, as it is too far off from the information in the paragraph (Sent 4) and could be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph."},{"question":"How is \\"From Bologna: motorway A1 exit Roncobilaccio and follow directions for Passo della Futa/Firenzuola.\\" said in Russian?","response":"In Russian, the phrase \\"From Bologna: motorway A1 exit Roncobilaccio and follow directions for Passo della Futa/Firenzuola\\" can be translated as: \\"Из Болоньи: автомагистраль А1, съезд после Ронкобилаккьо и следуйте указателям в направлении Пассо делла Фута/Фиренцуола.\\" To break down the translation: - Из Болоньи = From Bologna - автомагистраль А1 = motorway A1 - съезд после Ронкобилаккьо = exit Roncobilaccio (note that the description \\"после\\" means \\"after,\\" which makes the phrase more understandable in Russian) - и следуйте указателям = and follow directions - в направлении Пассо делла Фута/Фиренцуола = for Passo della Futa/Firenzuola Remember that when giving directions in a different language, it's essential to consider the typical traffic signs, road terms, and expressions in that language to make sure the translation is accurate and easy to understand for native speakers."},{"question":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","response":"Question: What is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen, and what is the significance of this process to life on Earth? Answer: The process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in supporting life on Earth, as it is responsible for producing the oxygen and organic compounds that many organisms, including humans, depend on for survival. In photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight through pigment molecules, specifically chlorophyll, which is found in organelles called chloroplasts within their leaves. The energy captured from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6), a simple sugar, and oxygen (O2). The photosynthesis process consists of two major stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs the light energy, which leads to the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These two molecules serve as energy sources for the Calvin cycle. During the Calvin cycle, CO2 is taken in and combined with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), a five-carbon sugar molecule, to form the six-carbon molecule, which subsequently breaks down into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). These 3PGA molecules are then converted into glucose, which provides energy for plant growth, development, and reproduction. Also, the glucose molecules can be combined to form more complex carbohydrates, like cellulose, which is used for building plant cell walls. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere and becomes an essential element for the survival of aerobic organisms, including humans and most animals, which rely on it for cellular respiration. In this process, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Besides its direct impact on the production of oxygen and glucose, photosynthesis plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting it into organic carbon compounds. This helps regulate Earth's climate by mitigating the greenhouse effect associated with increasing levels of atmospheric CO2. In summary, photosynthesis is a vital process that allows plants to generate glucose and oxygen – essential components for the survival of many organisms on Earth – while also contributing to the regulation of the planet's climate through the carbon cycle."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Pick your answer from: *negative. *positive.","response":"To understand the sentiment of the tweet, let's first decipher the meaning behind the words. \\"Sat with the Mother feeling podged\\" implies that a person is spending time with their mother and experiencing a sensation of fullness or bloating, which might be suggestive of having eaten a wholesome and satisfying meal. The sentiment of this tweet can be seen as both positive and negative, depending on how one interprets the situation. However, on deeper analysis, it can be concluded that the sentiment leans more towards positive. Here's the reasoning: Positive aspects: 1. Quality time - The statement suggests that the person is spending time with their mother. Spending quality time with family members generally constitutes a positive experience for most people, leading to a sense of happiness and bonding. 2. Satisfying food experience – Using the word \\"podged\\" can indicate that the person has eaten a filling, and possibly delicious, meal with their mother. The delightful sensation post a satisfying meal carries positive connotations in many cultures as it reflects a moment of togetherness and celebration during mealtime. Negative aspect: 1. Discomfort – On the other hand, the word \\"podged\\" denotes a feeling of bloatedness or discomfort that typically results from overeating. This may be viewed negatively by some individuals as it is a physical sensation that can be uncomfortable. However, considering that the positive components, such as quality time spent with family and the pleasure derived from a satisfying meal, outweigh the minor physical discomfort experienced due to the feeling of being \\"podged,\\" the sentiment portrayed in this tweet can be largely described as positive."},{"question":"If \\"A man using a large drill on a city building.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man with a drill is in the city.\\"?","response":"Yes, it does!

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Let me provide you with a more detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Where\\" can be translated as \\"Kde\\". 2. \\"the moonlight\\" can be translated as \\"měsíční svit\\". \\"Měsíční\\" means \\"moon\\" (as an adjective related to the moon), and \\"svit\\" means \\"light\\" or \\"shine\\". 3. \\"on\\" can be translated as \\"na\\". 4. \\"the Bosphorus\\" refers to the famous strait in Turkey, which is called \\"Bosporu\\" in Czech. 5. \\"is\\" can be translated as \\"je\\". In Czech, the verb \\"to be\\" (být) is used in the present tense as \\"je\\" for the third person singular conjugation. 6. \\"irresistible\\" can be translated as \\"neodolatelný\\". \\"Neodolatelný\\" is an adjective derived from the verb \\"odolat\\" (to resist), with the negation prefix \\"ne-\\" (not) and the suffix \\"-ný\\" to create an adjective meaning \\"not able to be resisted\\" or \\"irresistible\\".

Answer:","response":"The history of using silver in US coins has undergone several changes over time. To provide a comprehensive understanding of when silver was phased out in US coins, it's essential to discuss the major milestones in the utilization of silver in different denominations. 1. Silver in Half Dimes and Dimes: Half dimes, initially made from silver (.8924 fine), were first introduced in 1794. However, due to public dissatisfaction with the size, new half dimes made from .900 silver were introduced in 1837. Later, in 1873, silver dimes underwent a change in silver content, which increased slightly to .900 fine, and weighed approximately 2.5 grams. In 1965, silver stopped being used in these denominations, replaced by copper-nickel clad coins. 2. Silver in Quarters and Half Dollars: Quarter and half dollar coins initially were minted with .8924 silver content. This changed in 1838 when the silver content became .900 fine silver. The last year of silver being used in quarter coins was 1964, after which, in 1965, copper-nickel clad coins were introduced. For half dollars, silver content reduced to 40% from 1965 to 1970, and 0% silver content coins were introduced in 1971, marking the end of silver usage in half-dollar coins. 3. Silver Dollars: Silver dollars, such as the iconic Morgan dollar (1878 - 1904, 1921) and the Peace dollar (1921 - 1928, 1934 - 1935), were minted from 90% silver and 10% copper. The last circulating US silver dollar coin was the Peace Dollar issued in 1935. Though modern silver dollars like the Eisenhower series (1971-1978) and the Susan B. Anthony series (1979-1999) were made of copper-nickel clad, there were some special silver-clad collector versions released that never circulated. 4. Silver in War Nickels: The silver content in US nickels underwent an interesting change during World War II. From 1942 to 1945, nickels were minted with 56% copper, 35% silver, and 9% manganese due to nickel metal shortages during the war. These \\"War Nickels\\" were minted with 35% silver, but silver was removed from nickel coins after 1945, reverting to their earlier composition. In summary, the use of silver in US coins reached its end in regular circulation coins in the mid-20th century. The last circulating silver coins were dimes and quarters minted in 1964, half dollars containing 40% silver up until 1970, and nickels containing silver only during World War II. Silver continued to be used in some special commemorative or proof coins since then, but it no longer played a role in general circulation coins in the US."},{"question":"Ask a question about Detroit.","response":"Why is Detroit called the Motor City?"},{"question":"Read this: Although Germany used forced labourers in most occupied countries, Poles and other Slavs were viewed as inferior by Nazi propaganda, thus, better suited for such duties.

While ethnic Poles were subject to selective persecution, all ethnic Jews were targeted by the Reich. In the winter of 1939–40, about 100,000 Jews were thus deported to Poland. They were initially gathered into massive urban ghettos, such as 380,000 held in the Warsaw Ghetto, where large numbers died under the harsh conditions therein, including 43,000 in the Warsaw Ghetto alone.

I asked Calin Tariceanu, president of the Senate and leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), a junior coalition partner in the government. A former prime minister, Mr Tariceanu admits that the government's actions and the way they have been communicated have been clumsy but he insists that they were well-intentioned. He rejects the perception, widely held in Romania and abroad, that the conflict is a battle between corrupt officials and a society fighting against corruption. \\"I regret having to say this, but the judiciary in Romania is not independent, and this is the clear issue which has to be addressed in the future.\\" He paints a picture of prosecutors, especially those from the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA), running amok and teaming up with the secret services. Prosecutors work hand in hand with judges, he alleges, and infringe on the civil liberties of Romanian citizens in a way not seen since communist times. \\"The DNA and the intelligence services are now perceived as institutions which are not respecting the legal framework, are corrupt themselves, and are used as important leverage in the political fight in Romania,\\" he told the BBC. His argument is diametrically opposed to that of Laura Kovesi, head of the DNA, who insisted in a BBC interview on Saturday that the judiciary were independent and that her directorate prosecuted government and opposition figures alike. The DNA would have been crippled if the decree had come into force. One reason for the anger on the streets of Romania during the past days was the speed with which the government introduced the decree, with no chance for debate. The government will now rectify that, Mr Tariceanu said. The debate will be a wide one and civil society groups which have been active in the protests will also be invited to take part. Many of those taking part in the protests say the decree was tailor-made to get certain members of the present and past governments off the hook - most importantly the leader of the governing Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea. He has already been convicted once for vote-rigging, and faces new corruption charges. \\"If no-one is protected by it [the decree], why shouldn't we withdraw it?\\" Calin Tariceanu told Mr Dragnea. \\"And show the people that we are open and sincere and very honest? We don't have any reason to protect anyone.\\" The 54-year-old Social Democrat leader pondered his words, then agreed to scrap the decree. On Sunday night, large crowds gathered again in Bucharest, to celebrate their victory and warn the government not to try to push through similar amendments in future. The government wants to persuade its supporters that this is a strategic retreat, not a surrender. At the same time, it will try to persuade the public, and the European Commission, that there is a real problem with the balance of powers between state institutions in Romania. And that the prosecutors, the judges and the secret services should be reined in. This article was about:","response":"A government with a comfortable majority in the parliament may still act clumsily in its actions and communication due to several reasons, including an inaccurate assessment of public mood, internal disagreements, or responding to underlying political motivations. Such actions can sometimes be driven by conflicting interests among different members of the ruling coalition, diminishing the government's ability to act cohesively. Government officials might also attempt to protect aspects of their agenda that can hurt their image, such as individuals accused of corruption or other wrongdoings. In the case of Romania's government, Calin Tariceanu, president of the Senate, admitted that the government's actions were clumsy, but were well-intentioned. He argued that the judiciary in Romania is not independent and that the National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) is working with secret services, infringing on the civil liberties of Romanian citizens. However, this position is in direct conflict with the DNA chief, Laura Kovesi, who insists the judiciary is independent. This debate highlights a crucial issue in Romania's balance of power between state institutions and the growing perception that the country is fighting corruption within its government ranks. Widespread anti-corruption protests erupted over the government's attempt to pass an emergency decree that would have weakened the DNA's ability to prosecute corrupt officials. Due to public pressure, the government withdrew the decree and promised to engage in a wider debate, inviting civil society groups to participate. In summary, governments with comfortable majorities in parliament do not necessarily engage in flawless behavior due to multiple factors, such as inaccurate assessments of the public opinion, internal disagreements within the coalition, or underlying political motivations. In Romania's case, the government's actions reveal a struggle between corrupt officials and society's attempts to fight corruption, and highlight the battle for maintaining an independent judiciary."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Strength refers to being strong in various aspects such as physical, mental, or emotional. Strength is generally considered to be a positive and desirable attribute. 5. Sufficient refers to having or providing as much as needed. This denotes an adequate or satisfactory state, which is not necessarily bad, but it doesn't carry the positive implications of the other options. Step 2: Identify the option that is least likely to be considered bad for anyone. Among the given options, all of them except \\"sufficient\\" hold more positive connotations and are unlikely to be considered bad or negative for anyone. While \\"sufficient\\" is not necessarily a negative quality, it may sometimes imply that something is just meeting the minimum requirements, without necessarily being exceptional or robust. Step 3: Determine which option is least likely to be bad for anyone. Considering the analysis above, we can determine that \\"sufficient\\" is the least remarkable option among the list. However, all of these qualities can be considered positive, and none of them are inherently bad for anyone. They might be evaluated differently based on the context, but in general, they are not bad. Therefore, each option may be unlikely to be considered bad for anyone, with \\"sufficient\\" being the least positive among them."},{"question":"If I tell you that Blue pine releases oxygen during the day but not during the night, and ask you the question \\"what releases oxygen during the day but not during the night?\\", is the correct answer \\"elephants\\"? Choices: (A). Yes (B). No The answer is:","response":"(B). No The correct answer to the question \\"what releases oxygen during the day but not during the night?\\" is not \\"elephants.\\" The question pertains to a process of releasing oxygen, which is related to photosynthesis. Blue pine, which you mentioned initially, is a type of plant or tree, that releases oxygen during the day through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process where plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O) into sugars and oxygen (O2). This process is essential as it helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen which is necessary for life on earth. During the day, when sunlight is available, photosynthetic organisms can perform this process and release oxygen as a byproduct. However, during the night, when sunlight is not available, photosynthesis comes to a halt, and plants do not release oxygen. Instead, they undergo a process called respiration, in which they consume some of the stored sugars to get energy and produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Elephants, on the other hand, are mammals and not photosynthetic organisms. As animals, they rely on cellular respiration to produce energy and release carbon dioxide as a byproduct, both during the day and night. They do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis and cannot release oxygen in any part of the day. In conclusion, the correct answer to your question is not elephants, as they do not possess the capability to release oxygen during the day similar to Blue pines or other photosynthetic organisms."},{"question":"If 23m − n = p, then which of the following represents the average (arithmetic mean) of m, n, and p, in terms of m? Options: (A) 2m −1 (B) 4m (C) 6m (D) m/5 (E) 8m Stream of consciousness:","response":"We are given the equation 23m - n = p, and we are asked to find the average of m, n, and p in terms of m. To find the average (arithmetic mean) of three numbers (m, n, p), we add them together and then divide by 3: average = (m + n + p) / 3 Now, we need to rewrite the equation we were given to get n or p in terms of m. We already have p in terms of m: p = 23m - n So we need to find n in terms of m. We can do this by rearranging the equation: n = 23m - p Now we can substitute this expression for n into the equation for the average: average = (m + (23m - p) + p) / 3 Now we can simplify: average = (m + 23m) / 3 average = (24m) / 3 average = 8m So, the average of m, n, and p, in terms of m, is 8m. The correct answer is (E)."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given music product reviews in French language.

But, to fully appreciate this sight, one must understand the intricate processes behind it, as well as the roles each character— the brood, the duck, and the ducklings— have to play. Ducks, much like many other bird species, are known for their distinctive breeding cycle, comprising of courtship, nesting and brooding. Brood, in this context, refers to all the offspring that a mother duck takes care of at one time. It includes eggs that are yet to be hatched, as well as ducklings that have already ventured out into the world. As a mother, the duck has a primary role to play, which begins even before the formation of the brood. She chooses a mate, often bonding with him for life, and then finds a suitable place to nest. A typical duck nest can be a simple depression in the ground, lined with plant material and the mother's own downy feathers. Once she has laid her eggs, the incubation period starts, which lasts around a month, during which time the mother duck rarely leaves her nest, getting up only to feed herself. Her dedication ensures the successful hatching of her brood. After the ducklings hatch, they are not entirely helpless. They quickly dry off and are soon ready to leave the nest, usually within a day. This is when the newly hatched members – referred to as ducklings – become part of the active brood. Ducklings are precocial birds, which means they hatch with their eyes open and are covered in downy feathers. They can even swim and find their own food, although they still remain under the careful watch of their mother. The mother duck provides her brood with warmth and protection, and guides them to the best feeding spots. At the same time, she would round them up at the approach of danger, spreading her wings wide and calling the ducklings to gather under her protective spread. For the first few weeks, she closely supervises her brood, all the time teaching her ducklings valuable lessons on foraging, avoiding predators, and navigating their environment. So, the image of a mother duck leading her brood of ducklings in a line, though undeniably charming, is also a testament to her tireless parenting and the survival instincts of her ducklings. It showcases complex life processes and the continuation of species in its simplest yet most profound form. It stands as a powerful symbol of nature's intricate design, and leaves us with a renewed admiration for the humble, dutiful, and protective mother duck and her lively brood of ducklings."},{"question":"Generate a short summary this sentence: renault 's president on saturday reaffirmed his intention to close down a plant in belgium , despite a meeting with a belgian official trying to change his mind .","response":"Renault's president has maintained his decision to shut down a Belgian manufacturing facility, even after a discussion with a local government representative who attempted to persuade him otherwise."},{"question":"If He slapped the cover shut and stuck the sun-tipped awl where it would light as much of the orrery as possible., can we conclude that \\"The orrery needed a lot of sun light.\\"? pick from the following.

The premise simply states that Grand Rapids suffered a one-third reduction, but it does not specify in what aspect the reduction occurred. Before we can assess the validity of the hypothesis, we need more information to identify the nature of the reduction. A one-third reduction could potentially be applied to several aspects. Let's explore some possible scenarios: 1. Population: It's possible that the one-third reduction refers to a decrease in the population of Grand Rapids due to various factors such as migration, economic downturn, or natural disasters. 2. Economy: The reduction could be related to the local economy of Grand Rapids, such as a drop in income or employment rates, leading to economic decline. 3. Land area: Another possibility could be that Grand Rapids has lost one-third of its land area due to natural events like erosion or flooding, or due to changes in administrative boundaries. 4. Public Services: The reduction might also be associated with cuts to public services, such as education, healthcare, or safety programs, which could impact the residents' quality of life. 5. Environmental factors: The one-third reduction could also relate to natural resources, such as a decline in water availability, loss of forest cover, or a reduction in local wildlife populations. Given only the information provided in the premise, we cannot ascertain the nature of the one-third reduction.

Step 3: Recall the narrator's earlier statement The narrator says, \\"I don't want the children to have to stand there the whole time.\\" Step 4: Combine the context, emotions, and experiences to determine the reason Considering the children's anxious state and the fact that they are on a train, the narrator might not want the children to stand the whole time because they are worried about the children's well-being and comfort during the journey. Standing for a long time may make their anxiety worse, add physical discomfort, or cause them to become more tired or stressed. So the narrator wants the children to avoid standing the whole time to alleviate their anxiety and ensure their comfort during the train ride."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Persuasion Movie plot: The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root). Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds)âa naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell). Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.

Movie title: Banana Joe Movie plot: Bud Spencer plays Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port (hence his name). One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction of a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat impounded and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest. Unfamiliar with city life and only marginally literate, he falls prey to a con man named Manuel, who has a gift of the gab which has placed him in favor in several high positions, even with the country's President for his help in developing a remedy for a genetic defect in the Presidential family. Eventually Joe meets Dorianne, an attractive singer, in a bar owned by Torsillo, where he gets a temporary job as a bouncer. Torsillo also runs into Joe personally time and again, and after having seen Joe easily finishing off five of his toughest goons, the gangster boss has taken to jumping out of the next window in a panic the instant he lays an eye on Joe. In pursuit of his license, Joe finds out that he must get himself registered with the authorities in order to \\"exist\\" legally.

For a more eclectic look, consider stacking your books on the floor, in a dormant fireplace, or down the edge of your staircase. Once you’ve settled on a location and storage method, you can finally put away your collection. Place the books on your bookshelves or stack the books in a storage cube. Before you shelve or stack your books, you may want to clean and dust your storage unit. For convenience, frequently used books should be readily accessible. This is especially important if children will be using the books. If children are using the collection, store the books at their level. Instead of a traditional shelf, consider a storage system that would allow them to stack the books. Lastly, you may also want to store the books in the places they will use them the most, such as a playroom or bedroom. If you don’t have the space to display your entire collection, you may need to put some of your books in storage. To protect your books while they’re in boxes, follow these tips: Stack your books horizontally with the heaviest books on the bottom. To fill in gaps, insert books vertically. Never place a book spine down. If possible, try not to stack more than three boxes of books on top of each other. If your collection contains rare books, you may wish to take extra steps to protect these special items. It is good practice to apply all of these suggestions to your entire collection. Store your rare books out of direct sunlight. In addition to fading the book jacket, the sunlight will slowly deteriorate the book. Keep your books in their dust jackets.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Oct. 30, 2017, file photo, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington. US officials say stricter Trump administration... (Associated Press) PARIS (AP) — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday that he doesn't see the U.S. relationship with China worsening after a series of setbacks that officials said include canceling the Pentagon chief's planned visit to Beijing this month. Mattis said the U.S. has to learn how to manage its relationship with the communist nation. \\"There's tension points in the relationship, but based on discussions coming out of New York last week and other things that we have coming up, we do not see it getting worse,\\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Paris. \\"We'll sort this out.\\" U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press on Monday that Mattis had dropped plans to visit China amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning. Although the trip was never publicly announced, Mattis had planned to visit Beijing in October for two-plus-two security talks with his Chinese counterpart as well as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Pompeo's Chinese counterpart. The Pentagon has made no public statement about Mattis' change of plans. Relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated, as escalating trade disputes and tariff hikes have been exacerbated by a newly announced U.S. military equipment sale to Taiwan and some recent military operations. In past years, military ties have been somewhat stable, but a series of events this year have roiled the waters. At stake is President Donald Trump's effort to enlist China's help in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. China is North Korea's longtime ally and has tended to insulate the North from American pressure to disarm. Just last week Beijing canceled a Washington visit by the head of its navy and denied a request for a U.S. Navy ship to make a port visit next month at Hong Kong. China also protested a recent mission by nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bombers over the disputed South China Sea, calling the flights \\"provocative.\\" And on Sunday, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Decatur sailed close to Chinese-claimed islands in the South China Sea. Such freedom-of-navigation operations have been somewhat routine near man-made reefs and islands that China has militarized in the South China Sea. But Beijing vehemently objects to U.S. ships sailing within 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers) of the outposts. China's military buildup in the waterway, which has included placing airstrips, radar domes, missile systems and other military equipment on the islands, prompted Mattis in May to disinvite Beijing from participating in a multinational naval exercise in the Pacific. At the center of the tensions is a growing U.S.-China trade dispute. Each country has imposed tariff increases on the other's goods, and Beijing has accused the Trump administration of bullying. In recent days, however, China's anger spiked when the U.S. announced a 330 million military sale to Taiwan. And Beijing also opposes a U.S. decision to issue a visa ban and assets freeze on China's Equipment Development Department and its director, Li Shangfu. The U.S. action relates to China's purchase from Russia of Su-35 combat aircraft last year and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment this year. Those purchases violated a 2017 law intended to punish the Russian government for interfering in U.S. elections and other activities. As temperatures rose, the Chinese foreign ministry warned of \\"severe damage\\" to bilateral relations if the Taiwan sale goes through. \\"I just think it's part of reality,\\" Mattis said Monday. \\"We're two, as you said, great powers, two Pacific Ocean nations. We have various issues: diplomatic, economic, security. We're going to have to find ways to work them out. We will.\\" Two B-52s flew over the South China Sea last week in what the Pentagon called a routine mission. Separately, two B-52s also flew over the East China Sea, where China has declared an air defense identification zone and claims uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan to be a renegade province. Washington has no official relations with Taiwan's democratically elected government but is obliged by U.S. law to see that it has the means to defend itself. Mattis visited Beijing in June, becoming the first Pentagon chief to do so since 2014. He flew to Paris on Monday and is expected to meet with senior French leaders there, then head to Brussels for a meeting later this week of allied defense ministers. ___ Burns reported from Washington. ||||| (CNN) A US Navy ship had an \\"unsafe\\" interaction with a Chinese warship Sunday while the US vessel was conducting a freedom of navigation operation near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, causing the US ship to maneuver \\"to prevent a collision,\\" according to US defense officials. \\"A (People's Republic of China) Luyang destroyer approached USS Decatur in an unsafe and unprofessional maneuver in the vicinity of Gaven Reef in the South China Sea,\\" Capt. Charles Brown, a spokesman for US Pacific Fleet, told CNN in a statement confirming the incident. Brown said the Chinese warship \\"conducted a series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers accompanied by warnings for the Decatur to depart the area.\\" He added that the Chinese destroyer \\"approached within 45 yards\\" of the front of the US ship, adding that the Decatur \\"maneuvered to prevent a collision.\\" \\"Our forces will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,\\" he said. The close encounter would give the ship's captains just seconds to react to any course change, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain who spent 12 years at sea. \\"This was very dangerous. Captains get very nervous when ships get closer than 1,000 yards,\\" said Schuster, now a Hawaii Pacific University professor. Minute rudder and engine speed corrections are needed to keep ships separated and even a slight miscalculation can result in a collision, he said. This incident comes amid heightened US-China tensions over a broad range of issues. Chinese ships often shadow US vessels during freedom of navigation operations but those interactions are usually considered safe. CNN reported Sunday the USS Decatur sailed within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands as part of what the US Navy calls freedom of navigation operations, which are meant to enforce the right of free passage in international waters. While the US Navy conducts such freedom of navigation operations all over the world, China is particularly sensitive about the operations when they come near areas where the Chinese government has built islands and established military facilities on disputed maritime features. \\"The US has been repeatedly sending warships to the islands and the adjacent waters in the South China Sea, which has seriously threatened China's sovereignty and safety,\\" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said Tuesday. \\"The Chinese military will resolutely perform its defense duties and continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard our sovereignty and the regional peace and stability,\\" Wu said. Schuster said China seems to be adopting \\"a more aggressive response policy\\" to US ships, emboldened in part by last year's collisions between US destroyers and merchant ships in the Asia-Pacific. Naval academics theorize the collisions that killed 16 US sailors have the Chinese navy doubting US seamanship skills and giving it confidence to \\"intimidate\\" US ship captains, Schuster said. Mattis cancels trip to Beijing In a sign of the increasing tensions, late last week US Secretary of Defense James Mattis pulled out of a planned visit to Beijing later in October, two US officials told CNN. Mattis had originally planned to visit the Chinese capital to meet with senior Chinese officials to discuss security issues. The last-minute cancellation of the unannounced trip has not been publicly confirmed by the Pentagon. Tensions have been growing across multiple fronts, from the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods to new sanctions announced against the Chinese military. At a news conference last week, President Donald Trump said his often-mentioned friendship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping may have come to an end. \\"He may not be a friend of mine anymore. But I think he probably respects me,\\" Trump said. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council last week Trump said the Chinese government was attempting to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections to tilt them against the Republicans. \\"They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade,\\" Trump said. \\"We are winning on trade. We are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election.\\" The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on 200 billion in Chinese goods on September 24, in addition to the trade measures already in place. The Chinese government responded in kind, with 5% to 10% tariffs on 60 billion in US goods. Following the new round of tariffs, Beijing called off planned trade talks with Washington, leaving no end in sight for the trade war. \\"How could you negotiate with someone when he puts a knife on your neck?\\" Chinese deputy trade negotiator Wang Shouwen said at a news conference last Tuesday, saying that resuming the talks would be difficult. In another sign of the growing tensions, the Chinese government canceled a port visit to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp , a US Navy amphibious assault ship, last week. It followed closely the decision by the US government to sanction Chinese military figures over their purchases of Russian combat aircraft and missile systems Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the \\"unsafe\\" interaction took place near the Spratly Islands. ||||| A summary of this is?","response":"A U.S. Navy cruiser, the USS Decatur, had an \\"unsafe\\" encounter with a Chinese ship while conducting a freedom of navigation operation in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.

He got in the car to chase it. When will the dog look smaller to Connor? (A) when he catches it (B) While chasing it. What is the most sensical answer between \\"While chasing it\\" and \\"When he catches it\\"? Answer:","response":"To determine the most sensical answer, consider when the dog would appear smaller to Connor: 1. While Connor is in the car, chasing the dog: - As Connor drives, the distance between him and the dog is constantly changing. Due to perspective, the dog would appear smaller if it's running farther from Connor and bigger as Connor gets closer to the dog. So, during the chase, the dog's appearance in size isn't consistent. 2. When Connor finally catches the dog: - At the exact moment Connor catches the dog, he would be very close to if not right next to the dog. Since the dog would be at a close range to Connor, the dog would appear larger compared to when it was running away. Based on these considerations, the most sensical answer is \\"While chasing it\\" (option B). During the chase, the dog may appear smaller to Connor when it is running farther away from him.

Her American-born mother, Judith (nee LeFever), was a writer and special needs tutor, and her French-born father, Gerard Louis-Dreyfus, chaired Louis Dreyfus Energy Services. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Leopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century. Her paternal grandfather, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, was president of the Louis Dreyfus Group. In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's Seinfeld. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally. On the \\"Notes About Nothing\\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \\"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\\" Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a \\"shocker\\", and that after being in both positions, it was \\"much better to win than to lose.\\" In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in. During her time on Seinfeld she appeared in several films, including Fathers' Day, opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated Deconstructing Harry.

Officials said it was common practice for the co-pilot to take charge. The plane was carrying 162 people from Surabaya to Singapore when it crashed. So far, 73 bodies have been recovered. Mardjono Siswosuwarno, head investigator of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSB), said the flight data recorder had provided a \\"pretty clear picture\\" of what happened in the flight's last moments. Capt Plesel was in charge from take-off until the cockpit voice recording ends, he said, adding that this was common practice. Investigators said the plane ascended sharply before dropping, rising from 32,000ft (9,750m) to 37,400ft within 30 seconds, then dipping back to 32,000ft. The process took about three minutes. Mr Mardjono said the plane was \\"flying before the incident within the limits of its weight and balance envelope\\" and that the flight crew all had correct licences and medical certificates. A preliminary report has been submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization, but has not been made public. The full report is likely to take about seven months, said the committee's chief Tatang Kurniadi.

His father, Jimmy, worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris Ann (nee Dudley), and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning, a small private school in the tradition of the one-room schoolhouse, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education. As a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity. When he was three, his mother bought a World Book Encyclopedia from a door-to-door salesman. Though Bomis had struggled to make money, it provided Wales with the funding to pursue his greater passion, an online encyclopedia. While moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of Objectivism in the early 1990s, Wales had encountered Larry Sanger, a skeptic of the philosophy. The two had engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales's list and then on Sanger's, eventually meeting offline to continue the debate and becoming friends. Years later, after deciding to pursue his encyclopedia project and seeking a credentialed academic to lead it, Wales hired Sanger--who at that time was a doctoral student in philosophy at Ohio State University--to be its editor-in-chief, and in March 2000, Nupedia (\\"the free encyclopedia\\"), a peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia, was launched. The intent behind Nupedia was to have expert-written entries on a variety of topics, and to sell advertising alongside the entries in order to make profit. The project was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. The idea was to have thousands of volunteers writing articles for an online encyclopedia in all languages. Initially we found ourselves organizing the work in a very top-down, structured, academic, old-fashioned way. It was no fun for the volunteer writers because we had a lot of academic peer review committees who would criticize articles and give feedback. It was like handing in an essay at grad school, and basically intimidating to participate in. In an October 2009 speech, Wales recollected attempting to write a Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton, but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who were to peer review it, even though he had published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as the moment he realized that the Nupedia model was not going to work. In January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a wiki by extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of its onerous submission process. Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck. Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia. Thus, the wiki project, dubbed \\"Wikipedia\\" by Sanger, went live at a separate domain five days after its creation. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what is nupedia","response":"Nupedia was an online project initiated by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger with the intention to create a free, peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia. It launched in March 2000 and was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to ensure its articles matched a quality comparable to professional encyclopedias. The aim was to have expert-written articles on a wide range of topics and monetize the project by selling advertising alongside entries. The writing and reviewing procedure was very structured, academic, and resembled old-fashioned methods, which was not appealing to many volunteer writers due to rigorous criticism and feedback they received from academic peer review committees. However, this top-down approach was seen as intimidating, hindering growth and participation. This eventually led the founders to consider the wiki model, which enabled simultaneous, incremental contributions from different editors. Nupedia, however, wasn't replaced but rather the wiki project was initiated as a separate venture, called \\"Wikipedia.\\""},{"question":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

Given the question \\"What does Carson need to do before this?\\", is \\"run away from Kai\\" a valid answer? Answer:","response":"No, \\"run away from Kai\\" is not a valid answer given the question \\"What does Carson need to do before this?\\". In this context, Kai is in need of help, and Carson is showing a willingness to extend a helping hand. If Carson were to run away from Kai before offering assistance, it would contradict the statement that Carson helped Kai. Instead, a valid answer should reflect the steps that Carson should take in order to effectively provide the support Kai needs. For instance, before helping Kai, Carson might need to: 1. Observe Kai's situation closely: Carson should pay attention to Kai's struggles in order to pinpoint the specific areas where assistance is needed. Listening to Kai and empathizing with his challenges will enable Carson to offer more relevant and targeted help. 2. Assess his own capabilities: Prior to extending any help, Carson needs to evaluate his own skills and resources to ensure that he is in a position to genuinely support Kai. If not, Carson could seek additional resources or collaborate with others who might have the necessary expertise. 3. Approach Kai tactfully: Carson should consider how to best approach Kai, as some individuals may feel embarrassed or overwhelmed when confronted with their difficulties. A gentle, non-intrusive approach can facilitate an open conversation and help create a comfortable environment for assistance. 4. Offer support in a respectful manner: Instead of imposing unwanted help upon Kai, Carson should ask him if he would like assistance and how he can be of service. This respectful approach would allow Kai to maintain a sense of dignity and autonomy in the face of his struggles. 5. Develop a plan together: Once Carson and Kai have identified the areas where support is most needed, they can create a structured plan of action. Collaboration between the two individuals can foster mutual understanding and help define attainable goals for Kai to achieve. In conclusion, \\"run away from Kai\\" is not a valid response to the question, as it does not reflect the caring and supportive context described in the initial statement. Instead, actions that promote empathy, understanding, and collaboration are more suitable answers to the question at hand."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: the blue dome of a church contrasts with the white buildings in the early morning","response":"In this sentence, the most salient words are: blue, dome, church, contrasts, white, buildings, and early morning.

Solve this instance: Lisa: Hi, Tim. So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend? Tim: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family. Lisa: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that? Tim: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake. Lisa: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years. Tim: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time. Lisa: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit? Tim: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities. Lisa: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely. Tim: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need. Lisa: A hotel sounds nice. Tim: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people. Lisa: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease. Tim: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park. Lisa: Wow. Tim: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important. Lisa: What about money? I have a credit card. Tim: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must. Lisa: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated? Tim: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated. Lisa: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely. Tim: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful. Lisa: Like Matches? Tim: Matches? (If) You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches. Lisa: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions. Tim: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with. Lisa: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ... Tim: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late., Question: What kind of emergency does the man NOT mention?

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days...

Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs).

This title captures the essence of the plot and the journey of the characters. Firstly, it refers to the game of baseball itself. A \\"curveball\\" is a type of pitch in baseball that is known for its sudden change in direction – not unlike the twists and turns encountered by these characters in their personal and professional lives. Secondly, \\"The Making of a Major Leaguer\\" highlights the progression of Ebby \\"Nuke\\" Calvin LaLoosh's character, from a hotshot rookie with haphazard pitching, to a more composed and potentially dominant pitcher. And while this refers to Ebby's development specifically, it could also hint at a second interpretation where Crash Davis is making an attempt of his own to return to Major League Baseball or \\"The Show\\", despite the odds. Thirdly, \\"curveball\\" often refers to an unexpected challenge or change in a situation, something all three of the main characters experience.

On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.","response":"What was the PATCO strike in 1981, and how did it affect the union movement in the United States during the period from 1955 to the 1980s?"},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: When inventor Mariko Tanaka (Hiroko Yakushimaru), who works for Hitachi appliances, accidentally re-engineers a washing machine for time travel, the Japanese government then convinces her to go back in time to prevent the passage of a fictitious law that would prevent the usage of real estate as collateral for loans, which was a major cause of the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : This isn’t one of those validation posts, though the title may seem that way. I’m being accused by my now ex of being the asshole. Yesterday was my birthday, so my boyfriend picked me up to go out to eat when he got off work. We noticed two dogs on the side of the road, wearing collars/tags, and I insisted we stop and try to save them, though he did not want to. I got out of the car and was walking toward them, when two men on bicycles came from the other direction, so the dogs ran across the road, and one was hit by a car. We managed to get the dog out of the road, and I asked my boyfriend if we could take the dog to the emergency vet. He agreed, unfortunately the dog died on the way. He subsequently was upset because he was worried about the interior of his car, which I did offer to have professionally cleaned. As I sat there crying, clearly very upset, and said that had I not stopped, the dogs wouldn’t have crossed the road and died, he just said, “probably.” No words of comfort. Though I do believe it was my fault, I was still traumatized. Had he been upset and crying, even if I disagreed about why, I’d try to comfort him. He took me to a bar after, though I just wanted to go home, and freaked out when he finished his drink and I asked him to take me home. I got out of his car and shut the door harder than I intended (100% my fault) and said I’d talk to him the next day. He peeled out, and I was worried he’d get hurt driving like a maniac. I asked him to let me know when he got home, and one hour later with no message, I kept calling and then got sent to voicemail. At least then I knew he was alive and not in a ditch somewhere. Either way, I sent a text breaking up with him, because he had been a complete jerk and then didn’t let me know he was home safe (I’d also like to point out, I’m not asking if I’m the asshole about the breakup. I shouldn’t have done it the way I did, that definitely makes me an asshole. But it’s also been coming for a few months. Every single person in my life told me they didn’t feel he was right for me, and this was just the last straw for me. We definitely had other issues, both his fault and mine. We just aren’t right for one another.) At the end of this, I think he’s an asshole because he cared more about his cars interior than the life of the dog, and treated me like I was the asshole for not caring about his car. Also for not letting me know and sending me to voicemail when I wanted to know he was home safe. And I will admit, I was upset and not looking at it from his perspective, which is why I had wanted to talk about it the next day, when we were both calmer. And he thinks I’m the asshole because he can’t really afford his car and wants to get rid of it as soon as he can, and the dog could have damaged his interior (which he did not I mention before we put the dog in the car, and the interior was not damaged, as the dog was not bleeding.)

Would \\"Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges , and this is because the procedure may vary.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"Blood urea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein metabolism. When proteins are broken down, they release nitrogen-containing compounds like ammonia. The liver converts ammonia into a less toxic substance called urea, which then circulates in the bloodstream. The kidneys filter blood and remove urea, excreting it in urine. Thus, blood urea is an indicator of both liver and kidney function. A measurement of blood urea is often performed as part of a routine blood test called blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test. The BUN test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea. Abnormal levels might indicate a problem with liver function, kidney function, or dehydration. As for your statement, \\"Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges, and this is because the procedure may vary,\\" it is a reasonable assertion in the context of blood urea testing. It is true that different laboratories may have slightly different reference ranges for blood urea levels due to variations in their methods, equipment, and the population they serve. The reference ranges are determined based on the average values observed within a particular population, and they help doctors interpret the test results to make informed decisions about a patient's health. It is essential for healthcare providers to consider the reference ranges provided by the laboratory that processed the sample to determine whether the urea level is within a normal, healthy range. In conclusion, blood urea is a waste product generated during protein metabolism, and its measurement through the BUN test indicates liver and kidney function. Different laboratories may have slightly varying reference ranges due to procedural differences and the population they serve."},{"question":"Context: Addison is responsible for delivering the local newspaper in her town.

You may have also felt the muscles in your body jerk when this all happened. Did you ever wonder why? This falling sensation, together with a body movement known as a \\"sleep start\\", is what doctors and scientists call a myoclonic jerk, and it usually happens right before going into deeper stages of sleep. Here's why doctors think the falling feeling and myoclonic jerks happen. When you fall asleep, normally your body temperature goes down and your heart start to beat just a little slower. This is because your brain signals your body to relax to prepare for sleep. When your muscles are relaxed, you go into the very first stages of sleep, but you're not sleeping too deeply yet.

Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh.

Options: - saudi arabia - europe - united states - book - monarchy","response":"To answer this question, let's examine each option and determine which one is the most accurate in describing where many colonial kingdoms originated: 1. Saudi Arabia: While Saudi Arabia is an influential country in the Middle East, it is not widely recognized as a source of many colonial kingdoms. So, this option seems less likely. 2. Europe: During the Age of Exploration and the subsequent colonial era, many European countries established colonies across the globe. Prominent colonial empires such as the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch originated in Europe. This makes Europe a strong candidate for the answer. 3. United States: While the United States did establish colonies after gaining independence from Britain (e.g., Philippines, Puerto Rico), it was itself a colony of a European power before its independence. So, it is not the origin of many colonial kingdoms. 4. Book: This option seems irrelevant, as a book is not a place where colonial kingdoms would originate. 5. Monarchy: This term refers to a form of government rather than a geographical location, so it's not suitable as an answer to where colonial kingdoms originated. Based on this analysis, the most accurate answer is Europe, as it was the source of many colonial empires and kingdoms that expanded their influence globally during the Age of Exploration and the subsequent colonial era."},{"question":"Context: Addison put the dishes on the counter after the dishwasher was finished.

The scene is quite intense; I find myself in the midst of a terrifying bug infestation, with my friend Paige and me fighting for our lives. Swarming around us are these hideous, yet oddly fascinating creatures, which seem to be a mix of an insect and a reptile. Their horrific appearance, with a mixture of scales, shell-like exoskeletons, and bug-like pincers, only adds to the palpable sense of dread that envelopes us in this unnerving situation. As I valiantly battle these creatures, I can't help but observe their lifeblood's unusual characteristic - a viscous, jelly-like green substance that oozes out of their heads as they meet their demise. I first noticed this when I crushed a bug's skull using a large stone; the head broke open like a particularly fragile cheese, leaving a ghastly mess that took all of my willpower not to retch at. The sight and the grumpy, guttural sound the creature produced were both indicators that it had breathed its last. Despite the urgency of the situation, I couldn't help but speculate about the alien biology of these creatures, so different from anything we had ever encountered. The green blood must have a purpose, or perhaps it indicates a completely unconventional biological system operating within their bodies. However, I had no time to dwell on these thoughts, as the priority at that moment was to save Paige. Upon killing the first bug, I immediately turned my attention to her. My heart raced as I saw that one of the bugs had caught up to her, its pincers perilously close to her, threatening to inflict unimaginable pain, and possibly even death. Fueled by adrenaline, I sprinted towards her, gripping the stone tightly, my eyes fixed on the repulsive creature looming over her. As I neared the pair, I realized that there was not just one, but rather two bugs posing a mortal threat to Paige. This harrowing realization only strengthened my resolve, and I swung the stone at the second bug, praying that my energy would hold out long enough to save my dear friend. The force with which the stone struck the bug was immense, and the aftermath was just as gruesome as the first - a burst of green, jelly-like blood splattering through the air, accompanied by that all too familiar grumpy sound that was beginning to become etched in my mind. With one bug down, I immediately turned to the remaining threat, my heart pounding in my chest, the lethal pincers now just inches away from Paige's delicate skin. With a surge of unbridled fury channeled into the stone, I swung once more, hoping against hope that this final effort would be enough to save her from these monstrous creatures. As the stone collided with the final bug, an intricate story of survival and friendship unfolded, underscoring the lengths to which we would go to protect those we love. The day's events would not be easily forgotten, and the images of grotesque creatures with their green, viscous blood would haunt our dreams for many a night to come. Nonetheless, we had persevered in the face of unimaginable horror, our bond only growing stronger as a result."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Options: - woods - forest - bicycle spokes - home - grass The answer to this question is:","response":"grass The most suitable option to use a stick to swat at what's growing in a field is grass. The reason being that grass is the only option that is appropriate for the context of the question, as it grows in a field and can be easily swatted with a stick. Woods and forest are not appropriate options because they refer to larger areas with trees instead of something that grows in a field that you can swat with a stick. Bicycle spokes, on the other hand, are completely unrelated to the question and are parts of a bicycle rather than something that grows in a field. Lastly, a home is not a suitable option as well since it is a structure built for living and not something that grows in a field that you can swat. Grass refers to any plants from the family Gramineae or Poaceae, which are monocotyledonous species that grow in various environments, including fields. These plants tend to have long, slender leaves with narrow, hollow stems. They are generally green, and their sizes may vary depending on the species of grass and the environment in which they grow. Using a stick to swat at grass growing in a field can be a simple recreational activity, often indulged in by children playing outdoors or even adults who are engaged in a light-hearted pastime. It can also serve as a way to keep grasses from overgrowing or to control the growth of unwanted grass species. Different techniques can be employed for swatting, such as swinging the stick horizontally to chop at the grass or using a sweeping motion to brush the grass aside. It is important, however, to ensure that swatting at grass does not cause damage to the environment or the surrounding ecosystem. Some grasses play a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility, preventing soil erosion, and providing a habitat for specific wildlife species. Additionally, some grasses may be cultivated to serve as livestock feed or used for agricultural purposes, such as hay production. In such cases, it is essential to exercise caution while swatting grass with a stick to prevent any negative impact on these beneficial aspects of grass growth."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Merritt Butrick for the following movie plot: The Federation Starship Enterprise returns to Earth following a battle with the superhuman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis.

The premise you shared talks about two things: 1. We want to find out who has the highest retirement income. Retirement income is the money people receive after they stop working when they're older. 2. The aged population, which means the number of older people, will become almost twice as many as there are now. The hypothesis, or the guess you want to check, is \\"The aged population has higher retirement incomes because of an increase in the stock market.\\" This means you think that older people have more money to live after they stop working because the stock market is doing well. It's important to know that the stock market is a place where people buy and sell little parts of companies (called stocks). When the stock market goes up, the value of those little parts of companies also goes up, which means people make money. Now, to figure out if your hypothesis is true, we would need to look at information about how the stock market affects the retirement income of older people. If we find that older people are getting more money from their retirement because the stock market is doing well, your guess might be right. If not, then there might be other reasons for the changes in retirement incomes."},{"question":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The 'Burbs Movie plot: On Mayfield Place, a cul-de-sac in the fictional suburban town of Hinkley Hills, Ray Peterson is trying to learn more about his mysterious new next-door neighbors, the Klopeks. Art Weingartner, the Petersons' other next-door neighbor, believes the Klopeks are murderers. Ray, Art, and veteran Lt. Mark Rumsfield watch Hans Klopek drive his car from the garage to the curb, then carry a large garbage bag from the trunk to the garbage can and bang it with a hoe. During the night, Ray watches the Klopeks digging in their back yard with pick-axes in a rainstorm. The following morning, Art checks the contents of the garbage truck as it is collecting the Klopeks' can. He is joined by Rumsfield and Ray, but they find no human remains. Bonnie Rumsfield finds neighbor Walter Seznick's dog running loose and wonders if Walter went away. Ray, Art, Bonnie and Ricky Butler go to Walter's house, finding his toupee in the kitchen. Ray collects the dog and leaves a note for Walter explaining the situation. The following night, Ray and Art have a meeting in the Petersons' basement and theorize about Walter's disappearance. Carol, Ray's wife, grows tired of her friends snooping around the Klopeks' home and she requests that she, Ray, and the Rumsfields pay the Klopeks a visit, meeting Hans, Reuben, and Werner while Art peeks around in the backyard. Later that evening, Ray reveals to Art and Rumsfield that he found Walter's toupee in the Klopeks' basement, which he previously slipped through Walter's mailslot. Ray and the others are convinced the Klopeks have murdered Walter, and the trio agree to investigate the Klopeks' backyard when the owners leave in the morning. The next day, Carol and son Dave go to visit Carol's sister, leaving Ray to explore the Klopeks' place. After Art disables the Klopeks' security system, he and Ray enter the yard and begin digging while Rumsfield stands guard on his roof. After hours of digging and finding nothing, Ray and Art enter the house, where they discover what they believe to be a crematorium.... Answer:","response":"Walter Seznick is Ray Peterson's neighbor in the movie titled \\"The 'Burbs.\\" The movie's plot revolves around the mysterious new neighbors, the Klopeks, who move in next to Ray, and the increasing suspicion that they may be involved in criminal activities. This suspicion is fueled by Art Weingartner, Ray's other next-door neighbor, who believes that the Klopeks are murderers. Throughout the movie, the neighborhood residents, including Ray, Art, and Lt. Mark Rumsfield, become increasingly convinced that the Klopeks have murdered Walter Seznick, another neighbor, due to his sudden disappearance and the subsequent discovery of his toupee in the Klopeks' home. This leads to a series of investigations and snooping by the neighbors as they try to find evidence of foul play. Additionally, strange behavior exhibited by the Klopeks, such as digging in their yard during a rainstorm, adds to the mystery and growing concern among the neighbors. The tension builds as the neighbors, with Ray at the forefront, become more persistent and daring in their attempts to uncover the truth about the Klopeks. They take considerable risks in their pursuit, including disabling their security system, breaking into their home, and conducting an extensive search of the Klopeks' yard, believing that they would find human remains or evidence of Walter's murder. The movie plays with the themes of suburban paranoia, sensationalism, and the fear of the unknown, as well as offering a critique of how easily people can become suspicious of their neighbors based on limited information and a preconceived notion of what constitutes \\"normal\\" behavior. In conclusion, Walter Seznick is a neighbor of Ray Peterson, the main character in the movie \\"The 'Burbs.\\" His mysterious disappearance and the circumstantial evidence found in the Klopeks' home become key plot drivers in a tale that explores themes of paranoia, fear of the unknown, and the potential dangers that may lurk beneath the surface of an ostensibly quiet suburban neighborhood. As you consider investing in this film proposal, consider how these themes and the film's blend of comedy, suspense, and exploration of the human psyche might resonate with a modern audience. Furthermore, assess whether the story, cast members, and production team are likely to yield a successful, high-quality film that would generate significant returns on your investment."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

Sometimes it can be hard to tell what kind of infection you have in your toe and if it is serious or not. It could be a simple ingrown toenail or a more serious infection that could spread into the rest of your body. Answer:","response":"[III] In order to tell the difference you should assess your symptoms. The signs and symptoms of a light infection include: pain and/or tenderness, swelling, redness, and increased warmth in the area. Now that you have assessed your symptoms, it is crucial to understand how to cure an infected toe. Depending on the severity of the infection, there are various treatments you can consider, but visiting a healthcare professional is always recommended for appropriate guidance. If the infection appears to be light and related to an ingrown toenail, you may begin by attempting some home remedies and self-care measures: 1. Soak your foot in warm, soapy water for 15-20 minutes at least 3-4 times a day. This will help to soften the skin around the affected area and reduce discomfort. 2. After soaking, gently massage the area to increase blood flow and promote healing. 3. Keep the area clean and dry. Make sure to wash the toe with soap and water daily and apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection. 4. Opt for comfortable footwear made from soft, breathable materials. Avoid wearing tight shoes or high heels for extended periods of time, as these can put additional pressure on the affected toe. 5. Trim your toenails straight across and make sure they are not too short. This will help reduce the risk of ingrown toenails and make it easier to manage the issue. 6. If the pain is causing discomfort, consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If you have followed these steps and your symptoms do not improve within a few days or if they worsen, it is important to seek medical attention. A healthcare professional may suggest some other treatment options, such as: 1. Lifting the nail: This is a procedure where the doctor gently lifts the ingrown portion of the nail away from the skin, allowing the nail to grow over the skin edge. 2. Partial nail removal: In more severe cases, a doctor may need to remove part of the nail. This can be done under local anesthesia, and a small portion of the nail is removed to reduce pressure on the affected area. 3. Total nail removal: If the problem persists and the infection is severe, the entire nail may need to be removed. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia and will require a longer healing period. 4. Oral antibiotics: If an infection is present, your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics to help combat the infection and reduce inflammation. It is crucial to follow your healthcare professional's guidance, as ignoring an infected toe can potentially lead to more serious complications, such as an infection spreading to the bones or even entering the bloodstream. Early intervention and treatment can prevent these severe outcomes and will speed up the healing process of the affected toe."},{"question":"Q:What is the answer for the question: What group is the scientist able to link to the car bomb? from the following article ? During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB.

He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players (the others being Maurice Rioli -1982, Nathan Buckley -2002, and Chris Judd -2005) to win the medal playing for the losing side. In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals. Martin Flanagan's representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel The Call is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions--they simply did what came naturally to them, \\"like a lot of artists\\". Ablett is the subject of the song \\"Kicking the Footy with God\\", released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album In Bed with My Doona. In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer. In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season. Question: What else pertains to his legacy?

Quinn places a box on the table, pulls out of this box a huge diamond, and says, \\"I stole it.\\" The movie flashes back to 1960, when Quinn was still employed as a manager at London Diamond Corporation. She is passed over for a promotion for the sixth time despite being intellectually superior to her male co-workers. When the company is in danger of losing a crucial contract with the Russians, Quinn saves the company with a simple solution, but the Russians will not proceed unless the arrangements are kept secret from everyone except senior management, which excludes Quinn. Quinn is to be terminated. The janitor, Mr. Hobbs, finds out this and warns her. He offers her a place in a plot: stealing enough diamonds to make them rich, but not enough to be noticed. However, Mr. Hobbs steals every single diamond, almost two tons worth, and holds them for a ransom of 100 million pounds. The head of the insurance syndicate from King's Row is forced to pay the ransom, leaving him financially ruined. Quinn never agreed to this and now finds herself trapped. The company hires a private investigator, Mr Finch, to keep the matter from going public. Mr. Finch keeps a close eye on Mr. Hobbs and Miss Quinn. Quinn wants to avoid jail time by giving the diamonds back but Mr. Hobbs refuses. When the president of London Diamond Corporation has a heart attack over the stress of the situation once leaked to Press, Mr. Finch is called away. Miss Quinn runs to the bathroom and cries uncontrollably. She pulls a handkerchief from her purse which held one of her earrings she had taken apart earlier. The diamond from the earring falls down the drain of the sink and into the trap underneath.

Trim off the top of the stalks where the leaves are. Make sure you remove all the leaves, as these are poisonous. Trim off the bottom inch (2.5 cm) of the stalks as well, where the rhubarb was touching the ground. Rinse the rhubarb under cool, running water. Use your fingers or a clean cloth to scrub away any dirt on the fruit. Rhubarb is fairly hard, so you can also use a vegetable brush to scrub it clean if you like. Lay the stalks on a clean towel and roll each stalk around to dry it. You can also dry the rhubarb in a salad spinner if you have one. Transfer the rhubarb stalks back to the cutting board. Chop each stalk into quarter- to half-inch pieces (6 to 13 mm). Smaller pieces are ideal for jams, pie fillings, and baked goods. Larger pieces are better for eating plain or making chunkier compotes. If you have specific plans for the rhubarb, consult the individual recipes to determine the right length for the pieces. Summary:","response":"This article is about how to prepare rhubarb. First, put the rhubarb on a flat surface and cut off the leafy tops and bottom part.

Context: Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

The main dish is to be Timmy (Matthew Lawrence), a young boy whom she has captured and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from a book she gave him, titled Tales from the Darkside. Lot 249[edit] In the first segment, Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, \\"Lot No. 249\\". A graduate student named Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) has been cheated by two classmates, Susan (Julianne Moore), and Lee (Robert Sedgwick), who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards.

Drogan is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound old man (William Hickey) who brings in a hitman named Halston (David Johansen) for a bizarre hire: kill a black cat, which Drogan believes is murderously evil.

James Blake told the New York Daily News that a group of five plainclothes officers slammed him to the ground and held him for 15 minutes on Wednesday. The police said in a statement that the officers mistakenly believed he was a suspect in a theft case. Once it was determined that Mr Blake was not the suspect, he was released. Mr Blake, 35, said he suffered a cut on his arm and bruises on his legs. He said the officers did not speak to him before they pushed him to the ground. \\"You'd think they could say: 'Hey, we want to talk to you. We are looking in to something',\\" Mr Blake told the Daily News. \\"You would think at some point they would get the memo that this isn't OK, but it seems that there's no stopping it.\\" Once the fourth-ranked player in the world, Mr Blake was set to make an appearance at the US Open for the Time-Warner Cable company. He retired following his US Open exit in 2013 after winning 10 singles titles in a career in which he also became the number one US player. Police said a \\"cooperating witness\\" mistakenly identified Mr Blake as being involved in \\"a ring dealing in fraudulently purchased cellphones\\". Racial concerns Mr Blake, who is black, said race may have contributed to the incident. All of the officers were white. However he said his primary concern was with the amount of force used. \\"In my mind there's probably a race factor involved, but no matter what there's no reason for anybody to do that to anybody,\\" he told the Daily News. The New York Police Department said it was investigating whether the officers used excessive force. The department has recently been involved in a number of high-profile cases involving accusations of police brutality. In the most prominent case, a man selling illegal cigarettes died in July 2014 after being subdued by several police officers. Eric Garner's violent arrest was filmed by a bystander. A decision not to criminally charge the officers led to widespread protests across the city. ||||| Former tennis player James Blake was mistakenly tackled and handcuffed by police Wednesday on a Midtown street. Police say the retired American star was misidentified by a witness cooperating with an investigation into fraudulent cell phone purchases. According to sources, detectives with the NYPD's Identity Task Force organized a sting cellphone delivery at the Grand Hyatt. Sources say the delivery man identified two people he took cell phones to on Tuesday, one of the men being Blake. Both men were handcuffed, but Blake was later released after being correctly identified by police. \\"This shouldn't have happened, and it's something that, you know, we'll deal with with the police and we'll find out what they have to say say internally,\\" Blake said. \\"You know, hopefully there was, there's video of it and we'll see what happens.\\" Police Commissioner Bill Bratton spoke to NY1 about the incident. \\"It's very disturbing, the idea that he claims he was rushed by a person in a pair of t-shirt and shorts who pushed him to the ground and he was assisted by four others who identified themselves, ultimately, as police officers, and that he suffered an injury during that.

This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge.

Problem:Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is believed to be the major initiator of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. As a result of intestinal I/R, the gut becomes a major source of inflammatory cytokine production.

We now examine the effects of HB-EGF on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in vivo.', 'Rats were randomized into three groups: sham-operated, superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO) for 90 min followed by 8 h of reperfusion (I/R), and I/R with intraluminal administration of HB-EGF 25 min after the initiation of ischemia (I/R + HB-EGF). Serum was drawn at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h post reperfusion for determination of cytokine protein levels using a bioplex suspension array system. Additional animals underwent the same ischemic protocol followed by 30 and 60 min of reperfusion with harvesting of ileal mucosa.

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the Valentine's Day of 1997, in a small town, a cave-in on the north side of a Hanninger mine trapped six miners. Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially reluctant to go, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before going inside. Sarah goes alone and gets lost looking for Axel and Irene. She runs across a teen and a few seconds later, he is stabbed through his eye. She is confronted by Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a bloody pickaxe, and she flees, finding several dead bodies. Axel grabs her and they, along with Irene, hide from the killer. Warden eventually sees the trio, and they run out of the mine, meeting Tom as he comes in. Warden hits Tom with the pickaxe, injuring him, while the other three run...

Fact 2: If warm air is advancing on cold air, the front is designated a warm front. Given the two facts above, what is most likely to result from warm air advancing on cold air? The answer is:","response":"When warm air advances on cold air, it is designated as a warm front. As a result, the interaction between the two air masses leads to the formation of specific weather conditions. In the case of a warm front, the most likely weather outcome would be cloudy and rainy conditions. To further understand this phenomenon, it is essential to examine the characteristics of both warm and cold air masses and the mechanism of a warm front formation. Warm air masses are lighter than cold air masses since warm air is less dense. When a warm air mass comes into contact with a colder, denser air mass, the warmer air tends to slide over the top of the colder air, causing the cold air to retreat. This interaction between the two air masses creates a boundary known as the warm front. As the warm air mass rises and slides over the retreating cold air mass, it begins to cool down, leading to condensation of the moisture content in the warm air. The condensation process results in the formation of stratus, altostratus and nimbostratus clouds, depending on the altitude at which the condensation occurs. These cloud formations are responsible for the cloudy and rainy weather conditions associated with a warm front. Apart from cloudiness and rainfall, a warm front may also result in an increase in temperature and humidity levels, as well as a gradual shift in wind direction. During the passage of a warm front, the temperature will rise due to the advancing warm air replacing the cold air. Additionally, the dew point, which is the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture, will increase since warm air can hold more moisture than cold air. In summary, when warm air advances on cold air, forming a warm front, the most likely outcome is cloudy and rainy weather conditions. This is due to the interaction between the two air masses, which leads to the formation of clouds and precipitation as a result of the condensation process. The passage of a warm front also brings about changes in temperature, humidity, and wind direction, further impacting the overall weather conditions experienced in the affected region."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The ideal weight is one that allows you to do one set of eight to 12 repetitions. Your muscle or muscle group should feel very fatigued at the end of the session.

Lifting heavy weights may lead to muscle fatigue, but it's not ideal for gradual muscle strength improvement when starting. (3). This option doesn't specifically address the appropriate weight topic and instead talks about becoming more active in general terms. While activity and doctor consultation are important aspects of exercise and weight loss, they don't relate directly to choosing the appropriate weight for building strength gradually. (4).

The motion seeking a stay of execution cites questions over the state's lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court did not immediately issue a ruling on the petition. The appeals court's earlier ruling overturned U.S. District Court Judge Nanette Laughrey, who held that the Missouri Department of Corrections \\"has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.\\" She noted that the execution protocol, which has changed repeatedly, \\"has been a frustratingly moving target.\\" The state's death warrant for Franklin allows the execution to be carried out anytime Wednesday. After Laughrey ruled in his favor, Franklin's attorney, Jennifer Herndon, said Franklin's mental illness was likely keeping him from comprehending the developments. Franklin, 63, was convicted of seven other murders, but the Missouri case was the only one resulting in a death sentence. Franklin also has admitted to shooting and wounding civil rights leader Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the attack in 1978. Like other states, Missouri long had used a three-drug execution method. Drugmakers stopped selling those drugs to prisons and corrections departments, so in April 2012 Missouri announced a new one-drug execution protocol using propofol. The state planned to use propofol for an execution last month. But Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the Missouri Department of Corrections to come up with a new drug after an outcry from the medical profession over planned use of the popular anesthetic in an execution. Most propofol is made in Europe, and the European Union had threatened to limit exports of it. The corrections department turned to pentobarbital made through a compounding pharmacy. Few details have been made public about the compounding pharmacy, because state law provides privacy for parties associated with executions. Missouri has joined other states in choosing pentobarbital as the drug of choice. Texas switched to a lethal, single dose of the sedative pentobarbital in 2012. South Dakota has carried out two executions using the sedative from a compounding pharmacy. Georgia has said it's also taking that route. Franklin was in his mid-20s when he began drifting across the country. He bombed a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., in July 1977. No one was hurt, but soon, the killings began. He arrived in the St. Louis area in October 1977 and picked out the Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue from the Yellow Pages. He fired five shots at the parking lot in Richmond Heights after a bar mitzvah on Oct. 8, 1977. One struck and killed Gerald Gordon, a 42-year-old father of three. Franklin got away. His killing spree continued another three years. Several of his victims were interracial couples. He also shot and killed, among others, two black children in Cincinnati, three female hitchhikers and a white 15-year-old prostitute, with whom he was angry because the girl had sex with black men. He finally stumbled after killing two young black men in Salt Lake City in August 1980. He was arrested a month later in Kentucky, briefly escaped, and was captured for good a month after that in Florida. Overall, Franklin was convicted of eight murders: two in Madison, Wis., two in Cincinnati, two in Salt Lake City, one in Chattanooga, Tenn., and the one in St. Louis County. Years later, in federal prison, Franklin admitted to several crimes, including the St. Louis County killing. He was sentenced to death in 1997. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Monday, Franklin insisted he no longer hates blacks or Jews. While he was held at St. Louis County Jail, he said he interacted with blacks at the jail, \\"and I saw they were people just like us.\\" He has made similar statements to other media but has denied repeated interview requests from The Associated Press. Herndon said Franklin's reasoning exemplified his mental illness: Franklin told her the digits of the AP's St. Louis office phone number added up to what he called an \\"unlucky number,\\" so he refused to call it. ||||| HANDOUT/REUTERS A combination photo shows Joseph Paul Franklin, who has been convicted of killing eight people from the late 1970s to 1980 in racially motivated attacks, in booking photos provided by the Missouri Department of Corrections taken in (L-R) 2005, 2007 and 2012. ST. LOUIS — A federal judge in Missouri on Tuesday granted a stay of execution to white supremacist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin just hours before his scheduled death, citing concerns over the state’s new execution method. U.S. District Court Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled that a lawsuit filed by Franklin and 20 other death row inmates challenging Missouri’s execution protocol must be resolved before he is put to death. The 14-page ruling criticizes the timing of the state’s changes to how it carries out capital punishment, specifically its plan to use for the first time a single drug, pentobarbital. It also takes issue with a plan to acquire the drug from a compounding pharmacy. Laughrey wrote that the Missouri Department of Corrections “has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.” She noted that the execution protocol, which has changed repeatedly, “has been a frustratingly moving target.” It wasn’t immediately clear whether the state would appeal the ruling. Messages left with the state attorney general’s office were not returned. If a federal appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Laughrey’s ruling, the execution could go forward. Franklin’s attorney, Jennifer Herndon, said the execution warrant allows it to be carried out anytime Wednesday. Herndon said Franklin, who has been diagnosed as mentally ill, didn’t seem to fully understand the stay. “He was happy,” she said. “I’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die.” Franklin, 63, was convicted of seven other murders, but the Missouri case was the only one resulting in a death sentence. Franklin also has admitted to shooting and wounding civil rights leader Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who has been paralyzed from the waist down since the attack in 1978.

Anonymous/AP Joseph Paul Franklin is shown following his conviction on two counts of first degree murder in Salt Lake City in June 1981. “Throughout this litigation, the details of the execution protocol have been illusive at best,” Laughrey wrote. “It is clear from the procedural history of this case that through no fault of his own, Franklin could not resolve his claims without a stay of his scheduled execution date.” She added: “Franklin has been afforded no time to research the risk of pain associated with the Department’s new protocol, the quality of the pentobarbital provided, and the record of the source of the pentobarbital.” Nixon spokesman Scott Holste had no immediate comment about the ruling. Franklin was in his mid-20s when he began drifting across the country. He bombed a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., in July 1977. No one was hurt, but soon, the killings began. He arrived in the St. Louis area in October 1977 and picked out the Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue from the Yellow Pages. He fired five shots at the parking lot in Richmond Heights after a bar mitzvah on Oct. 8, 1977. One struck and killed Gerald Gordon, a 42-year-old father of three. Franklin got away. His killing spree continued another three years. Several of his victims were interracial couples. He also shot and killed, among others, two black children in Cincinnati, three female hitchhikers and a white 15-year-old prostitute, with whom he was angry because the girl had sex with black men. He finally stumbled after killing two young black men in Salt Lake City in August 1980. He was arrested a month later in Kentucky, briefly escaped, and was captured for good a month after that in Florida. Overall, Franklin was convicted of eight murders — two in Madison, Wis., two in Cincinnati, two in Salt Lake City, one in Chattanooga, Tenn., and the one in St. Louis County. Years later in federal prison, Franklin admitted to several crimes, including the St. Louis County killing. He was sentenced to death in 1997. On a mobile device?

Options: - bathroom - house - cupboard - space shuttle - surface of earth The answer is \\"cupboard\\" because A:","response":"A: The answer is \\"cupboard\\" because the given options include: 1. Bathroom: Although a bathroom can sometimes be the source of unpleasant odors, the given context specifies that the stale smell is coming from the kitchen, making this an unlikely source. 2. House: This option is too broad and doesn't specify a specific location within the house where the smell might be coming from. 3. Cupboard: This option is the most logical one to check since cupboards in a kitchen often store food items, such as spices, canned goods, and packaged snacks, which can emit a stale smell if they are expired or improperly sealed. 4. Space shuttle: This is an irrelevant option, as it is unrelated to the context of a kitchen and an unlikely source of a smell in a residential setting. 5. Surface of Earth: This option is also irrelevant and too broad, as it doesn't specify a location within a kitchen where the smell might be coming from. Based on these considerations, the most reasonable choice for a source of the stale smell in the kitchen is the cupboard. In the cupboard, one should check for any expired or spoiled food items, and properly clean and dispose of them to eliminate the unpleasant odor."},{"question":"What is an area with no grass where I can get things to sell at a roadside stand? Options: - surface of earth - rest area - supermarket - state park - garden Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1. Surface of Earth: This option is too broad and does not give any specific area suitable for setting up a roadside stand. 2. Rest Area: A rest area, typically found along highways, can potentially be an excellent location for a roadside stand. It provides a space where travelers can take breaks and may be interested in purchasing goods or refreshments. However, you may need permission or a permit to sell items at a rest area. 3. Supermarket: A supermarket already sells various items and produce, so it might not be an ideal location to set up a roadside stand. Additionally, supermarkets often have their own dedicated parking lots, and you might not be allowed to set up a stand on their property. 4. State Park: A state park usually focuses on conserving nature and recreational activities, making it less suitable for setting up a roadside stand. It might also have regulations that prohibit commercial activities within its boundaries. 5. Garden: A garden is typically a private space, and while it might not have grass, it may not be a suitable location for a roadside stand. Additionally, it might not provide the foot (or vehicle) traffic needed for a successful stand. After considering these options, a rest area seems to be the most suitable location for setting up a roadside stand, as it caters to the needs of travelers and provides ample space. However, it is essential to check local regulations and requirements, as selling items at a rest area may need permissions or permits."},{"question":"Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day.

She is referred to as the Queen of Korean Pop. Born and raised in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, she was discovered by SM Entertainment talent agents when she accompanied her older brother to a talent search. BoA's second Japanese studio album, Valenti (2003), became her best-selling album, with over 1,249,000 copies sold. In support of the album, BoA launched BoA 1st Live Tour Valenti, her first Japanese concert tour. Later that year, she released two Korean albums, Atlantis Princess and the mini-album Shine We Are!. The former was the fifth-best-selling South Korean record of the year with around 345,000 units sold; the latter sold around 58,000 units. Her third Japanese studio album, Love & Honesty (2004) was a musical \\"change in direction\\": it contained a rock-dance song (\\"Rock with You\\") and \\"harder\\" R&B. Though the album failed to match Valenti in sales, it topped the Oricon chart for two weeks and became RIAJ-certified triple-platinum. In support of the album, BoA held a tour, Live Concert Tour 2004: Love & Honesty. In contrast with 1st Live Tour, which \\"emphasized exotic Asian design\\", the Love & Honesty tour had an \\"outer-space, sci-fi\\" theme; among the props were a three-story-high space ship and the robot Asimo. The tour, which started in Saitama and ended in Yokohama, spanned nine performances and attracted approximately 105,000 attendants. Her first compilation album, Best of Soul (2005), however, sold over a million copies, making BoA the first non-Japanese Asian singer to have two million-selling albums in Japan. BoA reinvented her image on her fourth Korean album, My Name (2004); she left the \\"cute\\" and \\"youthful\\" style that had characterized previous years and presented herself as \\"sexy\\" and \\"sultry\\". The album was the beginning of a foray into the Chinese market and contained two songs sung in Mandarin Chinese. The sales of BoA's Korean albums began to decline: the album sold 191,000 units and became the eleventh-best-selling South Korean album of the year. In September 2004, BoA instigated controversy in Japan when she donated W50 million to a memorial project for Korean independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun. Her fifth Korean album, Girls on Top (2005), continued her image change. The album portrayed the singer as more \\"mature and self-confident\\" and was a \\"declaration of war on male chauvinism\\"; the \\"bohemian\\" look of the cover photograph represented \\"freedom and depth\\", while music videos and album photographs that portrayed BoA in traditional Korean dress brought the \\"idea of Korean womanhood\\" into her music. The album also continued BoA's foray into the Chinese market and, like the previous album, contained Mandarin Chinese songs. The album sold less than the previous album; it was the fourteenth-best-selling record of the year in South Korea with 113,000 units sold.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else did you find interesting?","response":"BoA is a very talented South Korean singer, dancer, composer, and actress. She is like a queen in the world of Korean pop music. BoA was born on November 5, 1986, and she became famous after being discovered by some people who were looking for talented artists. She has made many albums and performed in many concerts too. Sometimes she changes her style and image, from cute and youthful to sexy and sultry.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \\"exi\\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year.

Formed in 1994, the group consisted of Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), and Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice). The Spice Girls played a significant role in the 1990s pop culture scene and became a global phenomenon, dominating the charts with their catchy tunes and promoting the message of \\"Girl Power.\\" The Spice Girls debuted in 1996 with their hit single \\"Wannabe,\\" which went on to become one of the most memorable and successful songs of the '90s, reaching number one in charts across several countries. Throughout their career, the Spice Girls released three studio albums: \\"Spice\\" (1996), \\"Spiceworld\\" (1997), and \\"Forever\\" (2000). These albums spawned multiple chart-topping singles, including \\"Say You'll Be There,\\" \\"2 Become 1,\\" \\"Spice Up Your Life,\\" and \\"Viva Forever.\\" Besides their musical success, the Spice Girls created a significant impact on popular culture, becoming symbols of female empowerment and influencing fashion trends. As each member embraced a distinctive personality and style, they attracted a wide range of fans, many of whom identified with one or more group members. The Spice Girls' popularity led to endorsement deals, merchandise, and even a feature film, \\"Spice World,\\" released in 1997. The film was a commercial success and added to the group's increasing fame. In 1998, Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) decided to leave the Spice Girls, marking the beginning of the band's gradual decline. The remaining four members continued to tour and produce new music, but their popularity waned. Following their initial disbandment in 2000, the Spice Girls pursued individual projects – from solo music careers to fashion lines and acting. However, they reunited several times for special performances, including the 2007–2008 \\"Return of the Spice Girls\\" world tour, a one-off appearance at the 2012 London Olympics' closing ceremony, and concerts in 2019.

Paul Klee (German: [paUl 'kle:]; 18 December 1879 - 29 June 1940) was a Swiss German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture. During his twelve-day educational trip to Tunis in April 1914 Klee produced with Macke and Moilliet watercolor paintings, which implement the strong light and color stimulus of the North African countryside in the fashion of Paul Cezanne and Robert Delaunays' cubistic form concepts. The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works In den Hausern von Saint-Germain (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and Strassencafe (Streetcafe). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as Abstract and Farbige Kreise durch Farbbander verbunden (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons). He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world. Fohn im Marc'schen Garten (Foehn at Marc's Garden) was made after the Turin trip. It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time: In the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [...] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art. Under the impression of his military service he created the painting Trauerblumen (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in Blumenmythos (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes. In the 1918 watercolor painting Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht, a compositional implemented poem, possible written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee's art dealer, saw in them a \\"Wachablosung\\" (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The Villa R (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","response":"As an AI language model, I don't engage in provocative opinions or assumptions, but I can provide some contextual information that may help answer the question. Snow White's dwarves and the Hobbit's dwarves come from different fictional universes. The Snow White dwarves are characters from the fairy tale \\"Snow White,\\" published by the Brothers Grimm, while the Hobbit's dwarves are part of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth universe, primarily featured in \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. Their characteristics and abilities differ significantly due to the different worlds and stories they belong to. Snow White's dwarves are depicted as kind-hearted, hard-working miners with varying personalities. They are Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. Though they showed some protective traits towards Snow White, they are not notably known for their prowess in battles or warfare. On the other hand, the dwarves from Tolkien's Middle-Earth are known for their skills in craftsmanship, mining, and combat. They are a race of mighty warriors who can hold their own in battles. In \\"The Hobbit,\\" the central group of dwarves is made up of Thorin Oakenshield, Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Oin, and Gloin, who embark on a quest to reclaim their kingdom from the dragon Smaug. They are depicted as strong, skilled fighters armed with weapons and armor. Based on these characteristics, it would be reasonable to deduce that the dwarves from \\"The Hobbit\\" would likely have a significant advantage in battle over the more gentle and less combat-focused dwarves from \\"Snow White.\\" However, as both groups of dwarves are from entirely different fictional universes, any definitive outcome remains speculative and open to personal interpretation."},{"question":"Answer the following question: who is the 28th president of the united states?","response":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: 1.

Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak.

He is supposed to go on a trip to Amsterdam with his dad (Linden Ashby), but his dad is busy with work, so Van ends up going alone. Van ends up going to Coolidge, following family tradition. His family has their name on a building there, Wilder Hall. However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the fun loving school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon (Kurt Fuller). Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall). His roommate is Farley (Nestor Aaron Absera), a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok (Jerry Shea). The boys try to find the girls, but they just find some religious, prudish girls led by Eve (Meredith Giangrande). After she throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank on them during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk (Steve Talley) and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict (Nick Nicotera), on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin (Kristin Cavallari), causing Dirk to get even more upset. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage. Of course, Van has to shake things up.

Bo, Luke , and Daisy Duke Answer:","response":"Title: Runnin' on Duke Time Genre: Action-Comedy Synopsis: In the small rural town of Hazzard County, three cousins Bo, Luke, and Daisy Duke along with their wise, old Uncle Jesse reside. Bo and Luke, two well-known good ole' boys, spend their days driving around in their custom 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed 'The General Lee.' Their stunning cousin Daisy, a tough country girl, works as a bartender at the local tavern, The Boar's Nest. Together they struggle to make ends meet while consistently outwitting the devious and scheming business tycoon, Boss Hogg, and his bumbling sidekick, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. Plot: The story begins when Boss Hogg devises a devious plan to take possession of the Duke family's farm - a property with a treasure trove of natural resources. He manipulates the local authorities to seize the Duke's farm through a false eminent domain claim. Bo, Luke, and Daisy Duke can only retain their land if they manage to pay the imposed exorbitant tax by the end of the month. Desperate to save their family's heritage, the three cousins embark on a mission to compete in The Hazzard County Grand Tournament - a 3-week series of races, rodeos, and good old-fashioned challenges with a grand prize of 100,000 - just enough to save their farm. They bring their driving and sharpshooting skills to each event alongside their charming personalities, making them the crowd favorites. As the Duke cousins advance through the competition, Boss Hogg becomes increasingly concerned with their success. He conspires with a famous race car driver named Johnny \\"The Rocket\\" Rexford to join the tournament and beat the Dukes at their own game. Johnny brings his expertise in racing and shameless trickery to the tournament, making it more challenging for the Duke cousins. During the tournament, Bo, Luke, and Daisy uncover the secret hidden behind Boss Hogg's plan: beneath their family farm lies a vast oil reserve, which he wants to exploit. Now, this competition is not just about saving their farm but also preserving Hazzard County's natural beauty and resources from the greedy hands of Boss Hogg. As the final race of the tournament approaches, tension and excitement fill the air. Bo, Luke, and Daisy Duke must face their new rival Johnny and their cunning enemies, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco, in a high-speed, action-packed, off-road car chase. After a thrilling race filled with adrenaline-pumping stunts and hilarious mishaps, the Duke cousins emerge victorious. They win the tournament and the grand prize, paying off the tax debt to save their farm. In a last heroic move, they reveal Boss Hogg's dirty scheme to the townsfolk, who then unite to protect their land and resources. The film ends with a massive celebration at The Boar's Nest, where the Duke family, their friends, and the whole of Hazzard County rejoice in their victory. As fields of sunflowers sway in the breeze, the beloved General Lee speeds down the dirt road, leaving puffs of dust in its wake - a testament to the unwavering spirit and unbreakable bond of the Duke family, who have become legends in their town."},{"question":"Premise: \\"The second key element in our definition is a comprehensive understanding.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Comprehensive understanding is a key element of the definition.\\" true?","response":"To verify the validity of the given hypothesis based on the premise, the steps to carry out could be as follows: Step 1: Thoroughly examine the premise.

For aficionados, it is nothing short of liquid gold. To really appreciate whiskey, there can be few better ways than doing so at the source, as it were. Just like wine tastes better at the vineyard and trout best fresh out of the stream, the drink that some call “Kentucky tea” rarely tastes better than at the distillery where it is made. Whether one wants to see where a favorite bourbon gets born or brave a journey to a remote Scottish island, more and more distilleries are seeing the advantages in welcoming whiskey-loving tourists. With visitors buying whiskey-related merchandise, eating in local restaurants and staying at local inns, the distilleries are not limited to selling whiskey to generate profits. Fortunately, thanks to a happy confluence of geography, climate and culture, most whiskey distilleries in Scotland–where it’s spelled “whisky,” which is derived from the Gaelic word uisgebeatha, meaning “water of life”–are located fairly close to one another. A visitor to the island of Islay, in Scotland’s Hebrides, can tour the distilleries of Lagavulin , Laphroaig and Bowmore all in the same day. Equally convenient is the Whisky Trail, the informal name given to a group of distilleries in the Speyside region of the Scottish Highlands. The area is home to some of the world’s finest distilleries, such as Glenlivet , Cardhu and Glenfiddich . Since all of these offer visitors healthy samples of their products, it is recommended that at least one member of the party be the designated driver–or hire a car. The roads in the Highlands are famous for their inability to go in a straight line. Whiskey drinkers who want to stay closer to home can visit distilleries in Tennessee or Kentucky, and even in Canada. Forbes.com has selected some of the best whiskey tours in the world, from schools and cruises to traditional distillery visits. Happy trails, and bottoms up. Maker’s Mark President Bill Samuels Bill Samuels Jr. is the Richard Branson Richard Branson of the bourbon world. This seventh-generation distiller started out as a rocket scientist, studying engineering and physics at UC Berkeley, before one of his experimental rockets crashed through the roof of a building. These days, he’s applying his showmanship to marketing his liquor. After the Arthur Andersen / Enron fiasco, Samuels commissioned a billboard in Times Square featuring an empty bottle of Maker’s Mark with the caption, “Disappears faster than a Big Five accounting firm.” The billboard quickly came down. The Maker’s Mark distillery is located in Loretto, Ky., which is one stop on the so-called Bourbon Trail. The Jim Beam and Wild Turkey distilleries are also close by, but Maker’s Mark is the only one that gives full tours. Real whiskey aficionados will want to make a pit stop at the Oscar Getz Museum of Whiskey History in nearby Bardstown. Maker’s Mark looks more like a tiny village than a place of business. The red visitors’ center was built in 1889 and was originally the resident distiller’s home. A sign on the gatehouse has the same warning it did 100 years ago: “Passage is free to anyone going to church.” This credo is perfect for those who worship at the altar of whiskey.

So if you’re thirsting for some Black Jack after the tour, you’d better head to the next county. First licensed in 1866, the Jack Daniels distillery is the country’s oldest registered distillery and remains a National Historic site. The tour is peppered with history and tales of the early days of distilling. The distillery also has more than 30 exhibits pertaining to Tennessee sour mash and the life of five-foot-two-inch founder Jasper Newton “Jack” Daniels Jasper Newton “Jack” Daniels .

The Glenora Inn & Distillery bills itself as the only single-malt distillery in North America. It’s located in Glenville, in Inverness County, Nova Scotia, and has been producing whiskey for 12 years. Glenora also produces three types of rum, called Smugglers Cove. The Glen Breton whiskey is made from already-malted barley imported from Scotland and is aged in oak barrels formerly used at the Jack Daniels distillery in Tennessee. Tours are only C5, and prices at the inn range from C92 to C120 for rooms and C147 to C210 for chalets. What’s next, Californian whiskey? Glenora Inn & Distillery P.O.

Each summer, up to 200 boats can register to be a part of the Classic Malts Cruise , which is a loosely organized 200-mile tour through the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, with daily stops to distilleries. Captains can choose their own route from Oban to Skye, and back south to Islay. Along the way, ships will make port calls near the distilleries of Oban, Talisker and Lagavulin, and can spend the night. Crews also meet up for barbecues, tastings and distillery tours on set dates to ensure some mingling. There is no fee to participate, but attendance is limited to the first 200 people who sign up their boats.

The school offers a three-day course, where students follow the process of Scotch whisky production, lend a hand and, of course, sample the goods. The owners of the distillery are there to demonstrate the steps involved in creating the “water of life”: milling, brewing, fermenting and distilling. Class size is restricted to 12 people, and the school costs £295 (approximately 450) per person, or £520 (approximately 790) for two. Accommodations are not included.

More than half of Scotland’s malt whisky distilleries are in Speyside. All of the distilleries have tours (as well as places to eat and usually an on-site bed-and-breakfast), so many people take several days to stumble around the Highlands, sampling the different varieties of the liquor. In between having a few drams, visitors can also treat themselves to rounds of golfs, castle tours and hiking through the rolling hills, all scented by the biscuity smell of fermentation. Many of the distilleries have developed their own non-whisky-based attractions. The gardens at Glen Grant, originally created in the 1870s, have just been completely restored. Guests who hike to the top of Major’s Dram Hut will cross through orchards and over rustic bridges, and can view a waterfall that cascades near the distillery. Technically, the Whisky Trail only refers to seven distilleries, which have formed a coalition of sorts: Cardhu, Dallas Dhu, Glenfarclas, Glenfiddich, Glen Grant, Glenlivet and Strathisla. During the four-day Spirit of Speyside whisky festival each May, visitors can enjoy whisky in a variety of ways, such as while hang gliding.

At the Glenmorangie distillery, located in the Highlands, visitors can learn about the entire distillation process, as well as the selection of the barrels, which come from oak trees in the Ozarks. The barrels are then loaned to the Heaven Hill Bourbon distillery until reclaimed by Glenmorangie. The on-site inn, Glenmorangie House, is also worth a stop. From the outside, it looks like a typical Highlands mansion, but inside the atmosphere is warm and relaxed. Royal Dornach golf course is also nearby. Glenmorangie Cadboll, Fearn Ross-Shir, Tain Scotland Phone: 01862 871671 While the Whisky Trail is the best-known distillery tour in Scotland, the distilleries along the islands of Islay and Jura are also worth a stop. These islands, on the west coast of Scotland, are home to such distilleries as Ardbeg, Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ile, Jura, Laphroaig, Lagavulin and Kilchoman. What makes these Scotch whiskies different from their Highland counterparts is the abundance of peat bogs, which affect the water and result in a very peaty, strong taste. Some say the seaweed affects the air in which it ages, and hints of this can also be detected. Islay and Jura are dotted with bed-and-breakfasts and small inns. Every summer, Islay hosts a weeklong whisky festival, which includes ceilidhs (traditional Scottish storytelling evenings), Celtic music concerts, distillery tours, golf competition, cooking-with-whisky evenings and a sponsored charity “barrel push” across Islay. The festivities culminate in a carnival on Port Ellen Green. Islay Whisky Festival E-mail: islayfestival@lineone.net For a taste of Irish whiskey, head to the Jameson distillery in the heart of Dublin, just north of the River Liffey. The distillery began giving tours in 1997, and the first tour each day starts at 9:30 AM. Visitors will learn about the differences between Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky. (Irish whiskey is produced from a mixture of malted and unmalted Irish barley. The barley is then dried in a closed kiln to preserve its malty flavors. In Scotland, the malted barley is dried using peat, and the peat smoke is what gives Scotch whisky its smoky taste.) After the tour, guests can stop for lunch at the Stillroom Restaurant, which serves roasted game, casseroles and fish.

He died aged 42 after mistakes by Wythenshawe Hospital consultants, an inquest heard. A father-of-two died of a heart infection after doctors missed three chances to save him, an inquest has heard. Stephen Avery, 42, could have lived if doctors had put him on antibiotics just 48 hours sooner, it was said. But, despite displaying the telltale symptoms of infection, consultants at Wythenshawe Hospital missed three opportunities to treat the taxi-driver and former local football team manager and coach. At his inquest in Manchester, heart expert Professor Keith Channer condemned the decisions made by hospital staff. Describing. Dr Channer’s evidence as ‘compelling’, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'An. appropriate physician should have been able to recognise the symptoms as. indicated. Had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would. not have died.' Mr Avery, from Crossacres, Wythenshawe, first visited his GP in October 2011, suffering broken sleep, night sweats and lethargy. He was diagnosed with a chest infection, and prescribed antibiotics. But his symptoms worsened after a brief improvement, prompting further antibiotics and a referral. Then at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 1, 2012, Dr Paul Sanders, consultant rheumatologist, recognised his symptoms as indicating a heart infection, but after tests, failed to diagnose him. On his return on May 11, Dr Keith Harkins, consultant physician, again suspected Mr Avery had a heart infection, but stopped his GP-prescribed antibiotics to carry out tests, including a heart scan. Due to a system failure, the scan order never reached the right department. Mr Avery with mother Maureen, wife Jennifer, 44, daughter Phoebe, now 14, son Dominic, now 18. If the popular father had had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would not have died, it was said. On May 14, yet another consultant. re-ordered the scan urgently, but when his condition was finally. diagnosed the next day, and an antibiotics drip was started, it was too. late. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died on May 15. Coroner. Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made. him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis. Coroner Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis. He said contributory factors were ‘significant failures’ on May 1 and. May 11 to recognise his symptoms and failure to start the right. antibiotics drip by the 12th. He said if the young father had the right scan, diagnosis and treatment earlier, he probably would have survived. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Meadows added: 'These medical practitioners are bound to reflect upon their involvement but at the time they thought they were making the right judgements. 'But they were not judgements that were well-founded.' Popular and well-liked Mr Avery lived in Stockport and worked for Wythenshawe’s Club Cars. More than 800 people attended his funeral and he left behind wife Jennifer and children Dominic, 18, and Phoebe, 14. After the hearing his wife, 44, said: 'Wythenshawe Hospital has not only let our family down but they have let our entire community down. 'Stephen was a wonderful family man but also so well-known and loved in the community. 'The findings of the inquest have confirmed the family’s view that Stephen’s death could and should have been avoided if only he had been provided with appropriate and prompt clinical care and management during his time in hospital.' A University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Avery following their very sad loss. 'The trust has reflected on its practice following its investigation to understand what lessons can be learned. 'We will also give full and careful consideration to the comments and feedback from the coroner.' Infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics. After someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. It is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers. The infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life-threatening. Most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body. People who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles. In the UK, endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year. It is most common in people with heart valve problems, have had heart valve surgery, have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system. Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, having aches and pains, tiredness, fever and loss of appetite.

He went to the hospital because he was feeling really sick and had a lot of symptoms like not being able to sleep well, sweating at night, and feeling very tired. The doctors at the hospital didn't figure out what was wrong with him, and they didn't give him the medicine he needed in time to save his life. If they had given him the medicine sooner, he might have lived. The doctors missed a few chances to help him, and because of that, he got much sicker and eventually passed away. The problem he had was an infection in his heart. This made his family and the people who loved him very sad.

Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 06:59 EST, 17 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:11 EST, 17 June 2013. An IT specialist is suing for £150,000 claiming an accident at work has left him with unique disabilities preventing him from texting or using other gadgets. Isaak Alpman says he has been left with a 'misshapen right index finger', amongst other disabilities, which have seen him go from working at the forefront of the computer world to being unable to use a normal mouse and keyboard. The 59-year-old says his injuries are so bad he cannot get work and even has to get his son to send text messages on his behalf. Proceedings: A computer expert is suing at the High Court for £150,000 after a fall at work injured his finger, preventing him from texting and using gadgets. Mr Alpman, of Rochester, Kent, claims he suffered his affliction when he fell down a flight of stairs while working in the computer server room at the West London headquarters of vintage and collectibles dealer, the Music and Goods Exchange Ltd, in April 2011. He has now issued a High Court writ claiming damages from the company of up to £150,000, on the basis that the staircase where the alleged accident took place was 'unsafe' and breached Health and Safety at Work regulations. In the writ, Mr Alpman's barrister, Gavin Argent, says that the accident happened on April 7 2011 as the IT specialist was climbing the 'steep' first floor stairs to the server room at his employer's HQ. 'He tripped on the staircase, twisted to the right, hit the wall on the right side and fell backwards down the staircase, hitting his head and sustaining personal injuries,' the barrister said. 'The staircase was narrow, old and worn, making it unsafe, and furthermore the hand rail to the left of the staircase was dangerous and unusable because running the length of the stair rail was a live electric cable. 'Mr Alpman was unable to grab hold of the handrail in order to prevent his fall down the stairs,' the barrister adds. Claim: Isaak Alpman's fall down some stairs means he struggles to use a mouse or keyboard (posed by model) Mr Alpman suffered injuries to his right shoulder, knee, hands and spine and is now said to be 'at a disadvantage on the open labour market and disabled. 'He was dismissed by the defendant within a month of the accident and has been unable to work or find work since...he is unable to get another job in IT because, when he discloses his injuries, he is rejected,' the barrister claims. He goes on to describe Mr Alpman's injuries which have led to his trouble with technology, the foremost of which is his problem with his index finger. 'He has developed carpal tunnel syndrome since the incident. His right index finger has become misshapen. He is unable to use a computer mouse and standard keyboard. Text messages are sent by his son on his behalf,' Mr Argent states. 'He is unable to lift or raise his arm on the right side above waist level. He cannot carry anything in his right hand and is now unable to write with that hand. He is right handed.' The company's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the allegations in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge. Highlights:","response":"1.

Answer: Producing crops that can be preserved or stored for longer durations is a convenient way for small farmers to maintain their crop yields without worrying about spoilage or waste. By focusing on crops that can be preserved, they can ensure a consistent supply of their produce throughout the year, even during off-seasons. This also enables them to potentially sell their products at a higher price when there is a lower supply in the market.

While the information given in the scenario establishes that the girl was murdered, there isn't enough information to determine the precise time of her death in relation to Shane's work schedule. In order to conclude whether the girl was murdered before Shane left for work, we would need more details about the timeline of events and any factors that might have affected them. For example, we would need to know when Shane left for work, when he returned, and if there was any possibility of the girl's body being moved or tampered with during that time. In addition, the scenario doesn't provide any information about where the girl's body was found, whether it was hidden or visible to passersby, or if there were any signs of struggle or witnesses who could provide further context for the timing of the murder. Moreover, understanding the cause of death and any other forensic evidence could possibly help establish a more accurate timeline for the murder. Factors such as weather, temperature, and potential interference from animals or other people could also affect the condition of the girl's body and therefore impact the ability to determine when exactly she was murdered. In summary, without further information on the time and circumstances of the girl's murder, as well as any background information on both the victim and potential suspects, it's impossible to definitively say whether the girl was murdered before Shane left for work."},{"question":"First question: What are the top engineering colleges of Madhya Pradesh?

Article: A student and his teacher were walking through the forest. The student was disturbed by the fact that his mind was in constant unrest . He asked his teacher, \\"Why most people's minds are restless, and only a few have a calm mind? What can one do to still the mind ?\\" The teacher looked at him, smiled and said, \\"I will tell you a story. An elephant was standing and picking leaves from a tree. A small fly came, flying and buzzing near his ear. The elephant waved it away with his long ears. Then the fly came again, and the elephant waved it away _ \\". This was repeated several times. Then the elephant asked the fly, \\"Why are you so restless and noisy? Why can't you stay for a while in one place?\\" The fly answered, \\"I am attracted to whatever I see, hear or smell. My five senses pull me constantly in all directions and I cannot resist them. What is your secret? How can you stay so calm and still?\\" The elephant stopped eating and said, \\"My five senses do not rule my attention. Whatever I do, I get immersed in it. Now that I am eating, I am completely immersed in eating. In this way I can enjoy my food and chew it better. I rule and control my attention, and not the other way around.\\" The student's eyes opened wide and smile rose on his face. \\"I understand! If my five senses are in control of my mind and attention, then my mind is in constant unrest. If I am in charge of my five senses and attention, then my mind becomes calm\\". \\"Yes, that's right\\", answered the teacher, \\"The mind is restless and goes wherever the attention is. Control your attention, and you control your mind\\". Question: The main purpose of the passage is to tell the readers _ Options: A: the relationship between the mind and attention B: how to make use of the five senses C: people should stay calm and still D: only the elephant can control the mind and attention A:","response":"The main purpose of the passage is to tell the readers about \\"the relationship between the mind and attention\\" (Option A). This story between the teacher and the student delves into the primary concept of where the attention lies, the mind follows. It becomes a metaphorical exploration of how control over one's attention can lead to control over the mind. In the story, the teacher explains this concept through the tale of the elephant and the fly. The elephant represents peace and tranquility that comes from complete immersion and control over one's senses. In contrast, the fly symbolizes restlessness and constant shifting of attention led by external stimuli. The teacher explains to the student that if he can channel his focus and direct his five senses rather than being led by them, he can achieve a state of calm and tranquility in his mind. Essentially, being in command of one's attention allows for the mind to remain steady and peaceful, reflecting a profound connection between attention and the mind. While the passage also does touch slightly on making use of the five senses (Option B), keeping calm and still (Option C), and even an anecdotal example of an elephant having control over its attention (Option D), the overarching intention of the passage is to enlighten readers about the core interaction between the mind and attention, and how the control over one can govern the other. Consequently, the most accurate answer to the main purpose of the passage is Option A."},{"question":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","response":"What is the process by which plants, algae, and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis? Factual answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some microorganisms convert light energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of glucose or other sugar molecules. This process is vital for life on Earth, as it plays a central role in the energy and carbon cycles of the biosphere. The process can be broken down into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, pigments such as chlorophyll, and other antenna molecules, absorb light energy in the form of photons. This energy excites electrons in the pigment molecules, which are then transferred through a series of proteins called the electron transport chain. As the electrons move along the chain, they release energy that is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient. The process of ATP synthase, a protein complex in the thylakoid membrane, uses this proton gradient to generate ATP – the energy currency of the cell – by adding a phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). Concurrently, water molecules are split by a protein complex called photosystem II, releasing oxygen gas, protons, and electrons. The electrons from the split water molecules replace the excited electrons in chlorophyll that were transferred to the electron transport chain, while the oxygen gas exits as a waste product. This process of converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH (an electron carrier) is called photophosphorylation. The light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. The main goal of the Calvin cycle is to produce glucose or other sugar molecules using energy from the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere enters the cycle by combining with a 5-carbon molecule called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO. This generates an unstable 6-carbon intermediate, which immediately splits into two 3-carbon molecules, 3-phosphoglycerate. Subsequent enzymatic reactions convert the 3-phosphoglycerate molecules into other 3-carbon sugars, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which can be further processed into glucose or other organic molecules. Some of these sugar molecules are used to regenerate the RuBP molecules necessary for the continuation of the cycle. The entire Calvin cycle requires the input of six molecules of CO2 to produce a single glucose molecule. Overall, photosynthesis enables plants, algae, and some microorganisms to convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose and other organic molecules, which provide the energetic and carbon-based foundation for virtually all life on Earth."},{"question":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

Hypothesis: Tribes make a ton of money off of casinos. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options: [A]. yes [B]. it is not possible to tell [C]. no","response":"[A]. Yes The premise entails the hypothesis for several reasons. First and foremost, the premise suggests that the Native American tribes are unhappy with their previous means of income and are seeking more lucrative opportunities. This dissatisfaction is evident through the description of the fireworks and untaxed cigarette sales as \\"chump change.\\" The term \\"chump change\\" implies that the previous methods for generating income were insufficient, with little financial reward. Subsequently, the premise proceeds to mention that the tribes have opened casinos on their reservations all over the state. This development suggests that the various Native American tribes have identified gambling casinos as a way to generate substantial income. The opening of multiple casinos implies that the tribes have recognized the potential financial benefits of the gambling industry, leading them to invest in the development and management of these establishments. The hypothesis, \\"Tribes make a ton of money off of casinos,\\" aligns with the information provided in the premise. Since the tribes are dissatisfied with their previous sources of income and have opened gambling casinos in many locations, it is reasonable to infer that they have found a more lucrative opportunity in the gambling industry. Additionally, there is considerable evidence to support the idea that casinos are generally profitable, both within and outside of Native American reservations. In the real world, casinos are known for generating significant revenue, especially when operated successfully and strategically managed. Therefore, the premise's information, combined with real-world knowledge about the profitability of casinos, supports the hypothesis that tribes make \\"a ton of money\\" off of casinos. Furthermore, it is essential to note that Native American reservations often have unique advantages in the casino industry due to certain legal frameworks. For instance, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) was passed in the United States in 1988, allowing tribes to establish gambling facilities on their reservations under specific conditions. This law has played a crucial role in enabling tribes to generate substantial income through casinos and benefit from this financial source. In conclusion, the premise entails the hypothesis that tribes make a ton of money off of casinos. The dissatisfaction with the previous income sources mentioned in the premise, combined with the investment in multiple gambling casinos across the state, suggests an expectation of higher profits. Furthermore, real-world evidence about the profitability of casinos and legal frameworks favoring tribal gambling operations solidifies the hypothesis's credibility."},{"question":"Season two of \\"South Park\\", an American animated television series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, began airing on April 1, 1998.

Mark wants to go mountain climbing while Jordan wants to go to a concert out of state. Jordan sometimes has a hard time breathing as well so they take this into consideration while making the plans for their trip. Will there be more oxygen in the air at the top of the mountain or at the concert? Hint: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.

Title: Apollo 18 Movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would site A see less or more litter and debris depostied than site B?

It is an astonishing but sobering fact that people are twice as likely to flock to their Ikea store than to church on Sundays. The only service they partake in takes place in front of a cash till, not an altar. It has been claimed that more people read the Ikea catalogue than the Bible. Indeed if you stay in a hotel in certain parts of Ikea’s homeland in southern Sweden you will find the latest Ikea catalogue next to the customary New Testament. One in 10 Europeans now living was supposedly conceived on an Ikea bed. The resulting babies are likely to sleep in an Ikea cot while their parents sit on Ikea sofas and eat off Ikea crockery which they store in Ikea cupboards. A third of all kitchens sold in France and Sweden are from Ikea. In Norway it’s half. Here in Britain we lag behind a bit but not much. Last year with much of the world stuck in recession the Swedish furniture and homewares retailer delivered record annual net profits of £3.2billion. Sales in the 44 countries with Ikea stores grew by almost 10 per cent to a staggering £27.6billion. All of which should add a satisfying element to the 87th birthday tomorrow of Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad. But Mr Kamprad, a widower, does not go in for extravagances such as birthday parties. For despite featuring regularly in lists of the world’s richest billionaires, the man who persuaded the British to “chuck out the chintz” is notoriously careful with money. He could easily afford a private jet but would rather fly economy class and preferably on a budget airline. Arriving at a gala to receive a Businessman Of The Year Award he was at first refused entry because he had come on the bus. At home he drove an ancient Volvo for years until he was persuaded that it was too dangerous. Rather than dining in Michelin starred restaurants he likes to drop in to one of his stores for a cheap meal of his favourite Swedish meatballs. In cafeterias he swipes the little packets of salt and pepper to take home. Admittedly he has lived in Switzerland as a tax exile since 1976. But his home is a modest bungalow and he assembled every stick of Ikea flatpack furniture in it himself. He regards luxury not merely as an indulgence but almost as a sin. In his memoir Testament Of A Furniture Dealer he wrote: “We don’t need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!” Employees – although he prefers to call them “co-workers” – at Ikea HQ are told to use both sides of a sheet of paper and get a telling-off if they leave the lights on when leaving a room. Certainly anyone encountering him doing his shopping in the local market (always near closing time when vendors are more likely to drop their prices) dressed in his scruffy coat would assume he was just another elderly gent living on a tight budget rather than the fifth wealthiest entrepreneur in the world. And that is just how Ingvar Kamprad likes it. Ever since he started his business in 1943 when he was just 17, he has controlled his own and his company’s public image with consummate skill. ||||| At least once in your life–maybe even once a week or once a day for that matter–you have fantasized about coming into a lot of money. What would you do if you were worth millions or even billions? Believe it or not there are millionaires and billionaires among us who masquerade as relatively normal, run-of-the-mill people. Take a peek at some of the most frugal wealthy people in the world. Warren Buffett Millions of people read Buffett’s books and follow his firm Berkshire Hathaway’s every move. But the real secret to Buffett’s personal fortune may be his penchant for frugality. Buffett, who is worth an estimated 47 billion, eschews opulent homes and luxury items. He still lives in a modest home in Omaha, Neb., which he purchased for just 31,500 more than 50 years ago. Although he’s dined in the best restaurants around the globe, given the choice he would opt for a good burger and fries accompanied by a cold cherry Coke. When asked why he doesn’t own a yacht, he responded “Most toys are just a pain in the neck.” Carlos Slim While most of the world is very familiar with Bill Gates, the name Carlos Slim rarely rings a bell. But it’s a name worth knowing. Slim, who is a native of Mexico, was just named the world’s richest billionaire–that’s right, richer than the überfamous Microsoft founder. Slim is worth more than 53 billion, and while he could afford the world’s most extravagant luxuries, he rarely indulges. He, like Buffett, doesn’t own a yacht or plane, and he has lived in the same home for over 40 years. Ingvar Kamprad The founder of the Swedish furniture phenomenon Ikea struck success with affordable, assemble-it-yourself furniture. For Kamprad, figuring out how to save money isn’t just for his customers, it’s a high personal value. He’s been quoted as saying “Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.” That goes for the founder as well. He flies coach for business, and when he needs to get around town locally he either takes the bus or will head out in his 15-year-old Volvo 240 GL. Chuck Feeney Growing up in the wake of The Depression as an Irish-American probably has something to do with Feeney’s frugality. With a personal motto of “I set out to work hard, not get rich,” the co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers has quietly become a billionaire but even more secretively given almost all of it away through his foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies. In addition to giving more than 600 million to his alma mater Cornell University, he has given billions to schools, research departments and hospitals. Loath to spend if he doesn’t have to, Feeney beats both Buffett and Kamprad in the donation category, giving out less grants than only Ford and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations. A frequent user of public transportation, Feeney flies economy class, buys clothes from retail stores, and does not wast money on an extensive shoes closet, stating “you can only wear one pair of shoes at a time”. He raised his children in the same way; making them work the same normal summer jobs as most teens. Frederik Meijer If you live in the Midwest chances are good that you shop at Meijer’s chain of grocery stores. Meijer is worth more than 5 billion and nearly half of that was amassed when everyone else was watching their net worth drop in 2009. Like Buffett he buys reasonably-priced cars and drives them until they die, and like Kamprad he chooses affordable motels when on travel for work. Also, like Chuck Feeney, rather than carelessly spending his wealth Mr. Meijer is focused on the good that it can provide to the community. The Bottom Line The dirty little secret of some of the world’s wealthiest people is that they rarely act like it. Instead of over-the-top spending, they’re busy figuring out how to save and invest to have that much more in the future. It’s a habit you might want to consider in order to build up your own little storehouse of cash. ||||| Profile Billionaires: March 2012 Billionaires: March 2011 Billionaires: March 2010 Billionaires: March 2009 Billionaires: March 2008 Billionaires: March 2007 Billionaires: March 2006 Billionaires: March 2005 Billionaires: March 2004 Billionaires: March 2003 After his lawyers produced documents last year proving that Kamprad had irrevocably transferred the majority of his economic stake in global furniture retailer Ikea to his philanthropic foundations, later selling them the balance, his net worth took a drastic slide. But with the exception of his winery in Provence, Kamprad has historically shown little interest in the trappings of wealth anyway. He reportedly drives a Volvo 240 GL he has owned for two decades. At age 85 his great love remains Ikea and the culture he built that made Ikea one of the world's most successful brands and retailers. Known for his relentless pursuit of efficiency, Kamprad introduced the flat-pack in 1953, moved production to Soviet Poland in 1961 to minimize labor costs and publishes the Furniture Dealer's Testament or the \\"Ikea Bible,\\" which includes maxims such as \\"wasting resources is a mortal sin at Ikea.\\" Through his Ikano Group, Kamprad currently has interests in banking, real estate, asset management and insurance; Ikea is one of the firm's biggest customers.

Kamprad, who turns 90 on 30 March, has a reputation for penny-pinching, which he claims helped Ikea to become one of the world’s top brand names. We've hit peak home furnishings, says Ikea boss Read more “I don’t think I’m wearing anything that wasn’t bought at a flea market. It means that I want to set a good example,” he told Swedish channel TV4, according to business daily Dagens Industri which viewed the documentary. “It’s in the nature of Smaland to be thrifty,” he said, referring to Sweden’s southern agricultural region where he comes from. Kamprad is estimated to have an accumulated fortune of about 610bn kroner (about ‎€65.5bn), according to recent Swedish media reports. But it is difficult to separate what belongs to him, what belongs to his children and what is held in a family foundation in one of Europe’s most infamous tax havens, Liechtenstein. In 2006, the American business magazine Forbes listed him as the fourth richest person in the world. Kamprad’s modest spending habits have made headlines over the years. In 2008, he told newspaper Sydsvenskan that a €22 bill in the Netherlands had broken his hair cut budget. “Normally, I try to get my haircut when I’m in a developing country. Last time it was in Vietnam,” Kamprad explained. In 1973, he fled Sweden’s higher tax structure for Denmark, before seeking even lower taxes in Switzerland. From 2010 onward, Kamprad progressively retired from the family company to make way for his three sons, finally returning to live in Sweden in 2014. ||||| Summary:","response":"Despite their immense wealth, some billionaires are known for their frugal lifestyles and modest spending habits.

Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works. Ginny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and life on the boardwalk, and has been carrying on an affair with Mickey for a few months. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the carousel and goes fishing with his friends to bring home dinner. He finds joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to attend night school.

To put it simply, this app is highly lacking in so many aspects. Firstly, the user interface doesn't offer the smooth experience that I'm typically accustomed to with Google's other services. It is outdated, clunky and doesn't provide intuitive navigation, making it difficult for me to do simple tasks. Secondly, the app always seems to be eating up my battery life. Even when it's running in the background, my device frequently gets hot and my battery drains at an astonishing rate. While I appreciate the features, it's not worth killing my device's battery life so quickly. Furthermore, the app has an annoying habit of crashing without any warning. I always lose my progress in the tasks I am doing which is incredibly frustrating. This problem happens regardless of whether I have other apps running, showing a glaring lack of optimization from Google's end. In terms of functionality, the app fails to deliver on its promises. There have been numerous times when the app didn't sync my data properly, leading to data loss and unnecessary duplication of work for me. Customer support has also been less than helpful. Instead of providing useful solutions, they simply suggest basic troubleshooting steps that I had already tried before reaching out for help. In summary, while I had high hopes for an app under Google's umbrella, the one with package com.google.android.gms is an absolute disappointment. It desperately needs updates and improvements to bring it up to par with the standard quality that is generally expected of Google products. I hope they address these issues soon so that others don't have to go through the same experience I did."},{"question":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What song on the album No Protection was a No. 1 in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in April 1987?

Exorcisms are being performed on Asians across the UK as a method of treatment for mental illnesses such as bi-polar disease, epilepsy and schizophrenia, an investigation has found. Hundreds of British Asians are operating as healers, blaming the supernatural for mental health problems and charging sometimes thousands of pounds a session to remove evil spirits from bodies believed to be possessed. An exorcist operating in east London has said the demons can ‘deceive doctors’ and research by BBC’s Newsnight has found that some communities are finding it more acceptable to be possessed than mentally ill. Exorcism: Mudasar Khan, pictured, believes a Jinn is causing his panic attacks and depression. An exorcism is pictured being performed where the exorcist reads passages from the Qur'an ‘Could be psychological problem but the one behind it is the Jinn because the","response":"Jinn can cause these issues,’ Mudasar Khan told Newsnight. ‘They can deceive doctors. They'll show symptoms similar to mental illness, but it's the Jinn that's causing it.’ The investigation revealed a worrying trend of families seeking exorcisms instead of medical treatment for mental illnesses, potentially delaying proper care and worsening the conditions of those afflicted. Mental health charities and experts have expressed concern over this trend and are urging families to seek professional help for their loved ones. In response to these findings, the National Health Service (NHS) and mental health organizations are working to raise awareness about mental health issues within British Asian communities and to debunk myths surrounding possession and exorcism. They emphasize the importance of seeking professional help and utilizing evidence-based treatments for mental illnesses rather than relying on exorcisms. There have also been reports of abuse and exploitation by some so-called healers, who prey on vulnerable individuals and families, charging exorbitant fees for their services. This has led to calls for stricter regulation of unlicensed practitioners, as well as better education on the subject for the general public. In conclusion, the rise of exorcisms as a treatment for mental health issues within British Asian communities is a deeply concerning trend. Mental health experts and organizations are actively working to increase awareness, educate the public on the dangers of exorcism as a treatment for mental illness, and encourage the seeking of professional help through evidence-based practices. It is essential for communities to recognize and support individuals struggling with mental health issues and to ensure that they have access to proper care and treatment."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.

Possible A: spain, bible, washington state, woods, orchard Why is \\"spain\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","response":"\\"Spain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of finding millions of apple trees due to a combination of factors, which include geography, agricultural history, and economic contributions. 1. Geography and Climate: Spain is located in southwestern Europe, with diverse climatic conditions spread across the country. The northern regions of Spain, including Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia, and Basque Country, as well as Catalonia, Aragon, and La Rioja, experience a suitable climate for growing apples. The combination of fertile soil, ample rainfall, and mild temperatures in these areas create ideal conditions for apple cultivation. 2. Agricultural History: Apples have been cultivated in Spain for centuries, and the country has a rich agricultural history with the fruit. The apple farming tradition is particularly strong in the northern regions, where multiple local apple varieties have been developed over time. This history displays the long-standing presence and significance of apple farming in Spain. 3. Production Volume: Spain is one of the largest apple producers in Europe, with an annual production that ranges between 500,000 to 1,000,000 metric tons. There are indeed millions of apple trees in the country, spread across various regions. These orchards not only supply the domestic market but are also a substantial source of export revenue for Spain. 4. Economic Contributions: Apples are an essential agricultural commodity in Spain, contributing significantly to the country's economy. The fruit is grown both for direct consumption as well as for value-added products, such as apple juice, cider, vinegar, and various confectionery items. Spain is also an important exporter of apples, with markets including European countries and others worldwide. This trade adds to the economic rationale for having millions of apple trees in Spain. In conclusion, Spain qualifies as an answer aligned with human common sense for the question of where millions of apple trees can be found due to the favorable geographic and climatic conditions for apple cultivation, the country's rich agricultural history involving apple farming, its large scale of production, and the economic significance of the apple industry for both domestic and international markets."},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B? A:","response":"In the scenarios described, the objects would be closer to each other in case A, where John used conduction for charging. This is because, in charging by conduction, the charged object must physically touch the uncharged object to transfer electrons and even out the charge on both objects. This direct contact is necessary for successful charging to occur. On the other hand, in case B, where John used induction for charging, the objects do not need to touch each other. Charging by induction is achieved merely by bringing the charged object close to the uncharged object, allowing a redistribution of electrons within the uncharged object, without any physical contact between the two objects. Therefore, in case B, the objects would be at a greater distance from each other compared to case A."},{"question":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the title of the person that the gun was illegally taken from after it was paid for? from the following article ?

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

A:","response":"Jamie Campbell Bower plays the character Caius in \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" which is the final installment of the Twilight Saga written by Stephenie Meyer. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn was split into two parts while being adapted into films – \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1\\" released in 2011 and \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2\\" in 2012. Jamie Campbell Bower portrayed the same character in both these films. Caius is one of the main antagonists in the series and a prominent member of the Volturi, the most powerful and influential coven of vampires. The Volturi serve as the de facto rulers and lawmakers of the vampire world. They reside in Volterra, Italy, and ensure that their existence remains a secret from humans. Caius, accompanied by Aro and Marcus, forms the core leadership of the Volturi coven. He is known for being ruthless, cruel, and merciless, which is demonstrated throughout the series through his actions, especially in \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" In \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" Jamie Campbell Bower's character Caius plays a crucial role in the story's climax, as he and the other Volturi members are misled to believe that Bella Swan (played by Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (played by Robert Pattinson) have created an immortal child named Renesmee (played by Mackenzie Foy). Immortal children are young, human-turned-vampires who are uncontrollable and often reveal the existence of their kind, putting the vampire world in danger. As a result, the Volturi enforce strict laws against creating immortal children, and those who defy the laws are punished severely. Caius pushes for the confrontation with the Cullens, intending to destroy their family and eliminate the alleged immortal child. However, upon arriving in Forks, Washington, the Volturi discover that Renesmee is not an immortal child but rather a unique hybrid born from a human mother and a vampire father. This revelation prevents an all-out battle between the two factions, as the Volturi, realizing they've been misled, decide to leave the Cullens in peace. Jamie Campbell Bower's portrayal of Caius in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was widely appreciated by the audience and fans of the Twilight Saga. His commitment to the character's dark nature added a sinister touch to the movie's plot, successfully capturing the essence of the villainous role that Caius played in the original novels."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is referring to a specific period in the United States when contraceptives were banned, particularly through their distribution via mail. However, to provide more context and a detailed, long answer, let's delve into the history of birth control legislation in the United States. The issue of birth control in the United States has a long and intricate history tied to legal, social, and religious issues. The Comstock Act of 1873 was a federal law prohibiting the distribution or mailing of any \\"obscene, lewd, or lascivious\\" materials, which included any form of birth control or information regarding it. Anthony Comstock, a social reformer of the time, advocated for and played a significant role in the implementation of this law. This federal law then became the basis for states to implement their own variations of the Comstock laws. Consequently, many states prohibited the use, sale, and distribution of contraceptives. It wasn't until the early 1900s that the birth control movement, led by figures such as Margaret Sanger, began advocating for women's rights to access contraceptives. The turning point in this issue began with the 1936 U.S. Court of Appeals case United States v. One Package. In this case, a package of contraceptives from Japan addressed to Margaret Sanger was seized by customs agents, leading to a legal battle over the interpretation of the Comstock Act. The court ruled that the federal law should not apply when the purpose of the contraception was \\"for the prevention of disease,\\" thus turning the tide in favor of the birth control movement. In 1965, the Griswold v. Connecticut Supreme Court case further shifted the legal landscape regarding birth control. This case challenged the constitutionality of a Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives, even for married couples. The court ruled that the ban violated the constitutional right to privacy, effectively overturning the law and paving the way for increased access to birth control across the country. In summary, while the Google answer you found is correct in referring to the distribution of contraceptives through the U.S. mails, it is essential to recognize the broader context of birth control bans throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. Significant shifts in legal decisions and social values over time contributed to the eventual dismantling and reformation of birth control laws in the United States."},{"question":"muir spent three years lecturing on mathematics at glasgow university and quickly gained a reputation as a fine teacher.

By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long.

Before the Labour Party rose in British politics, the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives. While coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics, the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament.
