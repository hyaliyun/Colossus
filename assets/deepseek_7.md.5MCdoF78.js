Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy. Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews. Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017. In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

What is the answer?","response":"Astraphobia refers to an irrational and intense fear of thunder and lightning. It is derived from the Greek words \\"Astrape\\" which means lightning and \\"Phobos\\" meaning fear. It is also known by several other names like Astrapophobia, Brontophobia, Tonitrophobia, or Keraunophobia. This fear is classified as a specific phobia under the broad umbrella of anxiety disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition) by the American Psychiatric Association. It should be noted that specific phobias are related to particular objects or situations. Therefore, a person suffering from Astraphobia has an excessive and persistent fear specifically of thunder and lightning. Astraphobia can occur in people of all age groups but is most commonly seen in children, possibly because their imagination and boundary-setting skills have not yet fully developed. This fear can be so severe that even a simple rain shower can cause significant anxiety, as the individual may fear that a thunderstorm may follow. During a storm, the astraphobic person might go to great lengths to seek shelter or hide from the situation, some might even close all windows, draw the curtains and might like to stay in a sound-proof space or a shelter. It's not known exactly why some people have this phobia, but as with other phobias, it could relate to a person's upbringing, personal experiences (like a traumatic event during a storm), or inherited traits, among other things. As with other phobias, this disorder can be treated using various options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, talk therapy, exposure therapy, or even medications in severe cases. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is often the preferred treatment because it involves helping the person change their thought patterns and reactions so that they can manage their fear better. In the case of astraphobia, treatment might also include exposure therapy, in which the person is gradually and repeatably exposed to the sounds and flashes of thunder and lightning, beginning firstly in a controlled environment, in the hopes of lessening their fear response over time. While having a fear of thunder and lightning is not uncommon, it only becomes a phobia when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects one's ability to function normally or disrupts daily life. In such instances, it is crucial to seek professional help."},{"question":"Question: What professional services network named London the world's capital of higher education?

The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6. It will no longer sue, as it had said it would do. Asiana says it wants to focus on supporting passengers and families. The crash killed three and injured dozens. Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names _ apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words _ on air and then apologized after a break. Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians. ||||| Two passengers aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed while landing in San Francisco have sued the carrier, claiming they suffered \\"extreme and catastrophic injuries and emotional distress\\" as a result of the accident. The suit is believed to be the first following the July 6 crash. A lawyer for Asiana didn't respond to a request for comment. Asiana flight 214 hit a sea wall in front of a runway at San Francisco International Airport and skidded to a stop before catching fire. Three passengers died and dozens more were injured. In their initial probe, National Transportation Safety Board investigators didn't find evidence of equipment malfunctions, agency Chairman Deborah Hersman said last week. The agency was looking into whether the pilots had received adequate training, according to people familiar with the investigation. Asiana officials have repeatedly said the pilots were both highly experienced and the airline's training programs meet all international and South Korean requirements. The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court by Younga Jun Machorro and her son, Benjamin Hyo-Ik Machorro. Also joining the suit was Hector Machorro, the husband of Younga and father of Benjamin, who wasn't aboard the flight. He claims losses stemming from his wife's injuries. \\"The conduct of Asiana's flight crew was egregiously reckless and negligent,\\" said Michael Verna of Bowles & Verna LLP, the Walnut Creek, Calif., lawyers for the plaintiffs. \\"These pilots were unable to do the most basic task—land on a runway in the middle of a clear day with no wind.\\" Mr. Verna said that both Ms. Machorro and her son were treated at San Francisco General Hospital after the crash. X-rays revealed no broken bones, said Mr. Verna, but both suffered injuries to their backs and were still undergoing treatment. Under an international treaty, Asiana, of South Korea, is liable for up to 150,000 in damages per injured passenger—damages that likely would be paid by the airline's insurers, legal experts said. Passengers might recover more if they can show the airline was at fault for the crash, as the Machorros allege. The crash \\"occurred due to the gross negligence and recklessness of the Asiana flight crew on Flight 214,\\" reads the complaint, \\"in woeful violation of numerous international and United States airline industry standards and established flight rules.\\" The Montreal Convention allows victims of the crash to sue Asiana in U.S. courts if they are permanent U.S. residents, purchased tickets in the U.S. or were flying into the U.S. as a final destination. All three plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, according to the suit. Litigation over air disasters typically takes months or longer to unfold. Often, lawsuits are consolidated and handled by a single federal judge, a process known as multidistrict litigation. Ladd Sanger, an aviation lawyer and commercially rated pilot in Dallas, said this would likely happen to any suits related to the Asiana incident. \\"We're going to see a lot of these filed in the weeks to come,\\" he said. \\"This is probably the first of many.\\" The crash has stoked a long-running debate over how aggressively plaintiff attorneys are permitted to seek out clients after an aviation tragedy. Federal law mandates what is effectively a 45-day moratorium, during which lawyers are barred from directly soliciting to represent commercial air-crash victims or their families. The restrictions often aren't enforced effectively, and veteran lawyers are replete with stories about how the rules have been skirted. But in the case of the Asiana crash, federal accident investigators and local law-enforcement appear to have tried particularly hard to make lawyers toe the line. James Kreindler, a veteran aviation litigator with the New York law firm Kreindler and Kreindler LLP, said he has never experienced such a show of force by local police to keep certain lawyers from entering the hotel where many family members were staying after the Asiana crash. \\"I've never seen such tight controls,\\" he said. \\"You couldn't get through the front door unless you had a prearranged meeting with a specific hotel guest.\\" Mr. Kreindler said he supports such restrictions because it prevents lawyers from trying to land clients with unfounded or exaggerated promises. The NTSB also stepped up its game. Several days after the crash, the agency's general counsel's office sent out a mass email to members of the San Francisco Bar Association about the 45-day rule. \\"We are closely following the activities of attorneys,\\" the message said, \\"and will immediately notify state bar ethics officials and other appropriate authorities if impermissible activity is suspected.\\" A spokeswoman for the NTSB said \\"it is typical for local law enforcement to secure the family center,\\" or hotel where family members are housed. —Joe Palazzolo and Jon Ostrower contributed to this article.

Kwon Yong Bok, director general of aviation safety policy at the transport ministry, said the government informed Asiana on April 30 it should hire more pilots, engineers and cabin crew as the airline planned to increase its fleet of airplanes by 20 percent by 2017. It currently has 80 planes. \\"We asked the company to review its safety policies once again,\\" Kwon said by phone. He said the ministry also recommended that Asiana centralize its safety management system and set up an oversight team for aircraft maintenance. The recommendations were made as part of a safety consulting program that the ministry set up for the airline industry to minimize the risk of accidents. Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed at San Francisco's international airport on July 6, killing three people and injuring dozens. Twelve people are still hospitalized including five cabin crew, South Korea's transport ministry said Monday. The crash of the Boeing 777 was Asiana's first accident since a cargo plane landed in waters near South Korea's Jeju island in 2011, killing two pilots. Its deadliest plane accident was in 1993 when a domestic flight crashed south of Seoul, killing 66 people. The cause of the San Francisco accident is still being probed but investigators have so far found no evidence of mechanical problems with the plane. ||||| A Chicago law firm has taken steps to sue Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, alleging that a malfunction of the plane's autothrottle may have caused the crash. Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery, which is meant to preserve evidence, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where the aircraft manufacturer is headquartered. The firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days. In addition to potential problems with the Boeing 777's auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seatbelts with a knife, the firm contends. Three Chinese teenage girls were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6, approached the runway too low and slow. The plane clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire. \\"We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,\\" attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement. Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment. The petition asks a judge to order Boeing to identify the designer and manufacturer of the airplane's autothrottle and its emergency evacuation slides. It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground. Kelly said the firm wants to protect the wreckage \\"from destructive testing\\" and to obtain maintenance records, internal memos and other evidence. A passenger filed a lawsuit against Asiana in San Francisco federal court on Monday, saying the airline showed \\"wanton and willful disregard for the rights and safety of all passengers,\\" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Younga Jun Machorro and her 8-year-old son, Benjamin Machorro, were seated toward the front of the plane and both suffered back and neck injuries, their lawyer, Michael Verna, told the newspaper. The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 have told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed. Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been \\"armed,\\" or made ready for activation, but investigators are still determining whether it had been engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board has said. Two of the plane's eight slides malfunctioned, opening inside the cabin and pinning two flight attendants underneath. ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, seen at San Francisco International Airport, in San Francisco, Friday, July 12, 2013.

Paxton Lynch was the team's leading rusher, with only 20 yards. On the Raiders' second offensive possession, a brawl erupted between cornerback Aqib Talib and Raiders' wide receiver Michael Crabtree, resulting in both players being ejected from the game. Raiders' guard Gabe Jackson was also ejected for making contact with an official during the brawl. After a strip sack and forced fumble off quarterback Derek Carr deep in Raiders' territory, the Broncos had a first and goal at the 1-yard line, however, Paxton Lynch threw a pass that was deflected and intercepted by linebacker NaVorro Bowman in the end zone. A 9-yard touchdown pass from Carr to wide receiver Amari Cooper, coupled with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Marshawn Lynch, gave the Raiders a 14-0 lead before halftime. The lead was increased to 21-0 early in the third quarter, with a 6-yard touchdown pass from Carr to running back Jalen Richard. After Paxton Lynch suffered an ankle injury, he was replaced by Trevor Siemian late in the third quarter, and got the Broncos on the scoreboard at the 10:26 mark of the fourth quarter, with a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cody Latimer. The Raiders drove to the Broncos' 17-yard line on their next possession, chewing up nearly five minutes off the clock, and were attempting to add to their lead. However, a 35-yard field goal attempt by placekicker Giorgio Tavecchio missed wide left. Siemian engineered a 12-play, 75-yard drive and pulled the Broncos to within a 21-14 deficit with 2:44 remaining in the game, after a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bennie Fowler III. The Broncos were hoping for a defensive stop just before the two-minute warning, but after using the last two of their three team timeouts, Carr connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson on a 3rd-and-8, sealing the win for the Raiders.

To understand how this could happen, let's first explore the reasons behind fewer embryos developing and the role that nests play in the birds' life cycle: 1. Reasons for fewer embryos developing: There could be various factors leading to fewer embryos developing in bird eggs, such as a decline in food availability, environmental changes, pollution, genetic factors, or the presence of predators. 2. Role of nests in the bird life-cycle: Birds build nests primarily for two reasons - to lay their eggs and raise their offspring until they are able to fend for themselves. Depending on the species, nests can range from simple depressions in the ground to elaborate constructions made from sticks, grasses, mud, and other materials. Nests provide shelter and protection for the eggs and young birds, helping to increase the chances of their survival. Now, let's analyze how fewer embryos developing could affect the size and number of nests being built: A. Smaller nests: If fewer embryos develop due to a decline in food availability, environmental changes, or other factors, birds might lay fewer eggs. This could lead to a reduced need for larger nests, as it would be easier for the parent birds to keep the smaller number of eggs and hatchlings warm and protected. As a result, birds may build smaller nests that are still suitable for raising their reduced number of offspring. B. Fewer nests: In situations where there are fewer embryos developing due to genetic factors, it could lead to an overall decline in the bird population. As a consequence, there would be fewer birds looking for nesting sites, which could lead to fewer nests being built. Additionally, if predators are causing a decline in bird populations, birds may choose to build fewer nests in order to minimize the risk of their eggs and hatchlings being discovered and eaten by predators. C. No effect: In some cases, the size and number of nests in a bird population might not be affected at all by a reduction in embryos developing. Some bird species are known to have what is called \\"nest site fidelity,\\" meaning that they return to the same nesting site year after year, and if the location has been successfully used in the past, it could lead to the building of nests regardless of the number of embryos developing. In conclusion, fewer embryos developing in bird eggs can potentially lead to the construction of smaller or fewer nests, depending on the underlying causes and the specific bird species involved. However, in some cases, there may be no direct effect on the size or number of nests built by birds."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly The answer to this question is:","response":"Elderly adults reach the end of their life cycle."},{"question":"- Encourager la transparence de l'information relative aux possibilités et aux structures en matière d'éducation et de formation, en vue de la création d'un espace éducatif ouvert en Europe. - Promouvoir la dimension européenne de l'enseignement et de la formation.

Coroner recorded an open verdict.","response":"Title: Unveiling the Tragic Story of Linzi Mannion: A Tale of Undisclosed Sorrow Lance Sergeant Robert Kopicki faced one of the darkest and most tragic moments of his life when he discovered the lifeless body of Linzi Mannion, a tale that continues to cast a pall of sorrow and distress over a community still grappling with the loss. The untimely passing of Miss Mannion, a woman whose life was marred by a lingering cloud of depression lurking behind her perceived happiness, serves as a stark reminder of the invisible battles many continue to fight in silence. A life marked by extremes, Linzi Mannion transitioned from the joy of new motherhood to the depths of depression. Friends, family, and even the inquest were told that Miss Mannion's downward spiral into despair became apparent only after the birth of her daughter. It's a narrative that is all too common, as postnatal depression continues to be a silent assailant on many new mothers, attributable to a combination of hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, and fatigue. It is reported that Mannion received medical attention for her condition, but the depth and vagacity of her internal turmoil were under-realized. Those closest to Linzi, stunned by her passing, say she gave no indication she was contemplating harming herself. They testify to her composed exterior and how skilfully she masked her internal strife. In many ways, this makes Linzi’s story all the more heart-wrenching. Her ability to maintain a façade of normalcy, even when grappling with dark thoughts, underscores the devastating complexity of mental health issues. It highlights the fact that even those who may outwardly appear joyous and content can be silently battling immense emotional pain. It serves as a potent reminder that we must take extra care in understanding, recognising, and supporting those, who behind their brave smiles and buoyant demeanour, could be waging a secret war against depression and despair. Following a comprehensive review of the circumstances surrounding Miss Mannion's demise, the coroner recorded an open verdict. This means that even after an in-depth investigation, given the existing evidence, the coroner could not definitively categorize Mannion’s death as suicide, accident or another cause. It is an unsatisfactory ending to a distressing sequence of events that started with joy and ended in grief. As a society, it is our duty to work towards dispelling the stigma that continues to shroud mental health, a daunting villain that took from us, Linzi Mannio, a loving mother and a cherished friend. This tragic story should further propel the conversation about mental health, underlining the importance of providing better support structures, improving mental health education and raising awareness for postnatal depression.

Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Ablett signed a one-year contract for the 1984 season with Geelong, and he began his first season under the guidance of Tom Hafey. He debuted for the Cats in Round 7 and after just nine games on the wing, Ablett was selected to his first State of Origin game for Victoria. Ablett earned best-on-ground honours after kicking 8 goals from the half-forward flank. He played 15 games and kicked 33 goals in the 1984 season, and was awarded the Carji Greeves Medal as the Geelong Football Club's \\"best and fairest\\" player of the year. Following his first season with Geelong, Ablett signed a new three-year contract with the club. Playing mostly on the half forward flank, Ablett won the club's goalkicking award for the following two seasons with 82 and 65 goals respectively. Although Ablett had developed a reputation for his laconic, lazy attitude to training under coach John Devine, this did not prevent him from earning top three placings in the best and fairest awards from 1985-87. With his contract expiring at the conclusion of the 1987 season, Ablett shocked the VFL by signing a new five-year contract with his former club, Hawthorn. After a \\"cooling-off\\" period, however, Ablett opted to remain with Geelong by agreeing to a lucrative five-year contract that tied him to the club for the long-term. Ablett began the 1988 season with 59 goals after just 11 games, placing him second on the goalkicking list behind Hawthorn's Jason Dunstall. In these games, he kicked 10 goals against Richmond in the Anzac Day game, and 11 against Brisbane--one shy of breaking the ground record of 12 goals at Carrara. Although he missed out on State honours and failed to place within the top three in the club best and fairest award, Ablett finished with 82 goals during the season for the second time in his career.","response":"This text is about Gary Ablett, an Australian rules football player who played for the Geelong Football Club."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: - caps is 61 347 11 - nationalyears is 2008 -- - ntupdate is 30 july 2015 - birth date is 10 april 1982 - clubs is toluca → uanl -lrb- loan -rrb- - nationalcaps is 17 - currentclub is toluca - height is 1.70 m ftin 0 on - nationalgoals is 0 - nationalteam is mexico - birth place is tlalpujahua , mexico - position is winger - fullname is carlos esquivel silva - image size is 220px - years is 2005 -- 2008 - clubnumber is 11 - pcupdate is 31 august 2015 - image is esquiveltoluca.jpg - goals is 4 35 2 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did Christ seem to have left the world?\\" is \\"After hundreds of years passed, Christ did not return\\"? -no -yes","response":"Yes, according to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did Christ seem to have left the world?\\" is \\"After hundreds of years passed, Christ did not return.\\" The early Christians believed that Jesus would return during their lifetime, but as time went on and He did not come, they began to feel abandoned and sad. This prolonged absence led them to believe Christ had left the world, and their faith became increasingly mournful as they continued to wait for His return."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen. She takes Tom to her palace and cuts Ellie off of her sled, causing her to fall onto a talking bird named Peeps. Ellie goes out to save Tom from her and Peeps reluctantly decides to go with her. In a snowy forest, they find a house belonging to an old woman, who appears nice, but is actually an evil witch but traps them to use Ellie's heart for her elixir of life so she can be eternally young. Peeps tricks the witch's cat, Cuddles, into chasing after him and knocking over the elixir of life, and uses the confusion to unlocks Ellie's cell. Ellie and Peeps escape and trap the witch in the basement.

What is made up of people? Options: - buildings - audience - apartment - classroom - falling down","response":"All right, let's go through the options one by one and reason them: 1. Buildings: Buildings are structures that people live or work in, but they themselves are not made up of people. So, this option can be eliminated. 2. Audience: An audience is a group of people who have gathered to watch or listen to a performance, presentation, or event. It's a collection of individuals, so this option is a strong contender. 3. Apartment: Similar to buildings, apartments are residential spaces within a building where people live but are not composed of people. Therefore, this option can be eliminated. 4. Classroom: A classroom is a room where learning takes place and consists of both a teacher and students. It can be considered a space made up of people coming together for a purpose, making it a potential candidate. 5. Falling down: This is an action or event, not a group of people. So, this option can be eliminated. Out of the given options, audience (option 2) and classroom (option 4) are the two most closely related to being \\"made up of people\\". However, the term \\"audience\\" specifically refers to a group of people, while \\"classroom\\" primarily denotes the physical space (although it can also be used to describe the group of people within the room). Due to its stronger focus on the people themselves, option 2 (audience) is the most accurate answer."},{"question":"Complete the following sentence.

Step 1: Read and analyze the given sentence. I read the given sentence and understood that it has two contrasting reactions to the statues of angels in the psychic medium's house by the characters Randy and Joseph. Randy feels spooked, whereas Joseph smiles, and the sentence needs to be completed by mentioning the reason for Joseph's reaction. Step 2: Use context to determine a reason for Joseph's reaction. Since the sentence provides no information on why Joseph feels that way, I created a reason based on the fact that the angels are involved. I connected Joseph's pleasant reaction to a memory of a loved one who had a fondness for angels. Step 3: Compose the sentence completion. I connected the memory to Joseph's late grandmother who had a strong belief in guardian angels and their protective power, providing an emotional touch and explaining his quiet smile."},{"question":"Question: Information: - Graham Linehan (born 22 May 1968) is an Irish television comedy writer and director who, often in partnership with Arthur Mathews, has written or co-written a number of popular television comedies. He is most noted for the sitcoms \\"Father Ted\\", \\"Black Books\\" and \\"The IT Crowd\\". Amongst others, he has also worked on \\"Big Train\\", \\"Count Arthur Strong\\", \\"Brass Eye\\" and \\"The Fast Show\\". - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - \`\` Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep '' is the second episode of the third series of the Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted .

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL represented the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Ayrshire is a historic county in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde. It is also, under the name the County of Ayr, a registration county. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800. - The Old Firm is the collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, who are both based in Glasgow. The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as \\"like two old, firm friends\\", and represents the commercial benefits of the two clubs' rivalry. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original 11 members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890. The rivalry between the two clubs has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture and has contributed to the political, social and religious division in Scotland and also beyond, especially in neighbouring Northern Ireland. As a result, the fixture was recognised as having enduring appeal. - The Scottish Junior Football Association (\\"SJFA\\" for short) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term \\"junior\\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that non-league football in Scotland is not similarly integrated into its football league system. Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by three regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland's national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 188081 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season. - The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship. - Robert Stevenson \`\` Bobby '' Donnelly ( born 19 January 1987 ) is a Scottish professional footballer currently playing as a defender for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the Scottish Junior Football Association , West Region . He has previously played in the Scottish Premier League for Motherwell . - Girvan (\\"mouth of the River Girvan\\") is a burgh in Carrick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Girvan is stituated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland. - South Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland, covering the southern part of Ayrshire. It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. South Ayrshire Council is a Conservative controlled council. The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington - located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick - being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the Firth of Clyde. - The Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region is one of three regions of the SJFA which organise their own distinct league and cup competitions. The SJFA used to be split into six regions, but in 2002 they took the decision to reform into three to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues.

However, I was surprised to learn that even in a classroom with fewer students, social segregation happened. The entire class crowded around a table just to avoid one or two other students sitting by themselves on the other side of the room. Students refer to one as the \\"cool\\" one and another as the \\"loser\\". There were only three tables. After witnessing this, I made a new classroom rule. Every day at lunch, we would put all the tables together and everyone including me would sit around the big table. Students could sit wherever they wanted at the table. This way, no one was excluded from the group. At first, there was much grumbling at this. But gradually the complaining stopped. Students who didn't usually talk to each other during free time started to share conversations. Students were occasionally requested to bring something for others to taste. This started a new tradition: weekly food sharing. In other situations, students make unpleasant comments about their classmate's food, but not during these lunches. Students were careful to thank the sharer, even if they didn't like the offering. Many students tried a food they had never tried before and some cooked a family recipe with their parents for the first time. Eating together gave us the opportunity to practice social graces .

Article: Do you want to live a happier, less stressful life? Try laughing for no reason at all. That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world. The first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995, by Dr Madan Kataria. \\"Children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\\" says Dr Kataria. \\"Everyone's naturally good at laughing -- it's the universal language.\\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide. Many doctors are also interested in the effects of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLS School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%. So what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to the nearest club in the south of London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. I had no interest in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid . Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \\"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\\" while looking at each other. Although we couldn't tell the differences between _ laughter and real laughter, they still produced the same healthy effects. Surprisingly, it worked! After ten minutes, everybody there was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was shocked by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. Question: The writer was nervous at the beginning of the class because _ .

We can do that by subtracting 13,515 from both sides (just like when we're playing a game and we need to keep things fair and equal). If we subtract 13,515 from -915, now we get -14430. So, the problem is now -14430 = -1443 * g. Now, we only have to find the value of 'g'. For that, we divide -14430 by -1443.

Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. A:","response":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma as compared to Tree City. The primary reason for this conclusion lies in the difference in their approaches to energy consumption and environmental protection. Tree City, as mentioned, burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels. The burning of such fuels leads to higher levels of air pollution, releasing harmful gases and particulate matter into the atmosphere. Air pollution is known to have severe negative effects on human health, including an increased risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Additionally, air pollution can exacerbate other health issues and puts children at a higher risk due to their developing lungs and higher air intake relative to their size. On the other hand, Leaf City was very protective towards its environment. This implies that the city followed practices that minimized the reliance on fossil fuels, leading to lower levels of air pollution and, consequently, a lower risk of exposure to asthma for its inhabitants. By adopting environmentally friendly policies and practices, Leaf City ensured better air quality for its residents and reduced the likelihood of adverse health effects related to poor air quality. Therefore, given the difference in environmental policies and the direct relationship between air pollution and asthma, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma compared to Tree City."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Odeon Greenwich for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Context: Patch's mother was named Silver, because high summer sun made her fur shine that colour. She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded. Question: Why Patch's tail felt stiffen?

What reviews supported this critic consensus?","response":"The critic consensus for the movie adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's novel refers to the overall sentiment shared by numerous critics and reviewers regarding the film's style, execution, and faithfulness to the source material. Based on this consensus, it seems that the film has its merits as an adaptation, but may not stand out as particularly engaging or innovative. To understand how some reviews supported this consensus, let us take a closer look at the opinions of various critics. 1. Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Although this adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's popular children's book remains faithful to the source material, it ends up feeling like a relic from a bygone era of family-friendly entertainment. It's charming and heartfelt, but ultimately forgettable.\\" 2. Sheri Linden from the Los Angeles Times mentioned, \\"The film is beautifully crafted, with detailed period settings and strong performances, but unfortunately falls short of delivering the emotional depth and impact that DiCamillo's novel achieved.\\" 3. Richard Brody from The New Yorker observed, \\"While the film accurately captures the spirit and warmth of the novel with a talented ensemble cast, it does little to give the adaptation its own unique voice, resulting in a comfortable, but somewhat unremarkable, viewing experience.\\" 4. Tara Brady from The Irish Times commented, \\"A faithful adaptation that serves as a gentle and heartwarming family film. However, the movie doesn't carve out an adventurous or distinct identity, instead playing it safe with a more traditional approach that, though enjoyable, leaves audiences wanting more.\\" 5. Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian noted, \\"An earnest and well-intentioned adaptation of Kate DiCamillo's novel, but its old-fashioned sensibilities and straightforward storytelling don't quite make a mark in today's more sophisticated cinematic landscape.\\" These reviews collectively support the critic consensus by acknowledging the film's adherence to the novel's storyline and themes, as well as praising its performances and family-friendly appeal. However, they also emphasize the film's lack of innovation and contemporary flair, which results in it being perceived as \\"bland\\" or \\"forgettable\\" when compared to more dynamic and engaging adaptations in recent years. Overall, while the film may satisfy fans of the original novel, it struggles to meet the expectations of an audience that is accustomed to more inventive and engaging cinematic storytelling."},{"question":"Q: Fact 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. Fact 2: Sexual reproduction involves sperm and an egg. Given the two facts above, what reproduces sexually? A:","response":"Given Fact 1: Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm and Fact 2: Sexual reproduction involves sperm and an egg, it can be concluded that sponges reproduce sexually. Sponges encompass a diverse group of sessile aquatic animals belonging to the phylum Porifera. They are found in various habitats, including oceans and freshwater sources, and exhibit a range of forms and structures. Sponges exhibit a unique and relatively simple body plan, comprising a network of canals and specialized cells called choanocytes which help in filtering water for nutrients. Reproduction in sponges can occur both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction involves budding, fragmentation, or the formation of specialized structures called gemmules. These methods involve the growth of new individuals from a fragment or an outgrowth of the parent sponge without the fusion of sperm and egg. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, is the process in which two haploid gametes (sperm and egg) fuse to form a diploid zygote, which subsequently develops into a new individual. In sponges, sexual reproduction typically involves a single adult sponge functioning as a hermaphrodite, producing both eggs and sperm, although some species have separate male and female individuals. The production of both gamete types usually occurs sequentially to reduce the likelihood of self-fertilization, although cross-fertilization between different individuals is more common. The sperm cells are released into the water column, where they are captured by other sponges through their water filtration system. The sperm cells then travel through the canals of the recipient sponge, fertilizing the eggs internally. Fertilized eggs develop into ciliated, free-swimming larvae called parenchymella, which are eventually released into the water. The larvae float in the water column, seeking a suitable substrate to attach and metamorphose into a new adult sponge, thereby completing the life cycle. In summary, sponges are capable of reproducing sexually, as evidenced by the fact that adult sponges produce eggs and sperm (Fact 1), and sexual reproduction involves the fusion of sperm and an egg (Fact 2). This mode of reproduction enables genetic diversity and adaptation to different environmental conditions, providing sponges with an evolutionary advantage in their various habitats."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you are given two sentences in Persian separated with <sep>, and you have to determine whether the sentences are paraphrases or not.

In general, the new books tend to place greater blame on Israel for the Palestinian problem - as well as for the turmoil, the human cost and the continued political impasse in the Middle East - than have most earlier Israeli studies. Three books, all of which have exploited newly available documents, raise a host of questions about the period when Israel came into existence as an independent state, fighting a victorious war over neighboring Arab countries while roughly 700,000 Palestinian left their homes. Many of the Palestinians ended up in refugee districts, where they remain, their sense of grievance a contributing factor in the violence in the occupied territiories that began in December. One of the books, ''The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities'' by Simha Flapan, is viewed by Middle East specialists here as militantly anti-Zionist, a book designed to erode one of the major Western perceptions of the Israeli-Arab conflict - the notion that Israel has always held itself to a higher moral standard than its neighbors did. A new book by Bennie Morris, the diplomatic correspondent for The Jerusalem Post, entitled ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,'' examines the departure of Arabs from Israeli controlled territory on a city by city and village by village basis, and concludes that there were a host of factors that led to the exodus. Israeli Scholar at Oxford In ''Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, The Zionist Movement, and the Partition of Palestine,'' Avi Shlaim, an Israeli scholar who is a fellow of St. Antony's College at Oxford, recounts in detail the story of early Jordanian-Israeli relations. Taken together, the books seem to continue a trend toward a more self-critical approach on the part of Israeli students of the Middle East conflict, an area in which much previous scholarship tended to present one side or the other in the conflict as the repository of pure good or of unadulterated evil. ''In the 1950's and 1960's, the histories were extreme on both sides,'' Daniel Pipes, the director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a Middle East scholar, said. ''The scholarship of today is much more nuanced. The Israeli side ranges from mildly self-critical to heavily self-critical, and even on the Arab side there is somewhat less of a tendency to parrot the party line. ''It was a complex human situation,'' Mr. Pipes said of the birth of Israel. ''Mistakes, evil and virtue existed on both sides, though perhaps not in equal proportion.'' ''All this interest in the 1948 period,'' Mr. Pipes said, ''is due to the fact that the Arab-Israeli conflict has gone back to where it was. It was primarly then between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Then, after that, all the other states got involved. Now, it's reverted to where it was before.'' The Palestinian Flight Among the key events scrutinized in the books are the Palestinian flight from the territory brought under Jewish control and the invasion of Israel by five Arab armies the day after independence was declared. Mr. Flapan, whose book was published by Pantheon in this country, argues that earlier Israeli beliefs about these and other events amount to ''myths'' whose effect was to cover up Israeli responsibility. In all, Mr. Flapan, a Polish-born early Zionist pioneer who died last year, identifies seven such ''myths,'' among them the contention that the flight of Palestinians from Jewish areas ''came in response to a call by the Arab leadership to leave temporarily, in order to return with the victorious Arab armies.'' Mr. Flapan argues that the Palestinian exodus was both desired and prompted by Jewish leaders ''who believed that Zionist colonization and statehood necessitated the 'transfer' of Palestinian Arabs to Arab countries.'' His argument is that despite public statements by Israel's leaders to the effect that all Arabs living in Israeli territory were urged to stay, their real motivation was to reduce Arab numbers as far as possible. Mr. Flapan's book has been criticized by other scholars who say, among other things, that it marks a growing tendency both among Israelis and foreigners to scrutinize Israeli behavior and actions far more than those of any other country. In the view of the critics, the mere notion that Israeli Jews, who, in their view, were fighting for their lives, sometimes behaved in a less than exemplary manner should not come as a shocking revelation. Called Product of Warfare Other recent studies, while also critical of Israeli behavior and policy, stop far short of some of Mr. Flapan's conclusions. The Morris book - ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949,'' - contends that both the conventional Arab view of the exodus - that it was caused by Jewish aggression - and the Israeli ''myth'' -that it was urged on the Palestinian population by Arab leaders - are incorrect. The exodus emerges in Mr. Morris's view as an almost inevitable product of ''civil and guerrilla warfare between the two highly intermingled communities.''

(Associated Press) Central American girls, who are traveling with a caravan of Central American migrants, play in the patio of the Viña de Cristo shelter while their parents organize accommodations for the night in Tijuana, Mexico, Wednesday, April 25, 2018. The caravan of mainly Central American migrants are planning... (Associated Press) TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) — About 130 Central Americans, mostly women and children, have arrived at the U.S. border with Mexico in a \\"caravan\\" of asylum-seeking immigrants that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump. Two busloads arrived late Tuesday in the Mexican border city of Tijuana at two migrant shelters just steps from one of the most fortified stretches of border separating the U.S. from Mexico. They joined another 50 or so who arrived in Tijuana over the last week or two. Four more busloads of about 200 Central Americans — mostly women and children but including some men — were expected to arrive in Tijuana Wednesday, said Alex Mensing, project coordinator for Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which is organizing the effort. U.S. lawyers planned to lead clinics later this week on U.S. asylum law to tell the immigrants what to expect when they seek asylum. The first groups plan to try to enter the U.S. on Sunday at San Diego's border crossing. Trump and senior aides have portrayed the caravans and the asylum seekers as evidence of a dysfunctional border and a serious threat. The president tweeted this week that he has issued orders \\"not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace.\\" The caravans have been a fairly common tactic for years among advocacy groups to bring attention to Central American citizens seeking asylum in the U.S. to escape political persecution or criminal threats from gangs. But the latest one drew more attention because Trump's attention from almost the moment it began March 25 in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemalan border. And while it slowly traveled across Mexico. Trump used it as an example to try to win more support for his planned border wall — even though the asylum-seekers plan to turn themselves in to border inspectors. Taxi driver Jovanne Torres from El Salvador said Wednesday after arriving in Tijuana Tuesday that Trump's attacks on the caravan makes him doubt whether he'll succeed in getting asylum for himself, his wife and his daughters ages 4 and 10 months — but he still plans to try. Torres, 37, said he fled his hometown near the country's capital of San Salvador and joined the caravan days after a gang threatened to kill him and his wife when he refused to give a free ride to a gang member. He thinks he could be killed if he goes home and decided against seeking asylum in Mexico because he wants to join relatives in Houston. \\"Trump's words have made it difficult for us,\\" he said. This caravan's numbers pale compared to the roughly 200,000 people who were arrested at the border in Texas' Rio Grande Valley during the spring of 2014 during the administration of President Barack Obama, many of them Central American women and children. Thousands of Haitians seeking to enter the U.S. turned themselves in to U.S. border inspectors at the Tijuana-San Diego border crossing, the nation's busiest. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has space to hold about 300 people at the crossing, said Pete Flores, director of the agency's San Diego field office. It turns them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine if they should be held long-term of if they can be released while their cases are pending, often wearing ankle monitors that track their movements. The San Diego border crossing was so overwhelmed by Haitians in 2016 that U.S. officials worked with their Mexican counterparts to create a ticketing system that let the Haitians in over time. Some waited their turn in Tijuana more than five weeks. More recently, asylum seekers have had to wait at most only a few hours, never overnight, Flores said. If asylum-seekers make it through initial screenings with asylum officers by establishing \\"credible fear\\" of being returned to their homelands, they are allowed in and face what can be lengthy proceedings before U.S. immigration judges. Ginger Jacobs, a San Diego immigration attorney who helped Haitians seeking entry to the U.S. in 2016, said Trump's concerns about a rush of Central Americans seeking asylum were \\"completely overblown.\\" \\"I don't see this caravan thing being a big deal,\\" she said. \\"I see it as something the port will be able to handle competently and professionally.\\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, in a message apparently aimed at asylum seekers, said Wednesday that anyone who makes false claims to immigration authorities is subject to criminal prosecution. The same goes for anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims. Nielsen's threat is consistent with the administration's narrative of widespread \\"asylum fraud\\" and claims that asylum-seekers are coached on what to tell U.S. authorities. The secretary also said asylum seekers in the caravan should seek protection in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he may assign additional immigration judges to handle caravan cases. The Juventud 2000 migrant shelter, on the edge of Tijuana's red-light district, is filled with dome-shaped tents to accommodate more than 200 arrivals. Its director, Jose Maria Garcia Luca, said two previous caravans in May and November of last year had about 100 people each. Those who sought asylum reported no significant delays entering the U.S. \\"This is nothing like the Haitians,\\" Garcia Luca said. \\"That was chaos.\\" |||||","response":"About 130 Central Americans consisting mostly of women and children arrived at the U.S. border with Mexico in a \\"caravan\\" of asylum-seeking immigrants that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump.

The earthquake did indeed measure 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and lasted around 10–15 seconds. As for the survivors, the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake led to multiple responses including recovery efforts, financial assistance, and changes in building codes to minimize damages in future earthquakes. Here's a brief summary of what happened to survivors: 1. Immediate earthquake response: Emergency services, organizations, and volunteers provided aid by rescuing trapped individuals, offering medical assistance, and securing damaged infrastructure. 2. Government and financial assistance: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Emergency Services, the Small Business Administration, and other government agencies provided financial resources to affected individuals and businesses for rebuilding and recovery. 3. Emotional support: Mental health services, counseling, and support groups were provided to help earthquake survivors cope with the trauma, loss, and emotional impact of the disaster. 4. Updated building codes: After the earthquake, local and state officials revised building codes to enhance safety and seismic resilience in newer constructions. The goal was to prevent extensive damages and fatalities in future earthquakes. The lives of the survivors of the 1989 California earthquake varied greatly, and their specific experiences depended on multiple factors like personal situations, economic status, and the level of support they received in the aftermath of the disaster. In general, survivors had to rebuild their lives and adapt to the changes brought about by the major disaster."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MK was in essence a political pressure group rather than a true political party, with members being able to join other political parties as well. It campaigned for the establishment of a Cornish University, a Cornish Industrial Board, and the repatriation of Heligoland Fresians whose land was used by the British government as a bombing range in the mid-1950s. It published numerous policy papers to support its positions. MK gained popularity in the 1960s, when it campaigned against 'overspill' housing developments in Cornwall to accommodate incomers from Greater London. In April 1967, Colin Murley was elected for MK onto Cornwall County Council for the seat of St Day and Lanner; he had stood on an anti-overspill platform. In 1968, the first edition of Cornish Nation was published; this is the party's magazine. However, by the 1970s the group developed into a more coherent and unified organisation. During this decade, MK began contesting Westminster parliamentary seats as well as local government ones. It held rallies in support of Cornwall's fishing industry and against regional unemployment and nuclear waste; in the 1980s, these rallies were aggravated by the policies of the incumbent Thatcher government. The party grew to become the leading champion for Cornish nationalism, superceding the Stannary Parliament in this respect. The party opposed the Common Market.

The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca.

With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British.

Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country. Operations against Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz were successful. Air attacks sank 39,126 long tons (39,754 t) of shipping, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392 t) damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians. Other sources point to half of the port's 144 berths rendered unusable, while cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged amounting to 80,000 long tons (81,000 t). Around 66,000 houses were destroyed, 77,000 people made homeless, and 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night. Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale.

The origin of the word tennis goes back to the French term \\"tenez.\\" The history of tennis is quite fascinating and spans centuries, with its roots dating back to ancient times. The term \\"tenez\\" was used by the French in the 11th or 12th century when the sport first emerged as \\"jeu de paume\\" or the game of palm. In this early version of tennis, players would use their bare hands, or later, a padded glove, to strike a ball back and forth over a net or a marked space. As the game evolved, racquets were introduced - making it more recognizable as the sport we know today. Players would begin each point by shouting \\"tenez,\\" which means \\"take it\\" or \\"play,\\" to their opponent to indicate they were about to serve the ball. Given the popularity of the sport among French-speaking nobility, it is believed that the word tennis originated from the repeated use of this term. Tennis began to gain widespread attention and enthusiasm throughout Europe between the 16th and 17th centuries. It was during this time that the sport was often referred to as \\"royal tennis.\\" Many famous historical figures, including kings, popes, and other members of the nobility, were known to have been avid tennis players. The modern game of tennis, with the rules and equipment we are familiar with now, began to emerge in the late 19th century, as the sport's popularity spread to other English-speaking countries like the United States, Australia, and England. Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, a British army officer, played a crucial role in modernizing the sport in 1873 when he patented a game called \\"scriber,\\" which consisted of an hourglass-shaped court, a net, and the use of rubber balls. This game was designed to be adaptable to different outdoor environments and was easily playable in lawns or gardens, as the name \\"lawn tennis\\" suggests. As tennis continued to evolve, so did its rules and regulations. In 1877, the first Wimbledon championship took place in London, paving the way for the future of the sport, including global competitions and grand slam tournaments. Today, tennis is enjoyed and played by millions worldwide, both as a recreational activity and as a professional sport."},{"question":"Southeast European Times (İstanbul) için Menekşe Tokyay'ın haberi - 20/07/11 Could you please translate this to English?","response":"\\"Southeast European Times (Istanbul) - Menekse Tokyay's news article - 20/07/11\\" Step 1: Identify the language: The given text is in Turkish.

In this context, the correct answer from the given choices is \\"plants.\\" Photosynthesis plays a critical role in the Earth's ecosystem, as it helps maintain a balance in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and produces oxygen, which is essential for life. Additionally, photosynthesis serves as the primary energy source for food chains, as plants are the primary producers. During photosynthesis, specialized cells within the plant, containing organelles called chloroplasts, capture solar energy through pigments like chlorophyll. This solar energy drives a series of light-dependent reactions that generate high-energy molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These compounds serve as the energy source for the subsequent steps in the process, known as the light-independent reactions or the Calvin Cycle. Within the Calvin Cycle, carbon dioxide is assimilated into an organic molecule through a process called carbon fixation. This step involves the enzyme RuBisCo (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), which is the most abundant protein on Earth. The resulting organic molecules then undergo a series of complex transformations, ultimately producing carbohydrates like glucose and other sugars. These carbohydrates serve as energy storage for the plants and can be used for growth, maintenance, or reproduction. In summary, photosynthesis is when plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates and oxygen. This vital process enables plants to produce their food, release oxygen into the atmosphere, and support various ecosystems."},{"question":"late, when we compare with the first dates published in may, that suggested mid august, the earliest vendange in anyone's memory.

However, I found that the appliance struggled to maintain a consistent temperature, and it ended up overcooking my meals on multiple occasions. 2. Build quality: One of the first things I noticed was the flimsy construction of the appliance. The buttons felt cheap, and the handle on the frying lid broke after just a few uses. 3. Noise: The appliance created an unusually loud noise when operating, which made cooking a less enjoyable experience. It was nearly impossible to hold a conversation in the kitchen with it running in the background. 4. Size: While I appreciate that multi-functional kitchen appliances often require more space, this package was excessively large for my small kitchen counter. I found it cumbersome to store and to use. 5. Cleanup: Cleaning the appliance after use was a tedious process, primarily due to the many removable and hard-to-reach parts. I spent much longer cleaning up than I would like to admit. Overall, I cannot recommend the SmartChef 5-in-1 kitchen appliance. The combination of poor performance, low-quality construction, noise, size, and tedious cleanup make this a product I regret purchasing.\\""},{"question":"In this task, you are given a hateful post in Bengali that expresses hate or encourages violence in a geopolitical context based on the protected characteristics such as race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.

It is the story of a young boy named Pi who spends 227 days at sea with a small group of animals after disaster strikes their ship and is an account of his journey of survival and hardship. Piscine \\"Pi\\" Molitor Patel, on whom Life of Pi is based, is a young boy living in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home. However, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan , an injured zebra, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now. In an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive. The life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone. After the Mexicans refuse to believe Pi's story, he changes his tale by replacing the animals with his mother, a cook and a sailor and asks the Mexicans which one they prefer.

Let's break it down to understand the phrase better. 1. \\"acidic all-male all about eve\\": This part of the phrase is a reference to the 1950 film \\"All About Eve\\", which is centered around a manipulative and ambitious woman who uses her charm to climb the ladder of success in the world of theater. When describing something as an \\"acidic all-male\\" version of \\"All About Eve\\", it likely suggests the same kind of ambition, manipulation, and ruthlessness seen in the original film, but in a male-dominated setting. For some, this reference might be seen as negative, as it implies that the situation in question is full of deceit, betrayal, and self-interest. However, for others, it could be perceived as positive if they appreciate the cleverness and drama present in \\"All About Eve\\" and enjoy seeing similar stories play out in different contexts. 2. \\"a lush, swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain\\": An intermezzo is a short musical composition, usually intended to be played between acts in an opera or play, that helps create a sense of emotion, atmosphere, or contrast. In this context, it seems to refer to a style of storytelling characterized by heightened emotion and dramatic intensity. Describing something as a \\"lush, swooning melodrama\\" implies that the situation is full of emotion, glamour, and theatricality. Again, whether this is considered positive or negative depends on the individual's perspective. Those who enjoy stories filled with passion, romance, and high stakes might view this description positively, appreciating the emotional rollercoaster that comes with melodrama. On the other hand, those who prefer more subdued or realistic narratives may see this as a negative descriptor, signaling an over-the-top or excessively sentimental approach to storytelling. In conclusion, the phrase \\"to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush, swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain\\" can be perceived as both positive and negative, largely depending on the context and the preferences of the person interpreting it. Some may appreciate the drama, ambition, and emotion suggested by the phrase, while others may view it as a depiction of deceit, excessive sentimentality, and unrelatable characters or situations."},{"question":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Who Framed Roger Rabbit Context: In 1947, \\"toons\\" act out theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown, an animated portion of Los Angeles. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again. One day, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor acting performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadgets inventor, Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink &amp; Paint Club, Valiant secretly takes photographs of her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees. The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets Judge Doom, Toontown's Superior Court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic chemical known as \\"The Dip\\". Valiant runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. He then finds Roger hiding in his office, who begs him to help exonerate him. Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar where his ex-girlfriend, Dolores, works. Later, Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon had forced her to pose for the photographs so that he could blackmail Acme. Doom and his toon-weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic toon cab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant tells Roger about Teddy's... Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" Doom, played by Christopher Lloyd, is the main antagonist, and his actions throughout the film lead to a near-death experience. Judge Doom is a sinister figure in Toontown and is known for his cruelty towards toons, especially with his creation of \\"The Dip,\\" a toxic chemical mixture capable of killing a toon. Throughout the movie, Doom is determined to bring Roger Rabbit to justice, as he is the prime suspect in Marvin Acme's murder case. Eventually, Valiant, Roger, and Jessica uncover the truth behind Acme's murder and Doom's hidden connections to the crime. They discover that Doom is also a toon in disguise, as he had been wearing a costume to conceal his true identity as a dangerous criminal mastermind. His ultimate goal in obtaining Toontown and the Acme Corporation was to erase Toontown and replace it with a freeway, a highly profitable venture for him. Doom's near-death experience occurs during the final confrontation between Doom and the protagonists, Eddie Valiant, Roger Rabbit, and Jessica Rabbit. During the climax of the film, Valiant makes use of the Dip that Doom had created as a weapon against him. As the battle ensues, Valiant uses his skills as a detective and his experience with toons, along with some clever distractions and maneuvers, to outwit Doom and his weasel henchmen. Doom eventually meets a gruesome end when he is drenched in his own Dip, which dissolves his toon body and effectively \\"kills\\" his character. This scene can be seen as Doom's near-death experience because his exposure to the Dip, the very weapon he created to wipe out other toons, ultimately leads to his own demise. As a toon character, Doom experiences pain and fear during his final moments, making his near-death experience a poetic end to his character. In conclusion, the main antagonist Doom from \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" almost dies during a confrontation with the movie's heroes, where he is drenched in his own lethal invention, \\"The Dip.\\" This near-death experience serves as a fitting end for the character, as his own weapon turns against him, effectively bringing his dark plans to a halt."},{"question":"Q:What is the missing first step of the following process: - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. A:","response":"A: The missing first step in the given process is filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus. The detailed process of urine formation can be summarized as follows: 1. Filtration: Blood from the renal artery enters the glomerulus, a cluster of capillaries within the Bowman's capsule in the nephron. The blood pressure in the glomerulus forces water, ions, and small molecules out of the capillaries and into the Bowman's capsule. This process is non-selective, and the filtrate includes waste products, glucose, amino acids, and essential electrolytes. 2. Waste enters the kidneys: The filtrates, containing waste materials, move from the Bowman's capsule into the renal tubules, which are responsible for reabsorption and secretion. 3. A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass: As the filtrate passes through the proximal convoluted tubule, more selective reabsorption and secretion occur, allowing the body to maintain proper electrolyte and fluid balance. Essential nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, while wastes and excess ions, like urea and potassium, are secreted into the tubule. 4. Prevents larger molecules to pass: The process prevents larger molecules, such as blood cells and proteins, from passing through the filtration barrier and ensures they remain in the bloodstream. 5. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: As the filtrate continues through the loop of Henle, water and electrolytes are reabsorbed by osmosis and active transport. This allows the body to concentrate the urine by absorbing more water into the bloodstream while retaining the necessary electrolytes. 6. Bad waste is removed: As the filtrate progresses through the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, additional waste products and excess ions are secreted, while some water and electrolytes are reabsorbed to maintain proper balance. 7. The final product is turned into urine: The processed filtrate, now called urine, contains waste products, excess water, and electrolytes. It flows into the renal pelvis and is transported through the ureter and stored in the bladder until it is excreted from the body during urination. Through these steps, the kidneys continuously filter and process the blood, removing waste and maintaining proper fluid and electrolyte balance within the body."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Q: The trade winds are nearest what?

Mariners and sailors have relied on compasses as navigation tools for centuries to accurately steer their vessels and chart their courses across vast and seemingly featureless waters. A compass is a crucial instrument for navigation, as it helps determine a ship's heading by indicating the direction of the Earth's magnetic North Pole relative to its current location. Having a compass on board allows the crew to make necessary adjustments to maintain their course and avoid deviating too far from their intended route. This is especially important when the sky is overcast, or during nighttime when celestial navigation becomes more challenging. In a broader context, other people who might use compasses to reach their destination include: 1. Oceanographers or marine scientists: They often travel by sea to collect data about various aspects of oceanography, such as marine life, coastal processes, and sea floor topography. A compass helps them stay on course in their research and exploration endeavours. 2. Coast Guard or maritime law enforcement personnel: To carry out search and rescue operations or patrolling territorial waters, personnel may rely on compasses to navigate their vessels effectively. 3. Nautical sports enthusiasts: People who participate in sailing competitions, recreational boating, or other water-based activities often use compasses to keep track of their direction when crossing large bodies of water. 4. Naval or military personnel: Compasses play a vital role in naval operations, especially when operating in remote or unfamiliar waters. These tools help them coordinate their movements, carry out strategic planning, and ensure they can successfully reach their intended destinations. 5. Adventure seekers and explorers: Those who embark on expeditions or adventures across vast oceans, usually on smaller vessels or even on kayaks, would use a compass to guide them toward their desired destination. In summary, any person who needs to navigate the ocean or large bodies of water for professional or recreational purposes would likely use a compass to guide their journey and reach their destination safely and accurately."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border. - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991. - The Soviet Occupation Zone (\\"Sovetskaya okkupatsionnaya zona Germanii\\", \\"Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany\\") was the area of central Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on, at the end of World War II.

The GSE claimed to be \\"the first Marxist-Leninist general-purpose encyclopedia\\". - Operation Barbarossa (German: \\"Unternehmen Barbarossa\\") was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which was launched on Sunday 22 June 1941. The operation was driven by an ideological desire to conquer the Western Soviet Union so that it could be repopulated by Germans, to use Slav labour for the war effort, to seize the oil resources in the Caucasus and to seize the grain supply in the Ukraine. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - The Second Polish Republic, also known as the Second Commonwealth of Poland or interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (19181939). Officially known as the Republic of Poland or the Commonwealth of Poland, the Polish state was recreated in 1918, in the aftermath of World War I.

It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west. - Kresy Wschodnie or Kresy (Eastern Borderlands, or Borderlands) was a historical region of the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period constituting nearly half of the territory of the state; where the ethnic Poles, being the largest group, were roughly equal in their number to the size of the national minorities (with notable exceptions). Administratively, the territory of Kresy was composed of voivodeships of Lwów, Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisawów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Woy, and the Biaystok. Today, these territories are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with such major cities as Lviv, Vilnius, and Hrodna no longer in Poland. In the Second Polish Republic the term \\"Kresy\\" roughly equated with the lands beyond the so-called Curzon Line, which was suggested after World War I in December 1919 by the British Foreign Office as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Republic following the century of partitions. In September 1939, after the Soviet Union joined Nazi Germany in their attack on Poland in accordance with the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, the territories were incorporated into Soviet Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania in the atmosphere of terror. - The Potsdam Agreement was the agreement between three of the Allies of World War II, United Kingdom, United States, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for the military occupation and reconstruction of Germanyreferring to the German Reich with its pre-war 1937 borders including the former eastern territoriesand the entire European theatre of War territory.

The activity emerged after the Nazi German Operation Barbarossa during World War II, and according to Great Soviet Encyclopedia it was coordinated and controlled by the Soviet government and modelled on that of the Red Army. The primary objective of the guerrilla warfare waged by the Soviet partisan units was the disruption of the Eastern Front's German rear, especially road and rail communications. There were also regular military formations called partisans, that were used to conduct long-range reconnaissance patrol missions behind Axis lines from the Soviet-held territory. Formation of anti-German Soviet resistance. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of the Second Polish Republic (referred to as the \\"Kresy\\") and annexed the lands totalling with a population of 13,299,000 inhabitants including ethnic Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Czechs and others. - Potsdam is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital Berlin and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel, southwest of Berlin's city center. - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989. - The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe. - Guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants such as paramilitary personnel, armed civilians, or irregulars use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military. - A resistance movement is an organized effort by some portion of the civil population of a country to resist the legally established government or an occupying power and to disrupt civil order and stability. It may seek to achieve its objectives through either the use of nonviolent resistance (sometimes called civil resistance), or the use of force, whether armed or unarmed. In many cases, as for example in Norway in the Second World War, a resistance movement may employ both violent and non-violent methods, usually operating under different organizations and acting in different phases or geographical areas within a country. - The Oder (Czech, Lower Sorbian and , Upper Sorbian: \\"Wódra\\") is a river in Central Europe. It rises in the Czech Republic and flows (generally north- and northwest-ward) through western Poland, later forming of the border between Poland and Germany, part of the OderNeisse line. The river ultimately flows into the Szczecin Lagoon north of Szczecin and then into three branches (the Dziwna, wina and Peene) that empty into the Gulf of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea. - The Socialist Unity Party of Germany, established in April 1946, was the governing MarxistLeninist political party of the German Democratic Republic from the country's foundation in October 1949 until it was dissolved after the Peaceful Revolution in 1989. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991.

She is also the author of the new book “Lead Positive: What Highly Effective Leaders See, Say & Do.” Cramer spoke with Tom Fox, a guest writer for On Leadership and vice president for leadership and innovation at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. Fox also heads up their Center for Government Leadership. Q. What do you consider to be the top skills that create long-term success as a leader in government? A. I think optimism and confidence are two assets that really help a leader go the distance. I also believe the ability to empathize and inspire are key. Lastly, when looking at a leader in a time of crisis, it is important for employees to see a high degree of resilience. This is proof that a leader can be proactive after a big setback. Q. What's the concept of “lead positive”? A. In the book, we’ve identified the chain reaction of see, say and do. The first component, see, is a leader’s ability to grab the spotlight of attention and then focus it on something worthwhile. Strong leaders look for possibilities more often than problems and, as a result, they have the ability to see the upside. The say piece is how leaders start the conversation around an action. And then the do is the ability to take action in order to leverage that upside. When what you see, say and do is aligned to capitalize on the possibilities, you are “leading positive.” Q. Federal leaders are facing intense pressure to deliver results in an uncertain and tight fiscal environment. What techniques can they use to see the positive despite the challenges? A. Leaders should acknowledge the obstacles, but then make it clear that the organization intends to prevail in spite of the challenges. Use your mission and cause to inspire people, and make them invest and support one another with a culture of can-do and sacrifice. People will feel proud of making a sacrifice if the end gain is worth it. You see that especially in the public sector. People in this sector are used to doing more with less, and there’s nothing like a setback to wake you up and make you more creative. I like to call it realistic optimism. When you put what you cannot control out of the picture, what you’re optimistic about is human ingenuity. Q. How can individuals facing tough situations be realistically optimistic? A. Although it may seem difficult, harnessing a setback and using it to propel you forward can be exceptionally rewarding. For instance, I helped the Air Force when they decided to downsize for the first time. Some of their employees had planned for a 20-year career that was now abruptly ending, so I joined forces with Family Support Center to work not only with the enlisted people but also with the families. It takes an amount of adaptation time to figure out what you’re going to create for the rest of your life, but if you’re in a structured process that helps you, chances are that the end result will be very successful. Q. How do you define resilience? A. I see resilience as when you’ve had a big setback, in the form of either a big moment or a small moment, and it causes you to hit the reset button. You’ve been stopped on your way to an important goal, and the goal is blocked and there is no way around it. Resilience is figuring out what new goal, what new aspirations you are going to tap into so that you can keep going. Resilience is also about being analytical and creative simultaneously. You have to analyze and ask yourself, “Is this setback really it?” I tend to think of continuing down the same path as determination. I think of resilience as “I’m really stopped, and I have to figure out a new way.” Q. How can federal leaders more effectively communicate with their employees? A. Leaders do not realize how important they are in driving the change. They have a ripple effect that they often underestimate. People follow people, not just great ideas. Leaders have to put themselves into the equation – you are as important if not more so than any other strategy. People need to look at you, hear from you, and they need to know how much they matter. I like to tell people that substance is critically important. It’s your credibility card. You have to give people details about the substance — the details about how life and this organization will be different. The second element is the sizzle. You need to weave a story that has emotional value to your employees, whether it is an elevator speech or an hour town-hall meeting. The third element, soul, is the why: why you, the leader, care and why they, the audience, should care. It’s the leader’s skin in the game. How to take charge of your career Like On Leadership?

Charles's story is being written down by an unidentified man in a prison cell. On a commuter train, Charles encounters an alluring woman named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston). She is a married financial adviser. The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters and begin to talk. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed manâlater identified as Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel)âbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Charles is blackmailed by LaRoche, who threatens to kill his family if he does not pay 20,000, which Charles promptly pays. A month later, the attacker calls again, this time demanding 100,000.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"The answer is: it is not possible to tell. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The sentence states that \\"A woman wearing a pink shirt jumps in the air with her arms and legs spread to her sides.\\" 2.

A jumping jack is an exercise wherein a person jumps with their feet spread apart while simultaneously raising their arms above their head, and then jumping again to return to a standing position with their feet together and arms at their sides. 4. While the description provided in the sentence does include a jump with arms and legs spread to the sides, it does not explicitly mention the woman returning to a standing position with her feet together and arms at her sides, 5.

However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) for their failure.One year later, the young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, like his father once was, only to learn that they no longer exist. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), the leader of Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. In an attempt to get revenge, D'Artagnan offends Athos, Porthos and Aramis for petty reasons, and schedules duels with each of them, at the same day and at the same place, but in different times, not knowing who they are.Before they can duel, however, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers are attacked by the guards for breaking the law by having a public duel. They fight the soldiers off, at which point D'Artagnan discovers their true identities, but end up being captured and brought before the young King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and his wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). Richelieu attempts to convince them to execute the four prisoners, but they are too impressed, and congratulate them instead, much to Richelieu's anger.Later, Richelieu meets with Milady, who is actually working for him. He orders her to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions and steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace and hide it in the Tower of London with the objective of framing Queen Anne of having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham, who is in France on behalf of the King of England, and who has built a fully armed airship using the designs stolen from the Musketeers.

Can we infer the following? Northern Ireland has several localized government districs Select from the following. (I) Yes (II) It's impossible to say (III) No The answer is:","response":"(I) Yes. The Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 did create twenty-six local government districts to be administered by district councils. This could be viewed as establishing several localized government districts in Northern Ireland. The Act reorganized the way local government was carried out in Northern Ireland, replacing the previous system of local authorities. These new local government districts would each be run by a district council which would have responsibility for a range of local services. These could have included housing, planning, waste management, and cultural or environmental services. This move can be seen as a decentralization of powers, pushing the responsibility for certain services and decisions down to a local level. This development would have had important implications for the governance of Northern Ireland, not only in terms of structures and systems of local administration, but also potentially in terms of the political dynamics within and between various districts. This act was part of a wider program of local government reform in the United Kingdom around this time, which included similar measures being taken in England, Wales, and Scotland. It's important to note that local government in Northern Ireland, as in other parts of the UK, operates within a larger governmental and administrative structure which includes regional and national levels of government, such as the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster. The details of how these local government districts have operated since their creation by this Act in 1972, including their relationship with other levels of government and how these relationships have evolved over time, would be a complex matter that would likely depend on a range of factors, including political, demographic, and economic factors."},{"question":"- profession is executive assistant , professor - successor is brian white - party is new democratic party - riding is dauphin - predecessor is gordon ritchie - spouse is lois -lrb- reimer -rrb- lewycky - term end is 1984 - birth date is 12 february 1946 - term start is 1980 - birth place is dauphin , manitoba -rrb- Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.

She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight.

When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down. In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs in the large house and retreats to her room. Mrs. Thomas, who brings her some food, says she did not pass anyone.

To simplify, we add together the numbers on the right side: -132 + 167 = 35 So, our equation now becomes -5*n = 35. Step 2: Solve for n Now, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. The mathematical reason for this is that it is the inverse operation of multiplication. Doing this will isolate the variable n to one side of the equation, which allows us to determine its value. Our equation becomes: -5*n / -5 = 35 / -5 Both -5's on the left side will cancel out, so n = 35 / -5. This further simplifies to n = -7. Hence, the solution to the equation -5*n = -132 + 167 is n = -7."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Two months before Stambolic's disappearance, Draskovic survived an attempt on his life in the Montenegrin sea resort of Budva.

Delirious, he stumbles across the North African desert into the Empress of Britain, a small, isolated hotel owned by Farid (Akim Tamiroff). The staff consists of just Frenchwoman Mouche (Anne Baxter), as the cook has fled and the waiter Davos was killed the night before by German bombing. Before Farid and Mouche can decide what to do with the newcomer, the swiftly advancing Germans take over the hotel to use as headquarters for Field Marshal Rommel (Erich von Stroheim) and his staff. Bramble assumes the identity of Davos to save himself. When Rommel summons him to a private chat, Bramble is stunned to discover that Davos was a valued German spy, but manages to play along. He learns that he is to be sent to Cairo next. Later, he steals a pistol from genial, music-loving Italian General Sebastiano (Fortunio Bonanova), planning to serve the field marshal a bullet rather than coffee the next morning. Not wanting trouble, Mouche steals the pistol and waits on Rommel herself. When some captured British officers are brought to the hotel for a luncheon with Rommel, one of them (a past guest) realizes that Davos has been replaced. Bramble privately explains who he is and what he plans to do. The officer orders him to use his position of trust to instead gather military intelligence. At the luncheon, Rommel teases his guests, allowing them to ask him twenty questions about his future plans. Bramble listens with interest. From the conversation and later remarks by Rommel, he eventually deduces that the field marshal, disguised as an archeologist before the war, had secretly prepared five hidden supply dumps, the \\"Five Graves to Cairo\\", for the conquest of Egypt. The final piece of the puzzle (their locations) falls into place when Bramble realizes that Rommel's cryptic references to points Y, P, and T refer to the letters of the word \\"Egypt\\" printed on his map.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","response":"First Question: Why are people so obsessed with GoPro cameras? People are obsessed with GoPro cameras for several reasons. GoPro cameras have revolutionized the way people capture their experiences, especially when it comes to adventure and outdoor activities. Here are a few reasons why people are so obsessed with them: 1. Portability: GoPro cameras are small, lightweight, and easy to carry around, making them an ideal choice for travelers and adventure seekers. Because of their compact size, users can mount them on their helmets, bikes, surfboards, and more. 2. Durability: GoPro cameras are built to withstand harsh conditions and elements. They are waterproof and are designed to survive falls, which makes them perfect for capturing footage while participating in extreme sports or exploring the great outdoors. 3. High-quality videos and images: GoPro cameras offer high-resolution videos and images, with the ability to shoot in various modes such as slow-motion, time-lapse, and burst. This feature allows users to capture every detail of their experiences and create professional-quality content. 4. Wide-angle lens: The GoPro camera's wide-angle lens allows users to capture more of their environment in a single shot. This is particularly useful for filming action sports and scenic landscapes, as it captures the full scope of the scene. 5. User-friendly interface: GoPro cameras are easy to use, even for beginners. The menu is intuitive, and users can easily switch between modes and settings, allowing them to focus on the action without being distracted by complicated controls. 6. Accessories and mounts: GoPro offers a wide range of accessories and mounts, which allows people to customize their camera to suit their specific needs. From waterproof cases to chest harnesses, there are options available for almost any activity. 7. Community: GoPro has a strong and supportive community of users who share content, discuss camera techniques, and inspire one another. This fosters a sense of camaraderie and belonging among its users, increasing their passion for the brand. Second Question: What is a GoPro camera? A GoPro camera is a compact, wearable, and mountable action camera originally designed for capturing high-quality images and videos during extreme sports and outdoor activities. Introduced in 2004 by company founder Nick Woodman, GoPro cameras have now become popular among enthusiasts in various fields, ranging from sports to filmmaking. GoPro cameras are known for their small size, durability, and versatility, allowing users to capture footage from unique perspectives that would be difficult to achieve with larger, more conventional cameras. Many GoPro models are also waterproof, dustproof, and shock-resistant, making them reliable companions for people who want to document their adventures in all types of environments. The cameras are equipped with a variety of shooting modes, such as time-lapse, slow motion, and burst mode. This, combined with their high-resolution image and video capabilities, makes GoPro cameras an attractive choice for capturing and sharing life's most exciting moments. In summary, these two questions are related but not the same. The first question asks why people are obsessed with GoPro cameras, whereas the second question inquires about what a GoPro camera is. Understanding the features and advantages of GoPro cameras can help explain why people are so passionate about using them."},{"question":"In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

His mother played piano in a church, the musical style of which would remain an influence; in addition, he learned to play several genres of music during his youth in Cape Town, including marabi, mbaqanga, and American jazz. He became well known in jazz circles in Cape Town and Johannesburg. In 1959 and 1960, Ibrahim played with the Jazz Epistles group in Sophiatown, alongside saxophonist Kippie Moeketsi, trumpeter Hugh Masekela, trombonist Jonas Gwangwa (who were all in the orchestra of the musical King Kong that opened in Johannesburg in February 1959), bassist Johnny Gertze and drummer Makaya Ntshoko; in January 1960, the six musicians went into the Gallo studio and recorded the first full-length jazz LP by Black South African musicians, Jazz Epistle Verse One, with 500 copies being produced. Although the group avoided explicitly political activity, the apartheid government was suspicious of it and other jazz groups, and targeted them heavily during the increase in state repression following the Sharpeville massacre, and eventually, the Jazz Epistles broke up. Passage 3:Romano was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent in 1954. In , while playing for the Waterloo White Hawks, Romano hit 9 home runs in nine consecutive games.

He is not necessarily talking about where he pitches the off-breaks that made him a valuable contributor in last summer’s T20, or the weight of his new bat. The 32-year-old is just as likely to be explaining his analysis of an afternoon’s runners. A new three-year deal has just been signed with his county but Smith is planning for a longer-term future which he hopes will be played out on a different form of turf. Hampshire cricket all-rounder Will Smith says he has been hooked on racing since he was five-years-old. Smith said he would like to go into racing punditry when he finishes playing cricket in six or seven years time. Racing fan Smith (left) talks to Sportsmail's Marcus Townend (right) at Kempton. 1 VAUTOUR: Quite simply, wins the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival by 10 lengths! 2 FAUGHEEN: Wins the Champion Hurdle by five lengths! 3 BRIAR HILL: Fell in last season’s Albert Bartlett Hurdle but had previously beaten first and third Very Wood and Apache Jack at Naas, giving them weight. 4 CAPOTE: Soft ground staying chaser who should prove better than his hurdling form. 5 ELENIKA: Very well handicapped for steeplechasing and goes well fresh. 6 CHAMPAGNE AT TARA: Will prove better upped in trip and nicely handicapped. 7 OUR JOEY: Highly rated by Cumbrian trainer George Bewley.

Runs in Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton this afternoon. 10 SHUTTHEFRONTDOOR: Looks suited to the Grand National. On Wednesday he was the studio expert for subscription channel Racing UK, interpreting the action from Nottingham and Warwick. During the winter months, Smith can also be found offering useful advice to punters via William Hill radio. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs, won four County Championship medals (three with Durham and one with Nottinghamshire) and was a member of the Hampshire team which won this year’s Division Two to gain promotion. But he has an equal passion for horseracing. He said: ‘My father used to take me and my older brother to Towcester every Boxing Day and Easter Monday. I loved everything about a racecourse, the atmosphere, the smells. I was five or six and it got me hooked. ‘Throughout my teenage years I always studied the form in the hope of making a pound or two. I have always had an analytical mind so I enjoyed that side of it. ‘Two winters ago, I was coming into the last year of my contract with Durham. It was up in the air whether I would get another deal because of their financial troubles. ‘I thought I might have to do something else so I thought “what do I have a passion for?”’ The cricketer, who captained Durham as they retained their title in the 2009 season, said: ‘I pestered the (RUK) producer with emails and didn’t let him have a moment’s peace because I was so keen. I love doing the punditry. It is ideally where I would like to be once the cricket finishes even if, hopefully, that is another six or seven years down the line.’ Smith revealed that in 2009 he was unsure whether he would get a new Durham contract so was f. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs and has won four County Championship medals. Smith captained current England skipper Alastair Cook when the two were at Bedford School together. Smith, who took three for 15 when a losing semi-finalist in the T20 finals in August, has a cricket pedigree as rich as some of the racehorses he analyses. His fielding skills earned him a stint as a substitute fielder for England while on the Notts staff and, prior to playing for British Universities, he captained current England skipper Alastair Cook while they were contemporaries at Bedford School. Smith said: ‘He was 4ft 2in and I don’t think his voice had broken but you could tell he had a bit of talent. I was No 3 and Alastair opened with James Stedman, who went on to play hockey for England. ‘They put on numerous double hundred partnerships so I spent a lot of my time with my pads on not doing a lot.’ Smith, married to Catherine with two daughters, Ava, three, and Daisy, six months, believes his interest in racing acts as a useful diversion from the demands of the county circuit. He said: ‘If you are just watching the cricket you become a little too intense about it, or I do anyway. Also at night time you just want to switch off. ‘I go out for a meal with team-mates and then can sit back and watch the racing I have missed and catch up on the form.’ Another result at Hampshire suggests Smith has not given his team-mates too many losing tips — he was voted Players’ Player of the Year for 2014.

The white corner is the end of the diagonal line referred to above. Slip it into the nearest blue pocket. This will create a half cube, formed by three squares which all border each other. Each side should also be half its original color and half the color of the piece that got tucked into it. The figure will now be 3D, so that it can no longer sit flat on the table. When you position the cube with one side on the table, the leftover corners should form diagonal halves of the last three sides of the cube. From this position, you can easily add the next side. Make sure it's lined up the right way. The top triangle will line up perfectly with the triangle from the earlier piece of the same color so that those two triangles together will form a square on one of the other sides left to be filled. The other triangle, the bottom one of the piece you're putting in, should tuck into a fold on a side already in place. Here, slide the white corner into the blue pocket to attach the blue piece. Where possible, tuck loose corners into the corresponding pockets on the sides they should attach to. Again, make sure the piece is lined up such that its triangular corners can slip into the pockets on the sides they should attach to. Tuck loose corners into their corresponding pockets. At this point, you should have two loose flaps on the only side left to add; everything else should be tucked in. Again, line it up such that the loose flaps will fit into the pockets of the piece. This will firmly attach the last side of the cube.","response":"The article provides detailed step-by-step instructions on assembling a complex 3D puzzle, specifically a cube composed of interlocking multicolored pieces."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"One of the buses is marked \\"\\"linea express\\"\\" while the other is marked \\"\\"metropolitan transit system\\"\\". .\\" can we conclude that \\"The buses are fast.\\"?

E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why is the FDA concerned about the e-cigarettes?\\" is \\"Dangerous\\"?","response":"Yes, that's right! The FDA is concerned about e-cigarettes because they found out that they have dangerous chemicals in them. They did some tests and found out that some e-cigarettes have stuff that's not safe for people, like a chemical from antifreeze and other things that can make you sick if you smoke them. They also don't know how much nicotine, the addictive part, is inside these e-cigarettes. So, the FDA wants to make sure people know that e-cigarettes might not be safe, even though the companies making them say they are a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke."},{"question":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), shipBeam, 24.4; ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), status, \\"Sold to Argentina 15 October 1968\\"; ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), length, 192000.0 (millimetres); ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2), country, Argentina.

To do this, we can add 313*d to both sides of the equation to eliminate -313*d from the right side: -314*d + 313*d - 1 = -313*d + 313*d This simplifies to: -1*d - 1 = 0 Step 2: Isolate d further by isolating the term with the variable. Now, add 1 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -1: -1*d - 1 + 1 = 0 + 1 This simplifies to: -1*d = 1 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d (-1) to solve for d: [-1*d] / (-1) = 1 / (-1) This simplifies to: d = -1 So, the solution to the equation -314*d - 1 = -313*d is d = -1."},{"question":"Test for natural language inference.

He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder. Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (\\"Persian Songs\\", 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (\\"The Red Ash Tree\\", 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: \\"you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable.\\" Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including \\"Le lever du soleil sur le Nil\\" (\\"Sunrise over the Nile\\", 1898) and \\"Hymne à la paix\\" (\\"Hymn to Peace\\", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein. He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, \\"One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence, of oratorio.\\" He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra. In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach... contains an answer for the question: What were the names of the two songs Saint-Saëns wrote during his career?, what is it ?

The incident has sparked debates on media platforms as to the severity of penalties for overdue library materials. Cathy and Melvin Duren, hailing from Tecumseh, a small rural city in Lenawee County, Michigan, have been thrust into the national spotlight. The situation began when they failed to return two library books on time. Their overdue story is more than just a common tale of forgotten due dates; it serves as a cautionary tale highlighting the gravity of local laws and regulations. The Durens borrowed two books from their local Tecumseh Public Library, titles including \\"The Rome Prophecy\\" and \\"A Reliable Wife.\\" However, amid the chaos of daily life, the couple inadvertently failed to return the books within the stipulated timeframe. The overdue library books quickly escalated into a county-wide issue, resulting in misdemeanor charges that were pushed forward by the Lenawee County Economic Crimes Unit. Upon discovery of the oversight, the library initially employed their standard protocol for recovering overdue materials. They sent out multiple notifications via mail to remind the Durens of their outstanding books. However, after several months without a resolution, the Economic Crimes Unit was involved to help recover the outstanding fines and the books themselves. The Durens, surprised at the severity of the turning situation, did return \\"The Rome Prophecy\\" albeit late, along with a partial payment of the monetary fine. However, the second book, \\"A Reliable Wife\\", had been lost and thus could not be returned. The couple were willing to plead guilty, but the matter did not end there. Given the high replacement cost of the lost book and outstanding overdue fees, the situation quickly escalated, culminating with the Durens facing a potential misdemeanor charge each. To add weight to the severity of the situation, the charges carried a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail and a 500 fine. The Duren's predicament signals the gravity of maintaining public property and honoring borrowing systems. While their story may appear extreme, it serves as a stark reminder of the legal repercussions tied to something as trivial as unreturned and overdue library materials. Certainly, critics argue that jail time for unreturned library books does seem excessive, but proponents advocate that punishment of such kind serves as a deterring factor for potential offenders. They argue that it underscores the importance of property rights and helps maintain a sense of order, particularly in public services such as libraries. On the side, it also raises the question of whether the government resources spent on tracking and punishing such \\"crimes\\" might be better employed elsewhere. As the case still awaits a final verdict, there is no denying that its ripple effects are already being felt across the nation. The media attention surrounding the incident underlines the indisputable necessity of a balanced approach to penalties for overdue public properties. Factors such as the duration of the late return, the integrity of intent, financial conditions of the borrower, and the general seriousness of the situation should all be taken into consideration. This incident, although unfortunate, spotlights the ongoing debate over the best strategies to ensure the safe, respectful, and timely return of public resources invested in libraries: funds, valuable books, and a system that caters to the broad community. The narrative of the Durens thus evolves from a cautionary tale into a broader discourse about public property and libraries' place in our society."},{"question":"Is Snow White an example of good consent? Chain of thought:","response":"Snow White, a classic fairy tale that dates back to the early 19th century, is not an ideal example of good consent, especially in today's conversations surrounding consent and personal boundaries. In the story, while Snow White is asleep (due to the poisoned apple given by the evil queen), a prince discovers her and kisses her without any signs of consent. Additionally, when she is unconscious, the seven dwarfs take care of her; again, she is not in a position to provide consent to any decisions that the seven dwarfs make on her behalf. The story perpetuates outdated beliefs and reinforces passive roles of women and their dependency on men. Late-modern adaptations and retellings of this story have taken steps to challenge these themes and promote more equitable character dynamics that emphasize the importance of consent and autonomy."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Merzbox is a box set compilation by the Japanese noise musician Merzbow .

The European Club Association, an umbrella organisation representing the interests of 214 teams from the continent, is a powerful voice in the ongoing negotiations around when the tournament will be scheduled. And the group, which counts 10 English clubs among its number, is reported to favour May, a stance it will be able to present to the sport’s world governing body FIFA at a calendar task force meeting next month. Sepp Blatter (centre) suggested a winter World Cup in Qatar, which is unpopular with leading clubs in Europe. A traditional mid-summer competition appears to have few supporters, with heat and humidity in the Middle East state reaching levels that could compromise the safety of players and spectators. Bringing the event forward to January or February has its supporters but a clash with the Winter Olympics presents a potentially insurmountable obstacle. Another alternative, apparently favoured by FIFA president Sepp Blatter, would see the World Cup take place in November and December, when the climate would be more suited to football. But that would represent a huge disruption to many domestic leagues, a prospect that could wreak havoc with European structures - effectively splitting the 2022-23 campaign in two as well as having a knock-on effect to future seasons. Now it seems ECA, formed in 2008 and backed by the power of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St Germain as well as the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and both Manchester clubs, will push for its own vision.

This thing is useless. Actually, I forgot and left the towels on overnight. Well, they weren't dry (and they weren't soaking wet to begin with either). So, I decided to give it another try. I put the dry towels on and left them (overnight) -- I am not exaggerating, they were NOT warm. This product is not hotel quality. Don't waste your money. They don't work. Seriously.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population.

Possible A: dead, construction site, under ground, egypt, cemetary Why is \\"cemetary\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","response":"\\"Cemetery\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it relates to the scenario presented in the question. The question pertains to a murder case being reopened, which implies that there could be a dead body involved. In many criminal investigations, particularly those involving murder or suspicious deaths, exhumations (digging up bodies) can be a crucial step in gathering evidence or finding the truth. Cemeteries are locations where dead bodies are commonly buried, making them a logical place for an excavation to begin in a reopened murder case. This is why, among the provided options, \\"cemetery\\" stands out as the most closely related to the context of the question, and it aligns with human common sense.

The audience is provided with an insight into the world of the opening section's primary characters while concurrently observing the public re-emergence of a psychic, Simon Silver (Robert De Niro). The ending of the film's first half is signified by the sudden death of Matheson from a chronic vascular condition at the same time that one of Silver's comeback performances takes place; an incident that is particularly significant due to the death of a former nemesis of Silver, a skeptic who investigated the psychic's work, under similar circumstances. Matheson also had a previous encounter with Silver. She recounted a public meeting when Silver had, for an instant, got the best of her by bringing up the subject of her son's spirit (her son was in a vegetative coma and on life support). Matheson agrees only to appear on a televised panel in anticipation of Silver's return. Prior to her death, Matheson refuses to co-operate with Buckley's insistent call to undertake another investigation of Silver, warning Buckley against such an undertaking due to her previous experience with the psychic. However, following Matheson's death, the assistant becomes increasingly obsessed with investigating Silver for the purpose of exposing the popular psychic as a fraud. During Buckley's efforts to reveal Silver's large-scale trickery, a series of inexplicable events occurs â electronic devices explode, dead birds appear, and Buckley's laboratory is vandalised. Buckley's paranoia intensifies, as he believes Silver is behind these incidents.

Answer:","response":"Based on the background article and the new situation presented, Thomas is less likely to be experiencing mild allergy symptoms. In the given scenario, Jonathan experiences itchy, watery eyes and sneezing when he goes outside during springtime when pollen is abundant. These symptoms are typical of mild allergic reactions, which often include reactions to pollen, also known as hay fever or seasonal allergies. On the other hand, Thomas experienced a reaction after eating shellfish at a seafood dinner. Thomas's symptoms include a feeling of throat closing up and difficulty breathing. These symptoms are indicative of a more severe allergic reaction, potentially anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening condition. Severe symptoms like these require immediate medical attention, possibly involving an injection of epinephrine.

Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good.

They occur from South Asia through Southeast Asia to Australia. At present, there is no consensus as to the preferred classification of this group; some sources treat Phylliidae as a much larger taxon, containing the members of what are presently considered to be several different families. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. - The Phasmatodea (also known as Phasmida or Phasmatoptera) are an order of insects, whose members are variously known as stick insects (in Europe and Australasia), stick-bugs or walking sticks (in the United States and Canada), phasmids, ghost insects and leaf insects (generally the family Phylliidae). The group's name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"phasma\\", meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Their natural camouflage makes them difficult for predators to detect, but many species have a secondary line of defence in the form of startle displays, spines or toxic secretions.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Silicon Valley\\" correctly answer the question \\"In 1998, which state became the first to ban smoking in work places?\\"?","response":"No, the response \\"Silicon Valley\\" does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer is California, as mentioned in the paragraph that California was the first state to ban smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants in 1998.

With the May 2004 resignation of chairman Barbara Cassani, Coe became the chairman for the latter phase of the bid. As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt he was better suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure the IOC's backing. Coe's presentation at the critical IOC meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won the IOC's blessing on 6 July. In September 2008 Coe controversially told reporters \\"Fuck 'em\\" when asked about the opposition to the creation of a footballing Team GB from Scottish and Welsh supporters as reported in The London Paper. Coe attended the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver to see how the city coped with the challenges of hosting. Lord Coe noted the Games had \\"gradually recovered from its tumultuous start\\" and queried that he \\"never thought the British would find rivals in their preoccupation with the weather which is almost elevated to an Olympic event\\" as he credited VANOC for meeting unforeseen challenges such as the unseasonably warm weather of Cypress Mountain. Coe added \\"Rarely have I seen a host city so passionate and so ready to embrace the Games\\". Coe was instrumental in asking Queen Elizabeth II to star in Happy and Glorious a short film featuring James Bond which formed part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The director of the ceremony, Danny Boyle first pitched the idea to Coe, who loved it so much that he took it to Edward Young, Deputy Private Secretary to the Queen. A friend of Coe's from their days of advising William Hague, Young \\"listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the Boss\\". Word soon came back to Coe that she would love to take part.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the warning amounted to \\"a very clear message\\" of the dangers of Brexit. Vote Leave campaigners have strongly criticised Mr Carney, with one calling for him to resign. However, a spokesman for Mr Carney rejected the call, saying the Bank had \\"a duty\\" to make its judgements known. The latest minutes from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said that a leave vote may cause both growth and sterling to fall and unemployment to rise. Mr Carney said the Bank had not compiled formal forecasts about the possibility of a recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - resulting from a Brexit vote. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK now had a \\"clear and unequivocal warning\\" from the MPC as well as the Governor of the Bank of England about the risks of a Leave vote, \\"The Bank is saying that it would face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on one hand and stabilising output and employment on the other,\\" he said. How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership. \\"So either families would face lower incomes because inflation would be higher, or the economy would be weaker with a hit to jobs and livelihoods. This is a lose-lose situation for Britain. Either way, we'd be poorer.\\" Jacob Rees Mogg, a Tory MP and Treasury Select Committee member, called on Mr Carney to resign. \\"I think it is unprecedented for the governor of a central bank to suggest that people should short his own currency. Suggesting sterling will fall sharply is simply not what responsible central bankers do,\\" he said. Former Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith said that Mr Carney needed to be \\"very careful\\" about making such comments. Lord Lamont, the former Chancellor and Vote Leave spokesman, said: \\"The governor should be careful that he doesn't cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the governor's and the governor's alone. A prudent governor would simply have said that 'we are prepared for all eventualities'.\\" In response, a spokesman for Mr Carney said: \\"The Bank of England has not made, and will not make, any overall assessment of the economics of UK's membership of the European Union. \\"At the same time, the Bank must assess the implications of the UK's EU membership for our ability to achieve our core objectives and we have a duty to report our evidence-based judgments to Parliament and to the public. That is the fundamental standard of an open and transparent central bank. \\"Assessing and reporting major risks does not mean becoming involved in politics; rather it would be political to suppress important judgments which relate directly to the Bank's remits and which influence our policy actions.\\" The Bank's latest quarterly Inflation Report, released on Thursday, predicted that economic growth would slow in the second quarter of the year, but pick up in the second half. It also cut the growth outlook for the next three years. The report also forecast that inflation would reach 0.9% in September if long as the UK stayed in the EU. The MPC unanimously voted to keep interest rates at 0.5%. In the Bank of England's assessment of the health of the UK economy, one ringing sentence jumps out: \\"The most significant risks to the [economic] forecast concern the referendum,\\" the Monetary Policy Committee says. It goes on to reveal that far from this simply being a judgement on what Bank officials describe as the \\"uncertainty spike\\" around the fact the referendum is taking place at all - this is a judgement that Brexit would have a material effect on the economy. In a Bank world of carefully chosen words, \\"material\\" means significant. And significantly downwards. Read more from Kamal here. The Inflation Report said that uncertainty over the EU referendum was already weighing on economic activity: \\"There is evidence that a material proportion of the 9% fall in sterling exchange rate since its peak in November could reflect referendum effects. \\"It is hard to judge how much of the slowdown reflects a loss of underlying momentum and so may persist and how much is likely to unwind if uncertainty recedes following the referendum. Referendum effects will also make it harder to interpret economic indicators over the next few months.\\" Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital Markets, said: \\"The clear message of the Bank of England is that they are in no hurry to do anything until they assess the impact of the outcome of the referendum on the economy.\\" However, the inflation report noted that in the event of a leave vote, the MPC would face the difficult choice of raising rates to control inflation or lowering them to stimulate the economy. The Report said that inflation probably fell back to 0.3% in April from 0.5% in March, reflecting the falls in oil and food prices over the last year and the strength of sterling in the same period. It expected inflation to return to the target 2% level by mid-2018 as these factors faded out.

The first sentence conveys a more concrete and clear picture, while the second suggests a more open and detailed expression. 2. Regarding the sense of desire and fulfillment, \\"explicit\\" in sentence (1) implies a clear and obvious presentation, while \\"tangible\\" in sentence (2) means it can be felt or touched - more real. These two adjectives convey different meanings, with the first sentence indicating the clarity of desire and fulfillment, and the second hinting at experiencing it in a more physical way. Looking at these observations, the answer is: + no"},{"question":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning? The beta - acute dose effects of dependent radiation on the skin are as follows : The acute dose-dependent effects of beta radiation on skin are as follows : OPT: -- no; -- yes; The answer is:","response":"To determine if these two sentences have the same meaning, let's break them down step by step and analyze each component: 1. Compare the key phrases: a. \\"beta - acute dose effects of dependent radiation\\" b. \\"acute dose-dependent effects of beta radiation\\" 2. Analyze the structure and meaning of each phrase: a. In the first phrase (a), \\"beta\\" and \\"acute dose\\" are adjectives modifying \\"effects.\\" \\"Dependent radiation\\" likely refers to \\"radiation that is dependent on something.\\" However, this phrase is somewhat unclear and could be misinterpreted. b. In the second phrase (b), \\"acute dose-dependent\\" is the adjective modifying \\"effects.\\" This clearly indicates that the effects are caused by an acute (short-term or sudden) dose of radiation and that they are dependent on the dose. \\"Beta radiation\\" specifies the type of radiation causing the effects. 3. Compare the clarity and coherence of each phrase: a. The first phrase (a) is somewhat ambiguous because it is not clear which term \\"dependent\\" is modifying. b. The second phrase (b) is much clearer, as the the term \\"dose-dependent\\" is clearly modifying \\"effects\\" and the overall structure is more coherent. Based on this step-by-step analysis, I can conclude that the two sentences do not have the exact same meaning. The second sentence is clearer and more cohesive in describing the relationship between the acute dose and the effects of beta radiation on the skin. The answer is: -- no;"},{"question":"Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Steelers, the Bengals flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 9 intraconference duel with the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Bills QB J. P. Losman completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans. Fortunately, the Bengals answered with QB Carson Palmer completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh. In the second quarter, Buffalo retook the lead with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 23-yard field goal. Immediately afterwards, Cincinnati would take the lead as WR/KR Glenn Holt returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. The Bills ended the half with Lindell getting a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Buffalo regained the lead with Lindell kicking a 29-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Bengals went back into the lead with Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jeremi Johnson. Unfortunately, Cincinnati's struggles continued with Lindell nailing a 38-yard field goal, along with RB Marshawn Lynch completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal & getting a 56-yard TD run.

Movie title: Tinker Bell Context: Tinker Bell (Mae Whitman) is born from the first laugh of a baby, and is brought by the winds to Pixie Hollow (which is part of the island of Never Land). She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer. When Tinker Bell returns, she tries to explain, but Mary simply responds that she knows, and expresses her disappointment with Tinker Bell's actions. On the beach, Tinker Bell finds parts of a music box and figures out how to put them together. Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, and Rosetta witness her doing this, then tell her that she was tinkering and that she should be proud of her talentâif this is what she's good at, the mainland should not matter.

Choices: - stomach - brain - skin - heart A: A:","response":"Regularly done aerobic activities can help build up endurance and make the heart stronger. Aerobic activities, also known as cardiovascular or endurance exercises, involve the continuous movement of large muscle groups in the body. These exercises cause the heart to pump faster and stronger in order to deliver the necessary oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and organs. Some examples of aerobic activities include walking, running, swimming, cycling, and dancing. Performing regular aerobic activities offers numerous benefits to the heart and the entire cardiovascular system. Here is a detailed look at the different ways in which aerobic exercises make the heart stronger: 1. Improved heart efficiency: Aerobic exercise strengthens the heart muscle, enabling it to pump a higher volume of blood with each beat. This means that the heart can supply more oxygen and nutrients to various organs in the body with fewer beats, reducing the workload on the heart and making it more efficient. 2. Lower resting heart rate: With regular aerobic exercise, the resting heart rate decreases. A lower resting heart rate is a sign of a healthy and efficiently functioning heart. 3. Enhanced vascular function: Aerobic activities improve the flexibility and elasticity of blood vessels, allowing them to expand and contract more effectively. This results in a lower risk of developing plaque buildup, which can lead to blocked arteries and heart disease. 4. Improved blood circulation: The increased blood flow due to aerobic exercises leads to better circulation and delivery of nutrients and oxygen to various parts of the body. Improved circulation helps maintain the overall health of the cardiovascular system. 5. Reduced blood pressure: Regularly performing aerobic exercises can help lower high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. 6. Increased HDL cholesterol: Aerobic activities can boost the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \\"good\\" cholesterol. HDL cholesterol transports excess cholesterol from the blood back to the liver for elimination, lowering the risk of plaque buildup and heart-related problems. 7. Weight management: Aerobic exercises can help with weight management by burning calories and reducing body fat. Maintaining a healthy weight reduces the strain on the heart and lowers the risk of heart disease. 8. Better regulation of blood sugar: Aerobic exercise enhances the body's ability to utilize insulin and regulate blood sugar levels. This can help prevent or control diabetes, a condition known to raise the risk of heart disease. 9. Reduced stress and inflammation: Regular aerobic exercise helps reduce stress levels, which can have a detrimental effect on heart health if it becomes chronic. Additionally, it can lower inflammation in the body, which is another contributing factor to heart disease. It is important to consult a healthcare professional or certified trainer before starting any aerobic exercise program, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or who are new to exercise. They can guide you on the appropriate intensity, frequency, and duration of aerobic activities to ensure that you gain the most benefits for your heart while also minimizing the risk of injury."},{"question":"Parishin mietintö onneksi palauttaa tasapainon, koska siinä ei tueta mitään sellaista, joka heikentää teollisuutemme kilpailukykyä tai joka tarjoaa yrityksille kannustimia sijoittua uudelleen.

Select from the following. + Yes; + No; Answer:","response":"No; The mentioned information seems to be somewhat incorrect or misleading. Fungi spores cannot develop into bacteria, as they are entirely different types of organisms, each belonging to entirely different kingdom in the biological classification system. Fungi spores develop into a new fungus organism, given the right conditions. Fungal spores are reproductive structures produced by fungi, quite analogous in functionality to seeds produced by plants. Given adequate condition of temperature, availability of nutrients, and moisture, the spores can form a mycelium, which is the main body of the fungus. Mycelium, a mass of threadlike hyphae, is often unseen as it is located within the substrate, whereas the fungus's fruiting body (such as mushroom caps) are what we see outside. The process of spore formation and germination into a mycelium doesn't typically require fertilization in most fungi. Fertilization in the context of fungi often involves the fusion of two haploid hyphae (from two different mating types) to form a dikaryotic mycelium, which eventually can give rise to fruiting bodies. Some fungi reproduce only sexually (like morels), while others can also reproduce asexually through their spores (like yeasts). In the case of the answer \\"litter,\\" it is unclear as this term does not usually relate to fungi or their reproductive processes in a way that fits the context of your question. In an ecological context, \\"litter\\" often refers to the dead plant material lying on the ground (like fallen leaves), which certain types of fungi can decompose as saprophytes. However, the spores of these fungi develop into new fungi, not into the litter itself or bacteria. Therefore, the accurate answer to the question \\"What can fungi spores develop into without being fertilized?\\" should be \\"new fungi organisms\\" or \\"mycelium.\\" It's essential to note that the specific type of fungus will determine its reproduction and development methods. Some fungi produce spores both sexually and asexually, depending on circumstances such as a change in nutrient availability or temperature."},{"question":"8:15but when pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the lord had said.

In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary. Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts.

Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved.

Some apartments have extra storage space that you can rent, or you may need to consider renting a storage facility.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. social dynamics cause frustration in the organization when - The gap widens between ground folks and senior leadership - the founder lack skills to take their vision to actionable work - the employee followers lack structure - not enough information A:","response":"Social dynamics can cause frustration in an organization when: 1. The gap between ground-level employees and senior leadership widens: As a company grows, it's common for a disconnect to emerge between the top management and the employees working on the frontlines. This gap can result in distrust, miscommunication, and a lack of understanding of each other's perspectives. 2. Founders or leaders lack the skills to turn their vision into actionable work: Visionary leaders may have great ideas, but if they are unable to effectively communicate or implement those ideas, it can cause frustration among team members. Employees may struggle to understand the direction or goals of the organization, resulting in confusion and decreased motivation. 3. Employee followers lack structure: While some employees thrive in open-ended environments, many require structure and guidance in order to be most effective in their roles. When there is inadequate structure provided by management, employees can feel lost, disorganized, and overwhelmed, leading to frustration. 4. Inadequate information sharing: Communication is key in any organization. When information is not shared effectively or is withheld, either intentionally or unintentionally, it can create tension and misunderstandings among team members. This lack of transparency can lead to distrust and frustration, as employees may feel excluded or left in the dark about important decisions or processes. To mitigate these issues, organizations should prioritize open communication, encourage collaboration, provide structure and support when needed, and promote an inclusive environment where all employees feel valued and heard. By addressing these social dynamics, organizations can enhance employee satisfaction, performance, and overall success."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Ross Dawson started a business.

He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence. The fiscal crisis persisted.

(so he tells me; i can't vouch for it since i was out of it). i wake up to a dr thumping my chest saying 'ok we got her back, there she is'. DAMN! turns out they gave me a combination of meds that caused my BP to drop so low that i damn near died. if my husband hadn't been there i would have died since NO ONE responded to the call button. then they decide gee guess we better keep her overnight just in case. meanwhile, my pain is still there. it feels like a steel band is around my chest. the admitting dr is someone else entirely and again i have to give my medical history. do these people not talk to each other? so i go from there to the observation unit were the nurses were terrific. couldn't ask for better care--charity, denise, jan, ect they were all wonderful. i had a ct scan, an ultrasound, cardio enyzemes, and no sleep. i finally get to check out @ 12 on 6/14. today i get the bill for it. i was there for about 12 hours, they damn near killed me, i had 1 xray, 1 ct, 1ultrasound, various blood draws, 3 morphine shots and 3 blood draws. oh and lets not forget the wonderful breakfast. all this comes to a total of ..........(drum roll please) 16,300.00. and they have no idea what was causing the chest pain and recommend.............. further testing. next time maybe i will try john c lincoln.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

UPDATED:. 07:18 EST, 1 February 2013. Parents should avoid leaving children under five unsupervised in front of the TV, the creator of Jackanory and Play School warned today. Joy Whitby, 82, who launched the BBC shows in the Sixties before working at ITV, is worried about ‘the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six’. The Oxford history graduate, who gained a job on Play School after writing about how the Watch With Mother slot could be refreshed, said she was saddened by today’s ‘noisy, meretricious cartoons’. Concerns: Joy Whitby (pictured second left at a London Weekend board meeting in 1969), now aged 82, is worried about 'the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six' ‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ Ms Whitby told the Daily Telegraph. She said small children should not be ‘endlessly watching’, adding: ‘I have been to houses where that happens and I am horrified, because I think “I’m not sure you’re watching anything worthwhile”.’ Ms Whitby claimed the proliferation of children’s TV content during the day has resulted in a 'total loss of the sense of occasion’ and youngsters can’t look forward to a show they can get all the time. She did praise the Horrible Histories series on CBBC but told the Daily Telegraph that the worst programmes on TV nowadays ‘exploit stereotypical characters’ and have ‘no real story’. Good old days: Youngsters watch Prince Charles read a story on TV programme Jackanory in 1984. The hit show, along with Play School, was created by Joy Whitby. Highly-rated: Ms Whitby did praise the Horrible Histories series (pictured) on CBBC but told the Daily Telegraph that the worst programmes on TV nowadays 'exploit stereotypical characters' and have 'no real story' Modern: The manic antics of Spongebob Squarepants are hugely popular with children.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... How long ago did Trump probably pay Cohen 130,000?

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain. EFSA was established in February 2002, is based in Parma, Italy, and has a budget for 2016 of €79.5 million.

His mother gave him 80 more. If now Nigel has 10 more than twice the amount he originally had, how much money did he give away? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"Let's denote the amount of money Nigel gave away as x. Initially, Nigel had 45. After giving some money away, he had 45 - x. His mother then gave him 80 more, so he had (45 - x) + 80. Now, it's given that after this, Nigel has 10 more than twice the amount he originally had. So, the amount he has now should equal 2 * 45 (his original amount) + 10. This can be written as: (45 - x) + 80 = 2 * 45 + 10 Now let's solve this equation to find the value of x: (45 - x) + 80 = 2 * 45 + 10 125 - x = 100 + 10 125 - x = 110 Now, we can find x by adding x to both sides of the equation and then subtracting 110 from both sides to isolate x: 125 - x + x = 110 + x 125 = 110 + x x = 125 - 110 x = 15 So, Nigel gave away 15."},{"question":"Question: what are the parts of a hand called I found the following answer on Google: Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs), each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere , so that handedness , or the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.

Although it is an accurate description of the economic situation during that time, it gives no information about the prevalence and nature of diseases during that period. Instead, an appropriate answer would address the health conditions and diseases that were common or exacerbated due to the Great Depression. For example, the Great Depression led to increases in malnutrition, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression as a result of high unemployment, poverty, and a lack of access to quality healthcare. Illnesses related to malnutrition, like pellagra and rickets, also became more widespread due to limited food sources and a lack of knowledge about proper nutrition. Poverty and overcrowding in urban areas made it easier for infectious diseases to spread, and a lack of resources and inadequate funding for public health programs made it difficult for health officials to address these concerns. Moreover, since people were struggling to meet basic needs, preventative healthcare and timely medical treatment were often neglected, thereby worsening health outcomes. In conclusion, the suggested statement does not provide a suitable answer to the question about diseases during the Great Depression. Instead, an appropriate response would detail the various health issues faced by individuals during that time, such as malnutrition, infectious diseases, and mental health problems, as well as the broader societal factors that contributed to these conditions."},{"question":"Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Another House staffer found the gun and reported it to police. A gun safety group today called for Evans to be fired after he left the gun in the basement bathroom in Jefferson City, Missouri. Danger: Dave Evans (left), a legislative assistant to House Speaker Tim Jones (pictured right), left a loaded handgun in a bathroom at the State Capitol building in Missouri on Friday. A gun safety group is calling for a Missouri House staffer to be fired after he left a loaded handgun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in Jefferson Ci. Rebecca Morgan, spokeswoman for the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: 'Any child could’ve found that gun, or someone could’ve found it and resold it.' According to the police report, Evans has a concealed-carry permit. Police returned the gun to him, and no charges were filed. A 2011 law allows legislative staff with concealed-carry permits to bring firearms into the Capitol. Tom Smith, Jones’ chief of staff, said in a statement on Tuesday that Evans will take a gun safety course in the next few weeks as a result of the incident. 'He is extremely remorseful about this unfortunate incident and willing to take full accountability for his mistake,' Mr Smith said. Ms Morgan said the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action has asked Jones to issue an apology and to fire Evans. The. organization is also calling schools and asking them to cancel their. planned field trips to the Capitol, which houses the Missouri State. Museum. Dave Evans, left a Kahr CM9 9 mm gun, in a public bathroom stall at the Capitol building in Missouri (stock image) The museum received more than 470,000 visitors last year, according to its website. Of those, 30,000 were children on guided tours, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Morgan said that just as mothers call their children’s friends’ houses before play dates to make sure all firearms are secured, parents and schools should be aware of safety risks within the Capitol building. 'My son is supposed to go later in the school year, and I don’t feel safe sending him to the Capitol,' she said. The Moms Demand Action group hopes its effort will help change the 2011 concealed-carry law. 'If (Evans) can have his fully loaded, ready-to-shoot, unattended gun in a restroom and there’s no law against it, the law needs to change,' Morgan said. She said the organization received no direct response from the Capitol. Moms Demand Action describes itself as a grassroots organization that formed nationwide after the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.

Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection. You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering. Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves. If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs. Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away. Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on. Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush. You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time. Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly. When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it. You should only need to use around 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe. If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again. It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering. Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work. Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area. It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered.","response":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on preparing, connecting, and soldering pipes using sandpaper or steel wool for cleaning, choosing the right type of flux, connecting sections together, and properly applying heat and solder to ensure sturdy and sealed pipe connections."},{"question":"Question: Process: - A bird lays eggs in a nest - The parent(s) incubate the eggs - The eggs hatch - The mother (and sometimes the father) bird take care of the baby birds - The baby birds grow up and get their flight feathers - The young birds learn to fly and leave the nest - The adult birds find mates and mate.

When the male birds are not capable of contributing enough resources (e.g., food) to the process of raising offspring, it may become risky for females to invest in a larger number of eggs or chicks, as their chances of survival would be lower.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. Now, I have a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs. Answer this question please: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","response":"To determine which chair has a lower air pressure, we need to consider the effect of the boys' weights on the inflatable chairs and apply Boyle's law. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. The two inflatable chairs are identical, meaning they have the same initial volume and air pressure before the boys sit on them. 2. Boyle's law states that if the temperature is constant, decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure, and vice versa. 3. When Patrick and Mark sit on the chairs, their weights apply a force on the chairs, causing them to compress, which affects the volume of the air inside the chairs. 4. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, the force he applies to the chair is greater, causing the volume of air inside the green chair to decrease even more. 5. As the volume of air inside the green chair decreases more than in the red chair, the pressure inside the green chair increases (according to Boyle's law). Based on the analysis, the red chair, the one Patrick is sitting on, has a lower air pressure as compared to the green chair on which Mark is sitting."},{"question":"- Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back What might be the last step of the process?

Step 2: Notify the campus community Once they had a clear understanding of the situation, they communicated the decision to close the campus through emails, text messages, and social media platforms to reach everyone as quickly as possible. Step 3: Secure the campus The campus security team went through a comprehensive checklist to secure all buildings, making sure that all doors and windows were properly closed and locked, and any potential safety hazards were addressed. Step 4: Coordinate with academic and administrative staff The college administration worked closely with the faculty to reschedule classes and events affected by the closure, making sure that staff had access to the necessary resources to continue their work remotely if needed. Step 5: Provide support and accommodations for students Students living on campus were given clear instructions on how to prepare for the storm and were offered support in case they needed additional assistance, such as those with special needs or medical conditions. Step 6: Monitor the situation and prepare for reopening Throughout the storm, the college closely tracked its progress and impact on the campus, coordinating with the maintenance staff to promptly address any damages or issues that arose due to the severe weather. Step 7: Assess the campus and reopen when safe Once the storm had passed and it was deemed safe to return, the administration conducted a thorough assessment of the campus to ensure it was ready for students and staff to resume their activities. They then communicated the reopening timeline to everyone.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. After reading the above, is \\"Communist\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What Regime took control of Albania after WWII and prior to 1992?\\"?","response":"Yes, according to the text, the Communist regime took control of Albania after World War II and prior to 1992.

Moreover, the time frame until 1992 is indicated by the statement \\"Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992,\\" confirming that a new regime started post-1992.

At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, the number-one single \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\\", and the unreleased \\"The Late Great Johnny Ace\\", which would appear on his 1983 album Hearts and Bones. answer the following question: Whose album was called Hearts and Bones?

John had been convicted of raping and murdering two little white girls. One of the other inmates is a Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck, who is charged with murder and is the first to be executed. Percy demonstrates a severe sadistic and bullying streak but is beyond reproach; he is the nephew of Louisiana's First Lady, but only Paul is bold enough to defy this. He is particularly abusive with inmate Eduard \\"Del\\" Delacroix; he breaks Del's fingers with his baton, steps on a pet mouse named Mr. Jingles, which Del had adopted, repeatedly calls him by a gay slur, and ultimately sabotages his execution by failing to soak the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head; Del's body explodes in flames and he dies screaming in pain. John begins to demonstrate supernatural powers; he cures Paul's bladder infection, resurrects Mr. Jingles, and heals Melinda Moores, wife of the prison's chief warden, of a brain tumor. This last affliction he releases into Percy, who under its influence shoots another prisoner, mass murderer William Wharton, dead.

Of the seven judges, six sided with Maddin but one found in favor of the company and wrote a scathing dissent. Mitch McConnell: Neil Gorsuch 'will be confirmed' for supreme court post Read more That lone judge was Neil Gorsuch, who shortly afterwards made Donald Trump’s shortlist for the supreme court, to fill the seat left by the late Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch is now appearing on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearings. “In my heart of hearts I felt like he willfully tried to negate the human element of my case,” Alphonse Maddin, 48, told the Guardian . “You learn in life to roll with the punches, but I’m concerned because the supreme court has the final say in this country’s affairs, and he’s shown a propensity toward the corporate sector in egregious cases like mine,” he said. Maddin’s case is often brought up by critics seeking to expose Gorsuch as biased in favor of big business. It has become known as “the case of the frozen trucker”. In fact, Maddin had only been driving trucks for about three months, after his career as a graphic designer, serving clients ranging from the city of Detroit and banks to the “big three” US carmakers, had dried up in the great recession that began ahead of the financial crisis of 2008. In January 2009, he was hauling a trailer of meat across rural Illinois at night. The truck was running on fumes when he pulled up at the side of the road after his company, Kansas-based TransAm, gave him muddled information about a refueling location. With the temperature outside an Arctic-level -27F (-33C), the brakes on the 50-plus foot trailer (although not those in his cab) froze in the locked-on position. Maddin radioed in and was told to expect a repairman within the hour. The engine was designed to be incapable of idling and the heater in the bunk area of the cab wouldn’t work. “I bundled up in a blanket as best I could and lay on the bunk,” said Maddin. He woke up three hours later with no sign of a repairman, blue with cold and numb. “I couldn’t feel my feet,” he said. The temperature gauge inside the cab registered -14F. He phoned a relative, his speech slurring – one of the symptoms of hypothermia. He climbed from the cab and could barely stand. Calling the office again, he was given two choices. Try to drive away, dragging the wheel-locked trailer, or “sit tight”. He figured the first was impossible, the second disastrous. “I was afraid I was going to die,” he said. He unhitched the cab from the trailer and despite being low on fuel managed to drive it to a gas station a few miles away, then, within 15 to 30 minutes, returned to find a repairman finally on the scene. After repairs, he delivered the meat. But TransAm Trucking fired him for abandoning his load. Maddin sued under a law that protects drivers who refuse to operate a vehicle in dangerous conditions. Through a series of rulings in Maddin’s favor, which the company challenged, his case ended up before Gorsuch and two other federal appeals court judges on the powerful 10th circuit. Democrats will seek to tie Gorsuch to Trump as a judge soft on big business Read more In August 2016, Maddin won. “I was happy, but also a little exhausted,” he said. In the seven years since being fired, he had struggled to get consistent, decent-paying work, especially as his records said he had abandoned a load. “That’s regarded as a cardinal sin in trucking,” he said. When he won his case, he was given backdated pay and the right to reinstatement. But he didn’t return to a company he felt had a “hiring and firing culture” and “had put its load over my life”. Seven years of stress and poverty – he spent the time without a home of his own, staying with friends and relatives – damaged his relationship with his only child, a daughter who was nine when he was fired, he said. Upon vindication, he didn’t even read Neil Gorsuch’s dissent until the judge was nominated for the supreme court. “Then the first thing I noticed was that in his opening reference he simply called me a trucker and didn’t use my name,” he said. While Maddin had largely won because he was deemed justified in putting his safety above the company’s instructions, Gorsuch disagreed because the law states that it protects someone refusing to operate their truck, whereas Maddin had in effect refused not to operate it, instead insisting on driving to reach shelter. Gorsuch, like conservative supreme court justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, is known as a constructionist – preferring to apply the exact text of a law and avoid interpreting it – and an originalist – a judge who prefers to rely on the US constitution in its original form. Gorsuch’s dissent said it was not the judges’ job to decide whether the decision to fire Maddin “was a wise or kind one”. “Our only task is to decide if it was an illegal one …. and … the law before us protects only employees who refuse to operate vehicles, period,” he wrote. A worker attempting to use a broader interpretation of the law to protect his health and safety was no more a valid legal argument than someone using “an office computer not for work but to compose the great American novel”, he wrote, adding: “Good luck.” He said that judges favoring Maddin leaned toward the so-called Chevron doctrine, where judges defer to government departments to interpret statutes, in this case the Department of Labor. Gorsuch, who established conservative bona fides as a contemporary of Barack Obama’s at Harvard, is against the Chevron precedent, a landmark 1984 case that went in favor of a government regulator, which makes him popular with conservatives because it means his opinions tend to favor business over regulation. Workers’ rights lawyer Bob Fetter, Maddin’s attorney, believes that Gorsuch’s strident dissent in his client’s case was the equivalent of advertising himself to Trump. “He went out of his way to be particularly inhumane in ruling against a worker who almost died trying to do the right thing,” Fetter said. Gorsuch defended his decision at Tuesday’s hearing. Karen Harden, of the National Federation of Independent Business, will testify in support of Gorsuch at the Senate on Thursday, arguing that his tendency to “take the law as it is written” offers important predictability. “Uncertainty kills small business. Gorsuch doesn’t try to rewrite the law, he doesn’t view his job as a legislator,” she said. When Gorsuch was nominated, the US Chamber of Commerce greeted the choice as “fantastic”. Ed Mills, a policy analyst at investment and research company FBR, said business support for Gorsuch comes down not to his individual decisions in cases like Maddin’s but in principle to his “Chevron position”. “Someone who would limit the power of the regulator is regarded as pro-business,” said Mills. Maddin is not moved. He appeared at a press conference in Washington last week alongside leading Democrats, as well as other individuals affected in cases where Gorsuch ruled in favor of corporate interests. “I consider my case a victory for the safety of our workers and the integrity of our nation,” he said. Since he won his case, Maddin has completed a master’s degree in science, aeronautics and unmanned aerospace systems. He is currently looking for work “anywhere in the world”, but designing vehicles, not driving them. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Gorsuch said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that his opinion may have been an “unkind” one, but that it got at “what my job is, and what it isn’t.” The case, which came before Gorsuch as a member of a three-judge appeals panel, concerned a trucker who had been fired from his job because he had unhooked and left his trailer on the side of the road after its brakes had become frozen. A dispatcher had told him to stay with the trailer until a repairman arrived, but in his unheated truck cab in the below-freezing temperatures the trucker became numb and feared for his safety. Gorsuch had disagreed with the rest of panel, which ruled that the trucker was protected by a law the bars truck companies from firing drivers who refuse to operate their vehicles out of fears for their safety. “The law as written said that he would be protected if he refused to operate and I think by any plain understanding he operated the vehicle,” Gorsuch said Tuesday, when asked about the case. “My job isn’t to write the law, Senator. It is to apply the law. And if Congress passes the law saying a trucker in those circumstances gets to choose how to operate his vehicle, I will be the first one in line to enforce it. “ ||||| It’s opening day for the Neil Gorsuch confirmation hearings. Today is just opening statements from the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a statement from the nominee. Which means all we’re getting is a bunch of Senators explaining how they’ll vote before the nominee says a damn thing. Wonderful system we’ve got here. The “point” of today, to the extent that it has one, is just to outline the various lines of attack/defense for tomorrow, and one case has come up multiple times from Democratic Senators. If you have just been casually paying attention to Twitter, you might have heard that Neil Gorsuch froze a truck driver to death… or something. Let’s break that down (pun intended, as you’ll see). The Tenth Circuit decided a case called TransAm Trucking v. Dept. of Labor. Trucker Alphonse Maddin broke down on a freezing Illinois road, at night, out of gas. He called TransAm, they told him to wait with his load. He found that the brakes had frozen. The cab of the truck was unheated. He called TransAm again, who told him to wait again. Hours passed. He called TransAm again, explaining that he had symptoms that sound a lot like the early onset of hypothermia. TransAm told him, according to court records, “to either drag the trailer with its frozen brakes or stay where he was.” After three hours in the cold, Maddin unhitched the trailer and went in search of gas. Eventually, the trailer was secured, and Maddin was fired for violating orders. Maddin sued, and an arbitrator ruled that his termination was illegal under laws that protect employees from being compelled to operate vehicles in unsafe conditions. Appeals ensued, and the Tenth Circuit sided with Maddin, 2 – 1. The one dissenter was Neil Gorsurch, and that is why TransAm Trucking was on the tips of Democratic tongues this morning. Gorsuch wrote: It might be fair to ask whether TransAm’s decision was a wise or kind one. But it’s not our job to answer questions like that. Our only task is to decide whether the decision was an illegal one. The Department of Labor says that TransAm violated federal law, in particular 49 U.S.C. § 31105(a)(1)(B). But that statute only forbids employers from firing employees who “refuse[] to operate a vehicle” out of safety concerns. And, of course, nothing like that happened here. The trucker in this case wasn’t fired for refusing to operate his vehicle. Indeed, his employer gave him the very option the statute says it must: once he voiced safety concerns, TransAm expressly — and by everyone’s admission — permitted him to sit and remain where he was and wait for help. The trucker was fired only after he declined the statutorily protected option (refuse to operate) and chose instead to operate his vehicle in a manner he thought wise but his employer did not. And there’s simply no law anyone has pointed us to giving employees the right to operate their vehicles in ways their employers forbid. Maybe the Department would like such a law, maybe someday Congress will adorn our federal statute books with such a law. But it isn’t there yet. And it isn’t our job to write one — or to allow the Department to write one in Congress’s place. When describing Gorsuch’s dissent this morning, Dick Durbin (D-IL) said: “According to [Maddin’s] recollection, it was 14 degrees below. So cold, but not as cold as your dissent, Judge Gorsuch.” Gorsuch took heat (zing) on that dissent from Senators Durbin, Feinstein, Blumenthal, and Mazie Hirono (D-HI), who spent half her time lighting up his argument. Gorsuch didn’t get a chance to defend himself today, but I’m sure he’s prepared to answer them tomorrow. But, for the uninitiated, this is just kind of how conservative judges roll. His argument wasn’t that Maddin should have stayed there and froze to death, his argument is that the law provides no remedy for a trucker who needs to drive away to save his life. That’s a pretty standard conservative-jurist answer to, you know, problems in society. Victim: I have a problem. Conservative: Does Congress say I should care? Victim: Kinda! Conservative: Not good enough. Obviously, I disagree with Gorsuch’s reasoning here. I think being forced to sit inside a truck is “operating it,” within the meaning of the statute. But I’m not a fan of this line of attack against his confirmation. The problem with textualists is not that their outcomes are bad (though, usually, they’re terrible), it’s that their reasoning limits the law to the dull reading of the text. Congress, to my mind, shouldn’t have to write a whole new law to specify “drivers cannot be ordered to get hypothermia.” The law is perfectly flexible enough to incorporate a “no-hypothermia” rule without additional acts of Congress. But that’s my problem with CONSERVATIVES, not with Gorsuch specifically. It’s my problem with their thought process, not the outcome in a specific Gorsuch case where, in point of fact, he lost anyway. No truckers were frozen to death, under Neil Gorsuch’s watch. There are better lines of attack against Gorsuch. Lines like: “Are you Merrick Garland? No? Then why the f**k are you here?” Or “Do you think women are people? Because your decisions don’t seem to support their fundamental humanity.” Or how about “Is there anything the guy who appointed you can do that will make you choose law over party? Feel free to answer in list form.” Hanging the “bad outcome” on a judicial nominee is never the right way to go. Gorsuch thinks like a conservative. If that’s all the Dems have on him, they best move on. UPDATE (3/21/2017, 10:55 a.m.): Gorsuch Hearings Day 1: If This Is All The Dems Got, They Best Go Home.

(Associated Press) In this image made from a video, Alphonse Maddin, a former truck driver whose case once was heard by Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Wednesday,... (Associated Press) DETROIT (AP) — During Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's Senate confirmation hearings, one case came up repeatedly: A truck driver was fired for leaving his trailer of meat on the side of an Illinois road after breaking down on a frigid night in 2009, fearing he'd freeze to death. The federal appeals court judge last year dissented from a ruling ordering a trucking company to rehire Alphonse Maddin. Gorsuch argued he had to determine whether the trucking company's decision to fire Maddin was legal, not \\"wise or kind.\\" In Detroit, where Maddin lives and 400 miles away from that Capitol Hill hearing room, he finds it \\"surreal\\" his personal story has been the focus of national debate — and is now part of the discussion on whether someone ascends to the nation's highest court. Assured of support from majority Republicans, Gorsuch appears primed to join the bench. But Maddin, 48, is using his unexpected platform to render an opinion on a jurist he believes put ideology above human interest in his case. \\"It makes me consider what would the consequences be if my case had gone to the Supreme Court level and had been adversely impacted by his ideology?\\" Maddin said Wednesday from the conference room of the lawyer who successfully argued on the former truck driver's behalf. Maddin's case has been cited by many Democrats and other critics, who have argued Gorsuch tends to favor business interests over ordinary Americans. Gorsuch counters there are many cases when he has ruled for the little guy, when the law has been on the judge's side. The confirmation hearing will end with outside witnesses talking about Gorsuch. A committee vote then is expected April 3, with a Senate floor vote later that same week. Republicans control the Senate 52-48, so it would require eight Democrats to move Gorsuch past procedural hurdles that require 60 votes. Earlier this month in Washington, Maddin joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and others to share their concerns. Being an activist certainly wasn't Maddin's plan after enduring what he described as a \\"seven-year battle.\\" He declined to return to TransAm Trucking Co., worked several jobs that \\"didn't pay much,\\" and earned bachelor's and master's degrees — the latter focusing on aeronautics. Last August, he happily read the majority decision of the appeals panel, which held that federal law protects drivers from dismissal when they refuse to operate an unsafe vehicle. He paid little attention to the dissent, until he learned President Donald Trump had nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch wrote the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, which bars companies from firing a driver who \\"refuses to operate\\" an unsafe truck, didn't apply to Maddin. Gorsuch reasoned that the truck driver was operating the truck by driving off, not refusing to operate it. Writing for the majority, Judge Michael Murphy said the law could easily be seen as applying to drivers, such as Maddin, who are at risk by staying put. Murphy also directly challenged Gorsuch's narrow, literal meaning of \\"operate.\\" \\"A trucker was stranded on the side of the road, late at night, in cold weather, and his trailer brakes were stuck,\\" Gorsuch, a federal judge in Denver, wrote in his dissent. \\"He called his company for help and someone there gave him two options.

In a post right after his nomination, I called his decision criticizing “Chevron deference” (Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch) brilliant, a thorough and deep defense of judges deciding “what the law is” rather than deferring to agency officials. His opinion in TransAm Trucking v. Administrative Review Board, though, exposes a big hole in Gorsuch’s anti-Chevron theory, showing that judges can abuse statutory interpretation just as badly as bureaucrats. Gorsuch’s opinion in what’s known as the “frozen trucker” case also demonstrates an arrogant and cold judicial personality. I have read very few modern opinions that were more callously written than Gorsuch’s TransAm dissent. Here are the basic facts. Alphonse Maddin was a truck driver for TransAm. Late on a January night in temperatures below zero, he discovered that his trailer’s brakes had locked up due to the cold weather. (The truck itself could drive but not when attached to the trailer). He called TransAm’s road service for help at 11:17 p.m., and then discovered that the truck cabin’s heat was broken. He fell asleep and woke up two hours later with a numb torso. Maddin also could not feel his feet. He called the road service again, and they told him to “hang in there” despite the life-threatening conditions. He waited about 30 more minutes before unhitching the broken trailer. Although his supervisor ordered him to stay, Maddin decided to drive off with the truck after almost three hours in the subzero cold. A service truck did arrive 15 minutes after he left, but it’s hard to blame him for deciding not to risk his life. It’s amazing he waited so long at all. Advertisement TransAm fired Maddin for abandoning his trailer. Maddin filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, an agency of the Department of Labor. He claimed that TransAm had violated the whistleblower part of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, which prohibits an employer from firing an employee who “refuses to operate a vehicle because ... the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public.” The agency concluded that he had indeed been fired for refusing to operate his vehicle, and that he had a reasonable apprehension of danger. Here’s where we get to the legal dispute. TransAm argued that Maddin did operate his truck, so he was not covered by the text of the statute. In the appeal to Gorsuch’s panel (three judges on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals), two judges applied a rule called “Chevron deference,” which means that if a statute is ambiguous, and if Congress delegated interpretive power to an agency, then courts must defer to any reasonable interpretation by the agency. The statute did not define the word operate. The agency decided the word operate includes not only driving but “other uses of a vehicle when it is within the control of the employee.” In other cases, the agency had decided that partially unloading an overweight trailer and driving counted as a “refusal to operate,” because it was a refusal to operate in the directed manner. The majority of the panel also noted that Congress passed the statute so employees would be protected for bringing safety risks to their employers’ attention. Considering all of those factors, the majority found the agency’s interpretation of the ambiguous statute was reasonable. Now, Gorsuch has already told the world he does not believe in Chevron deference. Given that, he was welcome to entertain a better interpretation than the agency’s. For example, instead of focusing on the word operate, one could conclude that the word vehicle is open to interpretation—that the vehicle here was the truck and trailer together. (Legal scholars have noted the ambiguity of the word vehicle for decades via the famous “No Vehicles in the Park” example.) Thus, Maddin refused to operate his vehicle—the truck and trailer—and only operated the truck. The majority probably did not discuss this alternative interpretation because they were engaged in Chevron deference, and deferring to the agency means focusing on its stated interpretation. If Gorsuch finds this case so simple, it’s a warning he will oversimplify future cases when it suits his ideology. Instead of considering such possibilities, Gorsuch concluded that the statute did not protect Maddin from his firing and that he did not find the word operate ambiguous at all, declaring that no possible meaning beyond drive is reasonable. Since Maddin drove his truck, Gorsuch agreed with TransAm that he should not be protected by the whistleblower statute. In a long footnote to its opinion, the majority writes that Gorsuch has decided to change the text of the law from operate to drive, and they quote Gorsuch back to him from oral argument: “Our job isn’t to legislate and add new words that aren’t present in the statute.” Advertisement In addition to Gorsuch’s rewriting of the statute with his preferred narrower term, and in addition to his refusal to entertain his own interpretation (which would be fair from an anti-Chevron judge), Gorsuch’s wording was dismissive of Maddin’s dangerous situation: [S]omeone [at TransAm] gave him two options. He could drag the trailer carrying the company’s goods to its destination (an illegal and maybe sarcastically offered option). Or he could sit and wait for help to arrive (a legal if unpleasant option). The trucker chose None of the Above. Unpleasant? An unheated truck cab in subzero temperatures for three hours? Reading Gorsuch’s dissent is unpleasant; Maddin’s “choice” was life-threatening. Gorsuch throws out “None of the Above” like someone who has thought much more about LSAT multiple-choice questions than about life-and-death decisions. Gorsuch seems to understand the employer’s sarcasm was wrong and exploitative, and yet further along in the dissent he somehow can’t help himself from engaging in that same kind of sarcasm. Turning to the statute’s “refuses to operate” text, he writes, “And of course, nothing like that happened here.” “Of course,” as if this were an obviously easy case. Later, Gorsuch says the statute is “perfectly plain.” If Gorsuch finds this case so simple, it’s a warning he will oversimplify future cases when it suits his ideology. Advertisement He then turns to the facts: “TransAm expressly ... permitted him to sit and remain where he was and wait for help.” Sure, they permitted him to freeze. Where another dissenting judge might have expressed some sympathy but lamented that the statute was not written more clearly, Gorsuch piles on more derision: “Maybe the [Labor] Department would like such a law, maybe someday Congress will adorn our federal statutes with such a law.” Adorn, as if this safety statute was just a fanciful decoration. Let them eat cake. He goes back to the phrase “refuse to operate”: “Imagine a boss telling an employee he may either ‘operate’ an office computer as directed or ‘refuse to operate’ that computer. What serious employee would take that as license to use an office computer not for work but to compose the great American novel? Good luck.” First, Gorsuch is again dismissive of the actual facts. Second, it’s a terrible analogy—a self-parody of the textualist who does not take context seriously. Most rigorous textualists acknowledge that context always matters when you’re trying to understand how a word is used, but in this case Gorsuch refused to consider context. Without making safety and danger part of the context, the workplace safety whistleblower statute does not make sense. Gorsuch’s references also come from his own cloistered world, citing the standardized test (“None of the Above”) and the aspiring novelist. Third: “Good luck”? Which judges write like this? Those who aspire to be the next Scalia. Early in his career, including his first decade or so on the Supreme Court, Scalia was a powerhouse, an engaging writer, and a generative thinker. But by the mid-1990s, he’d become increasingly acerbic. For the most part, he saved his acid pen for colleagues, O’Connor and Kennedy in particular. Gorsuch in this case is abrasive toward an unlucky litigant. It’s injudicious and frigid. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Detroit truck driver Alphonse Maddin, who won his case against delivery company TransAm Trucking, claims that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch showed a bias in favour of big business when he ruled on the case.

Paramilitary soldiers guard near the main entrance of the Minhas in the town of Kamra in Punjab province on August 16, 2012. KAMRA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Islamist militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons fought their way into one of Pakistan's largest air bases on Thursday, the air force said, in a brazen challenge to the nuclear-armed country's powerful military. The attack was repelled and only one aircraft was damaged, said an air force spokesman, adding that the Minhas air base at Kamra, in central Punjab province, did not house nuclear weapons. \\"No air base is a nuclear air base in Pakistan,\\" he said. The gun battle raged for hours, and eight militants and one soldier were killed, the spokesman said. Commandos were called in to reinforce base security forces and police armored personnel carriers could be seen heading into the base. Pakistan's Taliban movement, which is close to al Qaeda and seen as the biggest security threat to the South Asian nation, claimed responsibility for the assault. \\"We are proud of this operation. Our leadership had decided to attack Kamra base a long time ago,\\" Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said by telephone from an undisclosed location. The militants moved through a nearby village under cover of darkness and climbed a nine-foot (2.7-meter) wall strung with barbed wire to break into the base, the air force spokesman said. Some were wearing military uniforms. The assault cast doubts over official assertions that military operations had severely weakened militants waging a violent campaign to topple the U.S.-backed government and impose strict Islamic rule. Security forces opened fire when militants strapped with suicide bombing vests approached aircraft hangars, prompting other militants to fire rocket-propelled grenades from outside the base's walls, said the air force spokesman. Base commander Air Commodore Muhammad Azam, who led the operation against the attackers, was shot in the shoulder but is in stable condition, said spokesman Captain Tariq Mahmood. Search operations for any other militants who may have been hiding in the complex after the attack had ended, he said. About an hour later, a series of small explosions could be heard as homemade bombs planted on the base by the militants were detonated by the military. Minhas, 45 miles northwest of Islamabad, is adjacent to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, a major air force research and development center. Pakistan manufactures JF-17 fighter planes, jointly developed with China, at the site. Suicide bombers launched attacks near the base and the aeronautical complex in 2007 and 2009, but news reports said defenses were not breached. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said there had been an improvement recently in cooperation with Pakistan in trying to squeeze militant networks in the region. \\"And, you know, it's not -- it's not unusual that when they (the militants) feel squeezed, they lash out. But that just speaks to the necessity of continuing our efforts to end their ability to exact violence on Pakistani citizens, or any of us,\\" she said. She said she had no information that would contradict Pakistani statements that there were no nuclear weapons at the site. HOLY MONTH It was not immediately clear how the attackers managed to enter the sprawling base. Although the attack took place at about 2 a.m. (5 p.m. EDT Wednesday), it is likely many of the soldiers on the base were awake for prayers or breakfast during the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Faheemullah Khan, a civilian who lives near the base, said he was at a mosque praying when he heard gunfire and explosions that he thought were military exercises. \\"Then we came to a restaurant, which is next to the main entrance to the base, and heard a louder explosion,\\" he said. \\"We saw six police vans rush in, and realized something was wrong.\\" Several squadrons of fighters and surveillance planes are believed to be based at Minhas. \\"One body of a suicide bomber strapped with explosives has been found close to the impact area,\\" said an air force statement. Pakistan's Taliban has staged a number of high-profile attacks over the past few years, including one on army headquarters in Rawalpindi in 2009. Last year, six Taliban gunmen attacked a naval base in Pakistan's biggest city, Karachi, to avenge the killing of Osama bin Laden. At least 10 military personnel were killed and 20 wounded in the 16-hour assault. Those attacks, and the latest one, are embarrassing for Pakistan's military, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 65-year history and is seen as the most efficient state institution. The Taliban is blamed for many of the suicide bombings across Pakistan, a strategic U.S. ally. Pakistan's military, one of the biggest in the world, has staged several offensives against Taliban strongholds in the unruly tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan. But the operations have failed to break the back of the Taliban. Major suicide bombings have eased considerably over the past year but that could be due to a tactical shift and not pressure from the military.

Militants attacked the air force base filled... (Associated Press) The attack on the base in Kamra, located only about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Islamabad, was a brazen reminder of the threat posed by Islamist militants in Pakistan despite numerous military offensives against their sanctuaries along the Afghan border. The large air base hosts a variety of fighter jets, including F-16s, and contains a factory that makes aircraft and other weapons systems. Some experts suspect the base could house part of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, although the army has denied it has any links to the program. The safety of the country's nuclear weapons has been a major concern for the United States. Western experts say Pakistan has about 100 nuclear weapons and is in the midst of a rapid expansion of its arsenal. The militants, at least some of whom were wearing explosives strapped to their bodies, attacked the base at around 2 a.m. with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, according to the Pakistani air force. At least one of the rockets hit a hanger holding a number of aircraft said Pakistani Air Force spokesman, Tariq Mahmood. The rocket pierced the hanger wall, and shrapnel from the explosion damaged one of the aircraft parked inside. After the rocket barrage, the attackers scaled the wall surrounding the air base, said Mahmood. Guards inside the base then opened fire on the militants, and an intense firefight ensued, he said. In the initial exchange of gunfire one Pakistani soldier was killed. Security forces, backed by a team of elite commandos, fought the militants for two hours and were finally able to retake the base, the air force said. Eight militants and one security personnel were killed in the fighting. The head of the base, Air Commodore Muhammad Azam, was wounded in the shoulder, said Mahmood. Security forces are searching the area for any militants who may have escaped. They found and destroyed two IEDs, the spokesman said. The base is formally known as Air Force Base Minhas. It was named after a pilot, Rashid Minhas, lauded as a hero in Pakistan for foiling attempts by his instructor to defect with an air force plane to arch-rival India in 1971. To stop the escape, Minhas disabled the controls of the plane the two were flying, and died in the resulting crash. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion will likely fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who have waged a bloody insurgency against the government for the past several years that has killed tens of thousands of people. While the group has carried out hundreds of bombings and other attacks through the country, raids against military bases are somewhat uncommon. Half a dozen Taliban militants attacked a major naval base in the southern port city of Karachi in May 2011, killing at least 10 people and destroying two U.S.-supplied surveillance aircraft. It took Pakistani commandos 18 hours to retake Naval Station Mehran, and two of the attackers managed to escape. That the attackers managed to infiltrate so deep into the high-security base led to speculation they may have had inside information or assistance. In 2009, militants dressed in fatigues attacked army headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi, just outside Islamabad, and took 30 people hostage. Pakistani commandos finally raided the compound 22 hours later. Three captives and four militants were among those killed. There have been at least three attacks in the vicinity of the Minhas base since 2007, but all of them occurred outside the installation. In 2009, a suicide bomber on a bicycle blew himself up on a road leading to the base, killing seven people. A year earlier, three rockets were fired at an area near the base, but no one was hurt. In 2007, a suicide car bomber wounded five children on an air force bus carrying them to school near the base. The Pakistani army has carried out numerous offensives against the Pakistani Taliban in the country's semiautonomous tribal area along the Afghan border and appears to be planning an operation in the group's last major sanctuary in North Waziristan. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told The Associated Press earlier this week that Pakistan has informed American military officials that it plans to launch an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in North Waziristan in the \\"near future.\\" It's unclear if the attack on the base in Kamra was conducted in response to the upcoming operation. ____ Abbot was located in Islamabad.

Yes The sentence explicitly states that \\"From the early 13th century, the dominant sacred musical form had been the motet.\\" This clearly answers the question \\"What was the dominant sacred musical form in the early 13th century?\\" by identifying the motet as the primary musical form of that time period. The motet, in historical context, is a key component of early music, specifically within the realm of sacred sounds. Originating from the Medieval period, where voices and instruments were combined to create harmonies, motets were the predominant form of composition, especially in the realm of ecclesiastical or sacred music. In the 13th century, motets were essentially polytextual, meaning they contained more than one text sung simultaneously, often in Latin, with each voice in a different vernacular language. Frequently, these compositions were religious in nature, and would often featured multiple, contrasting musical themes or melodies. Therefore, when the sentence defines the motet as the \\"composition with text in several parts,\\" it is referring to this historical period where motets were the primary form of sacred music and were marked by their polytextual structure. Thus, the sentence not only provides a valid answer to the question posed, but it does so with an ample level of detail about the characteristics of the motet as a dominant sacred musical form during the early 13th century."},{"question":"Given the below context: Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S.

A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or \\"trials\\") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy. - Nassim Nicholas Taleb (alternatively \\"Nessim \\"or\\" Nissim,\\" born 1960) is a Lebanese-American essayist, scholar, statistician, former trader, and risk analyst, whose work focuses on problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty. His 2007 book \\"The Black Swan\\" was described in a review by the \\"Sunday Times\\" as one of the twelve most influential books since World War II. - Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is unbiased, the two outcomes (\\"head\\" and \\"tail\\") are both equally probable; the probability of \\"head\\" equals the probability of \\"tail\\". Since no other outcomes are possible, the probability is 1/2 (or 50%), of either \\"head\\" or \\"tail\\". In other words, the probability of \\"head\\" is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of \\"tail\\" is also 1 out of 2 outcomes, expressed as 0.5 when converted to decimal, with the above-mentioned quantification system. This type of probability is also called a priori probability. - Fooled by Randomness : The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that deals with the fallibility of human knowledge . - A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as statistical consultants. What is the relationship between 'fooled by randomness' and 'statistics'? Answer:","response":"The relationship between 'Fooled by Randomness' and 'statistics' is that the book, written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb - a statistician himself, discusses the role of chance, or randomness, in influencing outcomes in life and financial markets. It highlights how human knowledge can often be deceived by random events, a topic deeply intertwined with statistical concepts. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding randomness and probability in statistics to avoid being misled by apparent patterns or trends that might actually just be random occurrences. It raises questions about our abilities to predict and our perceptions of certainty, major themes in statistical study and application."},{"question":"If you've had a difficult work day what are you hoping to gain when buying beer? Options: - get arrested - relaxation - losing money - pleasure - buzzed Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"1. Analyze the options given: Option A: Get Arrested - This is not a positive outcome, as it would cause further problems and stress. Option B: Relaxation - This option seems positive, as it could potentially relieve stress from a difficult work day. Option C: Losing Money - This is not a positive outcome, and does not seem to be a desired result. Option D: Pleasure - This option also seems positive, as it could help improve one's mood after a difficult day. Option E: Buzzed - This option can be considered neutral or positive depending on personal preferences. It may be considered positive if it helps someone relax after a rough day. 2. Some people might drink beer after a difficult work day to help relieve stress or help them unwind. Therefore, the main goal of buying the beer would be to find some form of respite from the day's challenges. 3. Assuming the primary goal is positive in nature, we can eliminate Options A and C. This narrows it down to Options B, D, and E. 4. Considering the three remaining options, we can determine the following: - Option B (Relaxation) is helpful, as it directly addresses stress from a difficult work day. - Option D (Pleasure) helps improve mood and can also serve as a form of relaxation. - Option E (Buzzed) can be considered, but it may not be the primary goal for everyone. 5. Since relaxation and pleasure are similar and closely related, they seem to be the primary objectives someone might hope to gain when buying beer after a difficult work day. Making a final selection might depend on personal preference. Conclusion: After considering the options and reasoning step-by-step, the most appropriate answer appears to be either Option B (Relaxation) or Option D (Pleasure) as they both provide relief from a difficult work day and align with the main goal of finding respite."},{"question":"Given the question: Title: complete waste of money Review: If you need to actually HEAR a metronome over your music, this is NOT the metronome for you.

Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women. Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—\\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Control\\", \\"When I Think of You\\", and \\"Let's Wait Awhile\\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987.

West also said the President is on a \\"hero's journey.\\" \\"Let's stop worrying about the future, all we have is today,\\" West said, commenting on his own presidential ambitions. \\"Trump is on his hero's journey right now. He might not have thought he'd have a crazy mother-f***r like me (supporting him).\\" The meeting had been billed by the White House as one centered on urban revitalization, workforce training, African-American unemployment, potential future clemencies and crime in Chicago. West told reporters in the Oval Office that he had been asked to speak with the President about the detriments of applying stop-and-frisk policing policies in Chicago. The President has frequently praised the program, telling a group of law enforcement last week that he has urged the city of Chicago to \\"strongly consider stop-and-frisk.\\" The President said during the White House meeting that he's \\"totally open\\" to an alternative to stop-and-frisk. \\"I'm totally open.

Prison reform West also discussed clemency for Larry Hoover, who is serving life in prison in a Supermax facility, calling him a \\"beacon\\" and \\"a living statue.\\" \\"Really the reason why they imprisoned him was because he started doing positive for the community, he started showing that he had power, that he wasn't one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around,\\" West said. \\"It's very important for me to get Hoover out because in an alternate universe I am him and I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago(.)\\" Prosecutors alleged Hoover ran a deadly Chicago gang called the the Gangster Disciples and oversaw a 100 million-a-year illegal drug business from jail, according to The New York Times . Law enforcement authorities caught him giving orders to associates when they would visit him in jail. According to the Times, Hoover worked as political organizer while serving in prison, creating an organization that worked toward education reform and keeping health clinics open in the poor neighborhoods. It's unclear how West learned about Hoover's case, but it has been on his radar for at least a few weeks.

USA TODAY Kanye West shows President Trump a photo of a powered plane he says he's developing with Apple. (Photo: Oliver Contreras, Pool/Getty Images) Kanye West out-Kanyed himself Thursday. The rapper, who has become one of Trump's highest-profile celebrity supporters, visited the White House, where his planned lunch meeting with the president, Jared Kushner and Ivanka, Kid Rock and Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown gave way to a meandering 10-minute monologue. After running up to hug Trump in the Oval Office in his \\"Make America Great Again\\" cap, West told reporters that wearing it made him \\"feel like Superman\\" and reiterated his claim that he had been pressured not to wear it, as he said during his recent appearance on the season opener of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" Kanye West hugs President Donald Trump after arriving in the Oval Office during his White House visit on Thursday. (Photo: Pool, Getty Images) Over the course of the next 10 minutes, West dropped an F-bomb, (\\"Put the beep on however you want to do it and have a five-second delay,” he warned reporters), explained why he famously derided former President Bush as racist while defending Trump (\\"I was in a victim mentality\\") and announced that he had been misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was actually merely sleep deprived. He also unwittingly shared the password to his phone (and really ought to come up with something more secure than 000000), likened his rhetorical style to \\"fine wine\\" (“it has complex notes to it\\") and said he was developing a hydrogen-powered plane with Apple. (West was later spotted at an Apple store in D.C.) He did eventually get around to the primary reason for his visit: ending the gun violence plaguing his hometown of Chicago and convincing Trump to change his position on \\"stop-and-frisk\\" searches, the controversial police practice of temporarily detaining suspects based on \\"reasonable suspicion\\" and searching them for weapons and other contraband. Critics say the policy disproportionately targets blacks and Latinos. The source of Chicago's violence, West argued, \\"is illegal guns.\\" He then stressed, \\"Not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms.” Reaction:The NRA loved Kanye's Oval Office speech. Everyone else? Not so much He continued, “Let’s stop worrying about the future – all we have is today,\\" adding, \\"Trump is on his hero’s journey right now. He might not have thought he’d have a crazy (expletive) like (me) supporting him.” “There was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman,” Kanye West said of his MAGA cap. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) After he finished, the president concluded, \\"He can speak for me any time he wants. He’s a smart cookie. He gets it,\\" adding that West \\"could very well be\\" a future presidential candidate. \\"Only after 2024,\\" the rapper clarified. Kid Rock, another celebrity Trump booster, watched the president sign the landmark Music Modernization Act, which guarantees increased and faster royalty payments for performers, songwriters and producers. The Detroit musician arrived around 11 a.m. and later posed for photos with White House advisor Kellyanne Conway in front of the West Wing Colonnade. After the signing ceremony, he said, \\"Everybody knows that this music of business is a pretty dirty business … But this is a great start to protect songwriters, producers, engineers – the unsung heroes behind many of these songs that go out there.\\" Turning to Trump, he added “There's a whole lot of people in this country that do give you a lot of credit for everything you’ve been doing for this country. We know that some people don’t give you as much as maybe they should sometimes.\\" This isn't the first high-profile meeting between Trump and either musician. Kid Rock visited the Oval Office in April 2017 and West famously traveled to Trump Tower in December 2016, where he discussed \\"multicultural issues\\" with the then-president-elect and posed for photos in the building's lobby. The White House confirmed that West would be meeting with the president, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders saying that their conversation topics would include \\"manufacturing resurgence in America, prison reform, how to prevent gang violence, and what can be done to reduce violence in Chicago.” West's wife Kim Kardashian has also visited Trump in the White House several times, first meeting with Trump to champion the case of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who spent more than two decades in prison on drug charges. After Trump granted Johnson clemency, Kardashian traveled to the White House again for a meeting about prison reform. West's visit comes after he deleted his social media accounts following his appearance on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" where he donned his \\"Make America Great Again\\" hat to deliver an impromptu speech praising Trump and criticizing Democrats. West noted that white people ask him, ‘'How could you like Trump, he’s racist’?

A member of the Republican Party, he was the junior United States Senator from Oklahoma. Coburn was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as part of the Republican Revolution. He upheld his campaign pledge to serve no more than three consecutive terms and did not run for re-election in 2000. Context: After three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent Republican Don Nickles. Former Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner Bob Anthony joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys's 25%. In the general election, he faced Brad Carson, a Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms. In the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the heavily Democratic 2nd District generally, Coburn swamped Carson in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area and the closer-in Tulsa suburbs. Coburn won the state's two largest counties, Tulsa and Oklahoma, by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes. Coburn's Senate voting record is as conservative as his House record. Coburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election. While he originally planned to not seek a third term due to his self-imposed two term limit, on January 16, 2014 Coburn announced he would resign his office at the end of the year due to his declining health. On April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress) into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014. Question: what came of this? Answer:","response":"The Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress) that was introduced by Senator Tom Coburn on April 29, 2014, aimed to clarify certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the capital requirements for insurance companies. The bill received bipartisan support and was passed by the Senate on June 3, 2014. The main goal of the bill was to address concerns that insurance companies could face excessive and potentially inappropriate capital regulations within the framework of the Dodd-Frank Act. The legislation intended to allow insurance firms to be exempted from the capital standards applied to banks so that they would not be adversely affected by the regulations designed primarily for banking institutions. The Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 sought to amend the appropriate section of the Dodd-Frank Act to better tailor regulations for insurance companies. The bill acknowledged the unique business models and differing risk exposures of insurance firms compared to banks, and aimed to prevent unintended consequences that could negatively impact the insurance industry and its consumers. After being passed by the Senate, the bill was sent to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration. On June 24, 2014, the House voted in favor of the bill with a 402-0 majority. Following this overwhelming support from both chambers of Congress, the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 was signed into law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2014. The enactment of this legislation demonstrated a commitment to ensuring appropriate regulatory standards for different sectors within the financial industry. By addressing the concerns of the insurance industry and amending the Dodd-Frank Act accordingly, the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 helped maintain the stability and efficiency of the insurance market while reducing the potential for unintended negative consequences on the economy."},{"question":"BBC analysis of NHS figures showed nearly 475,000 patients waited for more than four hours for a bed on a ward in 2015-16 - almost a five-fold increase since 2010-11. Hospitals reported using side rooms and corridors to cope with the growing number of \\"trolley waits\\". NHS bosses acknowledged problems, blaming \\"growing demand\\" on the system. But doctors said hospitals were now dangerously overcrowded, with three quarters of hospitals reporting bed shortages as winter hits. Bed occupancy is not meant to exceed 85% - to give staff time to clean beds, keep infections low and ensure patients who need beds can be found them quickly. But 130 out of 179 hospital trusts are reporting rates exceeding this for general hospital beds. Hospital managers said the problem was causing \\"deeply worrying\\" delays for these patients. They are people who have already faced a wait to be seen in A&E but whose condition is deemed to be so serious they need to be admitted on to a ward. About one in five people who come to A&E fall into this category and it includes the frail elderly and patients with chest pains, breathing problems and fractures. 11% of emergency patients face a 4 hour \\"trolley wait\\" 5x increase in numbers waiting over 4 hours for a bed since 2011 474,453 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2015-16 97,559 patients waited +4 hours for a bed 2010-11 The BBC analysed official NHS England figures and found 473,453 patients waited more than four hours for a bed between October 2015 and September 2016 - 11% of the 4.2 million patients admitted in total during the period. More than 1,400 of them faced delays of more than 12 hours. It compares with 97,559 \\"trolley waits\\" in 2010-11 - although NHS England pointed out a small fraction of the rise could be attributed to a change in the way the waits were measured in December 2015. Directly comparable figures are not available for other parts of the UK, although data suggests there is an increasing strain on beds. While the delays are known as \\"trolley waits\\" not all patients find themselves on one. Hospitals use all sorts of areas, including side rooms, seats in the A&E department and spare cubicles depending on what is available. Rupert Nathan, 55, was rushed to hospital in an ambulance when he started suffering chest pains at home in June. He had previously had two angioplasties - one in 2000 and one in 2001 - because of angina and feared he was having a heart attack. He was taken by ambulance to Barnet Hospital in north London and was given blood and heart tests. At that point, staff decided to admit him for further checks. But he spent more than five hours waiting for a bed. \\"I was left in a waiting area with my girlfriend. I was in pain and really concerned. There was little contact with staff and it was after midnight when I was finally found a bed.\\" He asked for morphine and was told he would undergo scans in the morning. But when morning came, he was in a much better state and was discharged. \\"I was told the delays were because it was very busy. I could see that, but it's still not acceptable.\\" Mr Nathan has made a complaint about his care. The hospital said it was sorry about the long wait, but said this can happen at busy times. It said it had to prioritise patients and maintained the way he was cared for was \\"appropriate\\". Siva Anandaciva, of NHS Providers which represents hospitals, said: \\"These figures are deeply worrying. We are heading into winter in a more fragile state than I have seen in the past 10 years or so. \\"Even the historically top-performing trusts are being challenged, which shows that this is an issue affecting all parts of health. \\"No-one wants to see people waiting in corridors, side rooms and emergency bays when they should be admitted to a hospital bed. These patients are still under the care of doctors and nurses of course, but it is not ideal for them and we know overcrowding leads to worse outcomes.\\" Dr Chris Moulton, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, echoed the concerns. \\"Patients who are delayed like this are still being monitored by staff. But we know that the overcrowding we are seeing is dangerous. It leads to worse outcomes for patients - higher infection rates, patients ending up on the wrong wards and generally a negative experience.\\" Dr Moulton believes there are too few beds. There are just over 100,000 general beds in England - a fall of 40,000 in the past 20 years. \\"We simply don't have enough. If you compare us to other European countries we are really short and the demands being placed on the health service means we are now struggling to cope,\\" he added. A spokesman for NHS England said \\"growing demand\\" was putting pressure on the system - the number of emergency admissions having risen by more than 500,000 in five years to 4.2 million. But he added it was \\"a tribute to front-line staff\\" that the NHS was able to handle so many patients.

And I was wondering What will Jesse want to do after taking a picture? A:","response":"It is not possible to determine with certainty what Jesse will want to do after taking a picture at the peak of the mountain because people may have different preferences and motivations for their actions. However, I can provide a detailed analysis of some probable activities Jesse might choose to engage in based on common interests and experiences people have when climbing mountains and reaching their peak. 1. Appreciate the view: Given the effort required to climb a mountain, Jesse might want to take some time to enjoy the breathtaking views from the peak. The panoramas at high altitudes can be awe-inspiring. By admiring the landscape, they can absorb the beauty of their surroundings and celebrate their accomplishment. 2. Rest and refuel: Climbing a mountain can be physically demanding, so Jesse might want to take a break, sit down, and enjoy a snack or a meal after taking the picture. Resting allows them to regain their strength and energy before beginning the descent or taking part in other activities. 3. Share experiences with others: If Jesse is climbing the mountain with a group, they might want to share their experiences with fellow climbers after taking the picture. Engaging in conversation can deepen social connections and create a shared sense of achievement. 4. Document the experience further: Apart from taking a picture, Jesse might want to continue documenting their experience through other means, such as writing in a journal, creating a video log, or collecting small mementos from the peak to memorialize their adventure. 5. Meditation or reflection: Reaching the peak of a mountain can be a profound experience, and some people might choose to use that time for meditation or personal reflection. Jesse may want to contemplate their journey or find inner peace and mindfulness amidst the serenity of nature at the summit. 6. Explore the peak: Jesse might want to spend some time exploring the area around the summit, looking for unique geological features or observing flora and fauna that can be found at high altitudes. 7. Engage in adventure sports: Depending on the characteristics of the mountain and the conditions during their climb, Jesse might want to engage in adventure sports such as paragliding, snowboarding, or even climbing to an adjacent peak if available. 8. Begin the descent: After taking the picture, Jesse might choose to start their descent from the mountain, ensuring they have enough time and energy to get back safely. Descending can be equally challenging and time-consuming as ascending and may require a proper plan and strategy. Ultimately, it is up to Jesse to define their objectives and decide what they want to do after taking a picture at the mountain peak.

Movie title: Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 Context: As is the case with the two preceding 'Smokey and the Bandit' films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizeable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000.

He puts 2 away in January, 4 away in February, 8 away in March, 16 away in April and follows this savings pattern through to December. How much money does he have to spare and save by December? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","response":"Derek's savings pattern follows a pattern where each month, he saves double the amount he saved the previous month. To calculate his total savings by December, we can find the sum of the savings amount for each month. January: 2 February: 4 (2 * 2) March: 8 (4 * 2) April: 16 (8 * 2) And so on. We can observe that this is a geometric series with 12 terms, a starting value (a) of 2, and a common ratio (r) of 2. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the following formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) Where S is the sum, n is the number of terms in the series, and a and r are as mentioned above. Here, n = 12 terms (one for each month), a = 2 (initial savings), and r = 2 (each month's savings is double the previous month's). Plugging these values into the formula: S = 2 * (1 - 2^12) / (1 - 2) S = 2 * (1 - 4096) / (-1) S = 2 * 4095 S = 8190 So by December, Derek will have saved 8190 in total."},{"question":"Concepts: look, microwave, oven Write a sentence that includes all these words.","response":"Upon entering the brightly lit kitchen, Jane couldn't help but look at the sleek and gleaming new combination microwave oven sitting elegantly on the countertop, patiently awaiting its first use in preparing the family's favorite meals."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est mignon.\\" This means, in simple words, \\"The cat is cute\\" in French.

Options: - yes - no - it is not possible to tell Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"The hypothesis is a rephrased version of the premise, but with some key differences. The premise states that there is a large man stopped at an intersection on a scooter. The hypothesis, however, says that a small man was stopped at an intersection by a scooter. The differences are the size of the man (large vs. small) and the wording suggests a different situation (on a scooter vs. stopped by a scooter). Step-by-step analysis: 1. \\"A large man\\" in the premise becomes \\"A small man\\" in the hypothesis. This changes the size of the man, which is a key detail. 2. \\"Stopped at an intersection on a scooter\\" in the premise is rephrased as \\"stopped at an intersection by a scooter\\" in the hypothesis.

The launch of BBC Store is a sign that as the years go by programmes can go from being impossible to show to being a way of generating a little extra revenue. So - beyond the familiar classic series over the BBC's history what programmes ought to be picked out from the archive? Here's a collection of a few programmes that were in their time on the BBC's \\"do not show under any circumstance\\" list and a few that will probably never appear on the store. A documentary about Harold Wilson and the Labour Cabinet after losing the 1970 election. The mocking tone and the questions about money making from Wilson's memoirs so enraged the former Prime Minister that it wasn't shown on the BBC for 42 years. It's now been shown in full on BBC Parliament. Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels starred in a violent tale about a young offenders institute. The violence, gang rape and racism were too much for the BBC controller Billy Cotton who banned it in 1977. It was finally shown in 1991. The film that followed it and caused a similar level of disquiet was The Firm about football hooligans. It was subjected to a number of cuts before it was shown but still caused a furore. It's now on the BBC store. At the time it was a jolly jape with Prince Edward and Princess Anne as team captains in a royal celebrity version of \\"It's a Knockout'. Toyah, George Lazenby, Su Pollard, John Travolta, John Cleese and Meatloaf all took part in the programme that has never been repeated. The show was anything but regal. There is also the now very uncomfortable presence of Stuart Hall - the presenter has been convicted for a string of sexual assaults on young girls. Chances of being released from the BBC vault? Low. The first series was shown in 1965 and never shown again. The witch was considered far too scary for younger viewers.","response":"The article discusses various BBC programmes that were once banned or withheld from transmission due to their controversial content. One such programme is the 1976 Dennis Potter drama Brimstone and Treacle, which was considered \\"nauseating\\" by the BBC's director general at the time, Alasdair Milne. The launch of the BBC Store has allowed such programmes to go from being prohibited to generating revenue for the network.

The documentary, which mocked Wilson and questioned the financial gains from his memoirs, was banned from the BBC for 42 years. The content has since been aired in full on BBC Parliament. Another controversial programme is a violent tale about a young offenders institute featuring Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels. The violence, gang rape, and racism depicted in the programme were deemed too much for BBC controller Billy Cotton, and it was banned in 1977. The film eventually made it to the screens in 1991. The Firm, a separate film about football hooligans, faced a similar fate but has since found its way onto the BBC Store. One unique and largely forgotten show on the list was a royal celebrity version of \\"It's a Knockout,\\" featuring team captains Prince Edward and Princess Anne, and participants such as Toyah, George Lazenby, Su Pollard, John Travolta, John Cleese, and Meatloaf. The programme has never been repeated due to its lack of regal decorum and the involvement of presenter Stuart Hall, who has been convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault.

Solve 0 = -39*l - 16 - 179 for l.","response":"To solve the equation 0 = -39*l - 16 - 179 for l, follow these steps: 1. Combine the constant terms. The equation has two constant terms, -16 and -179. 2. Calculate the sum of the constant terms. -16 + (-179) = -195 3. Rewrite the equation with the combined constant terms. 0 = -39*l - 195 4. To solve for l, isolate the variable l by moving the constant term to the opposite side of the equation. Add 195 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 195 = -39*l + 195 195 = -39*l 5. Next, divide by the coefficient of l, which is -39. 195 / (-39) = -39*l / (-39) 6. Calculate the quotient. -5 = l 7.

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we should delve deeper into the historical context, the core beliefs of the Reformation, and the primary motivations of its key figures. Martin Luther, a German theologian and monk, initiated the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century. His primary objective was to challenge and reform the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which he believed had long deviated from the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Luther's main principle can be better encapsulated in the concepts of \\"Sola Scriptura,\\" \\"Sola Fide,\\" \\"Sola Gratia,\\" and \\"The Priesthood of all Believers.\\" 1. Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone): Luther asserted that the Bible alone should be the ultimate authority on Christian beliefs, practices, and faith. This principle stands in contrast to the Catholic tradition, where authority was derived not only from the Scriptures but also from Church hierarchy, tradition, and the Pope's authority. By emphasizing sola scriptura, Luther aimed to refocus Christian faith on its original source — the Word of God. 2. Sola Fide (Faith Alone): Luther was particularly troubled by the prevalent practice of indulgences in the Catholic Church, a system in which people could essentially buy their way into heaven by purchasing pardons for sins or by aiding the construction of churches. Luther believed that salvation was not obtained through good deeds, the purchase of indulgences, or participation in Church rituals. Instead, it was obtained solely through faith in Jesus Christ and his sacrificial atonement for humanity's sins. This principle of sola fide was fundamentally based on the teachings found in the New Testament. 3. Sola Gratia (Grace Alone): This principle emphasizes that God's grace, rather than human efforts or merits, is the ultimate source of salvation. Luther argued that although human beings are inherently sinful and undeserving, God, through his kindness and generosity, offers the free gift of salvation by grace alone. This belief was a direct challenge to the Catholic Church's stance on the role of good works, sacraments, and penance in achieving salvation. 4. The Priesthood of all Believers: Luther believed that each individual believer should have direct access to God without the need for ecclesiastical mediators, such as priests. This was a radical departure from the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church, where the clergy was set apart as a privileged group with unique access to divine grace. By embracing the priesthood of all believers, Luther advocated for a personal relationship with God, with each believer actively engaging in the study of the Scriptures and serving as a minister to others. In conclusion, Martin Luther's main principle transcends the single statement provided. It can more accurately be described as a combination of principles – Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, and The Priesthood of all Believers – which aimed to challenge corruption, restore the authority of the Bible, and emphasize the importance of faith and grace in achieving salvation. These principles became the foundation for the teachings of Luther and the later reformers, eventually giving rise to the various Protestant denominations we know today."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point. suppose more heat available happens, how will it affect LESS salt being removed from the water. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"In the given process of saltwater purification, more heat availability will affect the salt removal from the water. To understand how this perturbation will impact the process, it is important to analyze each step and its relationship with the heat availability. 1. Saltwater is contained in a factory or plant: This step is not directly affected by heat availability as it only deals with the containment of saltwater. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature: This is the step where more heat availability will have a direct impact. Increased heat availability results in boiling the water more efficiently. In the context of removing salt from the water, boiling plays a critical role in separating salt from the water through evaporation. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water: This step is indirectly impacted by the heat availability. As more heat is available, the water will boil at a faster rate, leading to more steam being produced. Since salt does not evaporate, it stays behind in the boiling container. Thus, more efficient boiling could lead to better salt separation. 4. The salt is removed: This step is indirectly affected by the heat availability. When more salt gets separated from the water due to increased boiling efficiency, it becomes easier to remove the salt from the remaining solution. 5. The water is drinkable at this point: This step is also indirectly affected by heat availability. When more heat is supplied, the salt removal process becomes more thorough, resulting in cleaner and drinkable water at the end of the process. Based on the analysis of each step, more heat availability will indirectly impact the salt removal process. This perturbation would be classified as \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" As more heat is available, it directly affects the boiling step which then indirectly influences the salt separation, salt removal, and drinkable water production."},{"question":"Next question: when was the new 1 pound coin released?","response":"The new 1 pound coin was released on March 28, 2017.

Philadelphia took flight in the first quarter with wide receiver DeSean Jackson's 67-yard touchdown run and linebacker Will Witherspoon (recently acquired from the Rams) returning an interception 9 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead with a 47-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Redskins would get on the board with quarterback Jason Campbell completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Thomas, yet Philadelphia answered with Akers nailing a 44-yard field goal and quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jackson. Washington would close out the half with a 47-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham. In the third quarter, both defenses fought back and forth and the period ended with no points. In the fourth and final quarter, Jason Campbell completed a one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Fred Davis for the only score of the second half The Eagles defense held on and, with the win, Philadelphia improved to 4-2.

Answer:","response":"To find the difference between David Akers' longest and shortest field goals in this game, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the lengths of David Akers' field goals: David Akers made a 47-yard field goal and a 44-yard field goal. 2. Calculate the difference between the two field goals: Subtract the shorter field goal distance from the longer field goal distance. 47 yards (longest) - 44 yards (shortest) = 3 yards So, David Akers' longest field goal was 3 yards longer than his shortest field goal."},{"question":"The 2016 SEC Championship Game was played on Saturday, December 3, 2016 in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, and determined the 2016 football champion of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - Yine de: This phrase works as a conjunction, and it translates to \\"still\\" or \\"nevertheless\\" in English. It is used to indicate that despite something previously mentioned, the following statement holds true. - Çoğu katılımcı: It translates to \\"a majority of respondents\\" or \\"most participants\\" in English. - Çoğu: means \\"most\\" or \\"a majority of\\" - Katılımcı: means \\"participant\\" or \\"respondent\\" - Hükümete: It is the noun \\"hükümet\\" (government) in the dative case, meaning \\"to/for the government\\" in English. - Güven duyuyor: This verb phrase means \\"to have faith\\" or \\"to trust\\" in English. It is used in present continuous tense, so it translates to \\"having faith\\" or \\"trusting.\\" - Güven: means \\"trust\\" or \\"confidence\\" - Duyuyor: This verb is derived from \\"duymak\\" (to feel or to sense). In this phrase, it is used in the present continuous tense (iyor) and gives the meaning of \\"feeling\\" or \\"sensing.\\" - ve: This conjunction means \\"and\\" in English. - Gelecek için: It indicates \\"for the future.\\" \\"Gelecek\\" means \\"future,\\" and \\"için\\" means \\"for.\\" - Umut ifade ediyor: This verb phrase translates to \\"expressing hope\\" in English. - Umut: means \\"hope.\\" - İfade ediyor: It is a present continuous verb phrase that means \\"expressing.\\" \\"İfade etmek\\" is the base verb, which means \\"to express.\\" It is combined with the present continuous tense marker \\"iyor\\" to give the meaning of \\"expressing.\\" Thus, the final long sentence in Turkish is: \\"Yine de, çoğu katılımcı hükümete güven duyuyor ve gelecek için umut ifade ediyor.\\""},{"question":"Teknik adam takımın Şampiyonlar Ligi'ne katılmasına yardım etse de, Barcelona'nın sahipleri onu görevden aldılar ve yeni bir teknik direktör getirdiler. Could you please translate this to English?","response":"The sentence translates to English as follows: \\"Even though the coach helped the team participate in the Champions League, the owners of Barcelona removed him from his position and brought in a new technical director.\\" In this sentence, it appears that the coach of the Barcelona football team had achieved some success by helping the team to secure a place in the Champions League. The UEFA Champions League is one of the most prestigious tournaments at the club level in Football, which means it's a significant achievement for any coach. However, despite this success, the owners of Barcelona decided to remove him from his position. The owners of a football club have the final say on major decisions like this, and they would have made this choice based on a variety of possible reasons. Such reasons could include disagreements over the direction of the team, the style of play, the coach's relationship with the players or the management, financial issues, or a myriad of other behind-the-scenes factors. After removing the initial coach, the owners appointed a new technical director. The 'technical director' here refers to a new head coach or manager who will be responsible for team strategy, player selection, training, and overall team performance. The decision to bring a new coach might be aimed at bringing a fresh perspective to the team's strategy, rejuvenating performance, managing team dynamics differently, or even for better alignment with the owners' vision for the team's future. Ultimately, these changes demonstrate that in football, and indeed in professional sports, achieving success is important, but there are many moving parts and variables at play behind the scenes that can lead to such significant decisions."},{"question":"Q:What was offered to the city of Reykjavík as a gift? Answer the above question based on the context below: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Traditionally, the Nile River flooding season took place between June and September, with peak flooding typically occurring in August. The Nile River consists of two primary tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The primary cause of the Nile River flooding is the heavy summer rainfall experienced in the Ethiopian Highlands, the source region of the Blue Nile. As the rainwater flows downstream, it merges with the calmer White Nile, causing the water levels to rapidly rise and overflow the riverbanks. The annual flood played a vital role in Ancient Egypt's agricultural success because it deposited a fresh layer of nutrient-rich silt over the surrounding fields, replenishing the soil and enabling the growth of bountiful harvests. The Egyptian civilization, situated along the Nile River, relied heavily on the inundation as it brought water and fertility to their otherwise arid land. In Ancient Egyptian culture, the flooding of the Nile was celebrated and closely associated with the deity Hapi, the god of fertility and abundance. This life-giving inundation was a critical element in their mythology and religious ceremonies, deeply influencing their civilization and way of life. However, in modern times, the annual flooding of the Nile River has been significantly regulated by the construction of dams and other water management infrastructures. The Aswan High Dam, completed in 1970, has had the most significant impact on the Nile flooding, effectively controlling and stabilizing water flow throughout the year. While this has led to significant social, economic, and agricultural benefits – such as increased cultivable lands, improved irrigation, and the generation of hydroelectric power – it has also resulted in the loss of the traditional inundation's fertility benefits and alterations in the surrounding ecosystems. In summary, the Nile River used to flood annually between June and September, with peak flooding in August, primarily due to heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands. However, the construction of modern dams, particularly the Aswan High Dam, has significantly altered these annual floods, regulating water flow and minimizing the inundation's impact on the surrounding areas."},{"question":"Notable Old Etonians in the media include the former Political Editor of both ITN and The Times, Julian Haviland; the current BBC Deputy Political Editor, James Landale, and the BBC Science Editor, David Shukman; the current President of Conde Nast International and Managing Director of Conde Nast UK, Nicholas Coleridge; the former ITN newscaster and BBC Panorama presenter, Ludovic Kennedy; current BBC World News and BBC Rough Justice current affairs presenter David Jessel; former chief ITV and Channel 4 racing commentator John Oaksey; 1950s BBC newsreader and 1960s ITN newscaster Timothy Brinton; 1960s BBC newsreader Corbet Woodall; the former Editor of The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore; the former Editor of The Spectator, Ferdinand Mount; and the current Editor of The Mail on Sunday, Geordie Greig.

Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, particularly French. English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England, and was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible, and the start of the Great Vowel Shift. Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire, modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries.

Tom had been smoking tobacco all these years and had some health problems related to that, while Randy quit smoking 25 years ago. and a hint : Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Please answer this question : Which friend was exposed more to one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens? The answer is:","response":"Tom was exposed more to one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. This is because he had been smoking tobacco for the past 20 years, as mentioned in the given situation. Tobacco smoke contains dozens of chemicals, including nicotine, that have been proven to cause cancer. These chemicals are known as carcinogens. By continually smoking, Tom was exposing himself to a significantly higher concentration of these harmful substances compared to Randy, who had quit smoking 25 years ago. Tobacco smoke is recognized as one of the primary sources of chemical carcinogens, and regular exposure to these substances increases the risk of developing several types of cancers, such as those affecting the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. In Tom's case, he has already experienced health problems related to his tobacco use, which only emphasizes the dire consequences of being exposed to these harmful chemicals over an extended period. On the other hand, Randy's decision to quit smoking 25 years ago has significantly reduced his exposure to these carcinogens. When a person quits smoking, their body begins the process of repairing some of the damage that has been caused by the harmful substances present in tobacco smoke. Over time, this significantly lowers their risk of developing cancer and various other health complications associated with smoking. Although Randy may have been exposed to some chemical carcinogens during his time as a smoker, it is evident that his overall exposure was significantly lower as compared to Tom. In summary, Tom was the friend who was exposed more to one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens due to his continued smoking for the past 20 years. This prolonged exposure increased his risk of developing cancer and presented him with other health-related issues. On the contrary, Randy's decision to quit smoking 25 years ago greatly reduced his exposure to these chemical carcinogens and lowered his risk of falling victim to the detrimental health effects caused by tobacco smoke."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: Unfortunately this is also true of legislation on air quality.","response":"Valitettavasti tämä koskee myös ilmanlaatua koskevaa lainsäädäntöä."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In the recent times, there have been increased calls for political intervention to tackle this cross-border problem promptly. Construction workers in the region have cited concerns over inconsistencies in standards, skills recognition, and enforcement. This article aims to shed light on the current situation, the implications of this issue, and the possible solutions to address the problem. Background: The construction industry in Northern Ireland – and the United Kingdom at large – is subject to stringent health and safety regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure workers' safety and minimize accidents on construction sites. In line with this, construction workers are required to undergo health and safety training courses periodically. However, recent issues have emerged regarding the recognition and validity of these training courses, especially in the context of Northern Ireland's shared border with the Republic of Ireland. The Problem: The primary concern for Northern Irish construction workers is that health and safety training courses completed in the Republic of Ireland are often not recognized by construction companies and regulators in Northern Ireland. This essentially means that workers who have completed the necessary training and hold valid certification are being denied the opportunity to work on construction projects on Northern Ireland soil. Conversely, Northern Irish workers may need to retake courses to validate their qualifications once in the Republic of Ireland. Employers and regulators argue that differences in health and safety training standards and enforcement mechanisms make it difficult to ascertain the credibility and equivalence of qualifications obtained across the border. This situation creates confusion and frustration for construction workers, leading to potential exploitation in the workforce and hindering the construction sector from reaping the full benefits of cross-border cooperation. The Need for Political Intervention: Addressing this problem requires not only collaboration within the construction industry but also intervention by political representatives. Politicians have the power to influence standards and regulations to ensure better alignment of health and safety requirements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. They can promote dialogues between certification bodies, regulators, and construction companies in both jurisdictions to identify areas of commonality and establish mutual recognition of skills and qualifications. Furthermore, politicians can scrutinize and amend existing legislative frameworks to better safeguard the needs of construction workers. This process might entail the introduction of legal provisions that compel construction companies to recognize the validity of health and safety training courses from both regions. Political intervention can drive transparency and consistency, leading to a fairer system and facilitating labor mobility in the sector. Conclusion: The cross-border health and safety training crisis in Northern Ireland's construction sector represents a significant barrier to growth, skill development, and worker protection. Addressing the issue necessitates concerted efforts by multiple stakeholders, particularly political representatives, to align standards and regulations across the region. Ultimately, through effective collaboration and political intervention in this matter, the construction sector can strive towards a more unified cross-border environment that promotes worker safety and enhances opportunities for all."},{"question":"Write an article based on this \\"Sad news for fans of Peter Capaldi - he's leaving Doctor Who at the end of the year, it's been announced.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Peter Capaldi Bids Farewell to Doctor Who at Year's End Introduction: Beloved actor Peter Capaldi, known for his role as the twelfth Doctor in the popular British sci-fi series Doctor Who, has announced his departure at the conclusion of the year.

Solve 11*o + 26*o + 156 = 63*o for o.","response":"Alright, let's break this down step by step. We have this equation: 11*o + 26*o + 156 = 63*o First, let's combine the terms with 'o' on the left side of the \\"=\\" sign: (11*o + 26*o) + 156 = 63*o Now, if we add 11*o and 26*o together (like adding 11 apples and 26 apples, which gives us 37 apples), we get: 37*o + 156 = 63*o Next, we want to get all the 'o' terms on one side of the \\"=\\" sign. Let's subtract 37*o from both sides of the equation (imagine taking away 37 apples from both sides of the \\"=\\" sign): 37*o - 37*o + 156 = 63*o - 37*o This simplifies to: 156 = 26*o Now, we want to find out what one 'o' is worth. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 26 (like sharing 26 candies equally between friends). Here's what the equation looks like: 156 ÷ 26 = 26*o ÷ 26 This simplifies to: 6 = o So, the solution to the equation is o = 6."},{"question":"This was 20 years ago, maybe. My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar?

She wanted to be a math teacher but became an architect instead, because the","response":"demand for architects was much higher than for math teachers at the time. The decision was a pragmatic one, yet her passion for mathematics never waned. In fact, she found ways to incorporate her love for math into her architectural designs, making them innovative and unique. Step 1: Reflect on the existing text to understand the direction of the story. Justification: It is important to first understand the context and the story's progression to ensure the continuity and consistency of the narrative. Step 2: Develop the character's background and identify potential conflicts or themes to be explored. Justification: Adding depth to the character and their story can make the narrative more engaging and relatable for the reader. In her architectural projects, she would often integrate mathematical concepts, such as symmetry, proportions, and tessellation, which garnered attention from critics and the general public alike. Her unique perspective earned her a reputation as a forward-thinking architect. Step 3: Establish the character's motivations and aspirations, while showing how the protagonist faces challenges in their chosen field. Justification: Demonstrating the character's determination and passion can create a relatable and inspiring narrative. Despite her success in the architectural world, she still longed for the chance to share her passion for mathematics with others. She began volunteering at local schools, offering after-school tutoring sessions to students who struggled with math. Step 4: Show how the character bridges the gap between their original desires and their current profession. Justification: Combining the character's original passion with their current profession can create a fulfilling and well-rounded story. Over time, she started to develop a following of students who were inspired by her unique approach to teaching mathematics, using architectural concepts to make the subject more accessible and enjoyable. Her impact in the educational community didn't go unnoticed – eventually, she was invited to speak at educational conferences and collaborate with schools on designing innovative math curricula. Step 5: Illustrate the character's influence within their community and how they inspire others. Justification: Highlighting the character's positive influence on others can portray them as a role model and further solidify their passions and values.

He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli.

Fact 2: Fog is common in the cold air ahead of the front. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"when is fog common?\\" with the following options: - summer end - before thunderstorms - The area was once underwater - dry and hot - It used to be covered by water - never - outer space - under water Answer:","response":"Fog is common before thunderstorms. This can be inferred from the given facts, which state that cold fronts cause thunderstorms as they pass by, and fog is common in the cold air ahead of the front. When a cold front approaches, it displaces warm air, causing the temperature and humidity levels to change. The cooler air near the ground mixes with the warmer, moisture-laden air above it, leading to the formation of fog. Fog is a natural meteorological phenomenon that occurs when water droplets or ice crystals are suspended in the air just above the Earth's surface, causing a reduction in visibility. It is often observed in areas where there are sudden temperature changes, like the transition from land to water or different air masses meeting. Therefore, it is common before thunderstorms when a cold front is moving in, and the environmental conditions are suitable for fog formation. In the context of the provided options: - Summer end: Fog can occur at any time of the year. However, it might be less common at the end of summer as warmer weather patterns would not cool the air as quickly, leading to less likelihood of fog forming before a thunderstorm. - The area was once underwater / It used to be covered by water: While these options might seem relevant because fog is created by the presence of water droplets, they focus more on the geological history of an area than on the meteorological conditions necessary for fog formation. - Dry and hot: Fog is less likely to form under dry and hot conditions, as the warm air would evaporate the moisture required for fog formation. - Never: This option is incorrect, as fog is a common meteorological phenomenon and can occur under specific environmental conditions, such as before thunderstorms. - Outer space: Fog cannot form in outer space due to the lack of atmosphere, air, and moisture needed for fog to form. - Underwater: Fog does not occur underwater. However, the underwater equivalent of fog does exist, known as turbidity, which is the decrease in visibility caused by the presence of suspended particles in the water. In conclusion, given the provided options and the meteorological facts presented, fog is common before thunderstorms when cold fronts approach and create the necessary environmental conditions for fog to form."},{"question":"What country was known to have many amphitheatres?

Good health: Regular exercise and staying active can help lower the risk of developing various health issues like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Exercise helps strengthen your immune system, enabling your body to better fight off diseases. 2. Jogging: This is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise that has numerous benefits for your overall health. Jogging can help improve your heart and lung function, increase endurance, and burn calories to maintain a healthy weight. It also boosts mental health by releasing endorphins - the 'feel-good' hormones. 3. Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy lifestyle and supports your body's natural functions. Exercise not only helps you lose weight, but also improves muscle strength, flexibility, and bone density. Furthermore, it can help in stress management and improve mental well-being. 4. Sweat: Sweating is an essential process for our body, as it plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, especially during exercise. Through sweating, our bodies can release toxins and maintain a healthy balance, ensuring overall good health. 5. Feel better: Regular exercise positively impacts emotional well-being and mental health. As mentioned earlier, physical activity releases endorphins, which naturally elevate mood and help relieve stress, anxiety, and depression.

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal.

A. falling down B. tripping C. death D. lower standards E. slurred speech The best answer is The answer is:","response":"The best answer to the question \\"Getting drunk and using stairs can be dangerous, one might find themselves what? A. falling down B. tripping C. death D. lower standards E. slurred speech\\" is a combination of A. falling down, B. tripping, and C. death. It should be noted that all the options mentioned above can be related to the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, but not all of them are directly associated with using stairs while intoxicated. Here's an elaboration on each option: A. Falling down: When a person is drunk, their coordination and balance are negatively affected. This is due to the depressive effect of alcohol on the central nervous system, which impairs the person's motor skills. Navigating stairs requires a degree of coordination, balance, and physical control, so when a person is drunk, the likelihood of falling down the stairs dramatically increases. B. Tripping: Similar to falling down, tripping on stairs while drunk is a result of impaired motor skills. Alcohol affects the person's judgment, visual acuity, and overall awareness of their surroundings, which contributes to an increased risk of tripping and sustaining injuries. C. Death: While death may seem like an extreme consequence, it cannot be ruled out when it comes to using stairs while drunk. Falling or tripping on stairs can lead to fatal injuries, especially if the person suffers from a significant head injury or falls from a great height. The interaction between alcohol and slippery, uneven, or poorly lit stairs further exacerbates the risk of a fatal accident. D. Lower standards: Lowering one's standards refers to a decreased ability to make sound judgments, often due to intoxication. This can lead to risky or inappropriate behavior that the person may not engage in if they were sober. Although this option relates to the effects of alcohol consumption, it is not directly linked to the dangers of using stairs while intoxicated. E. Slurred speech: Slurred speech is a common symptom of being drunk, as alcohol impairs the communication between the brain and the muscles responsible for speech. While it is a consequence of alcohol consumption, it is not specifically related to the dangers associated with using stairs while intoxicated. In summary, getting drunk and using stairs can be dangerous as it increases the risk of falling down, tripping, and even death due to impaired motor skills, coordination, and judgment caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Options A, B, and C are the most relevant answers to this question, as they directly pertain to the hazards of using stairs while intoxicated."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Drummond Percy Chase - Drummond Percy Chase (September 14 1820 – June 27 1902) was the Principal of St Mary's Hall Oxford.He is most well known for his translation of the Nicomachean Ethics.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by \\"the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on ... legends and fables to the grandchildren\\".They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including The Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's Hammersmith Palais), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany. On October 2, 1985, the group played a concert in Bochum, West Germany, for the German TV show Rockpalast. Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time. Fables of the Reconstruction performed poorly in Europe and its critical reception was mixed, with some critics regarding it as dreary and poorly recorded. As with the previous records, the singles from Fables of the Reconstruction were mostly ignored by mainstream radio. Meanwhile, I.R.S. was becoming frustrated with the band's reluctance to achieve mainstream success.For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp's producer Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, \\"Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice.\\" The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and reached number...

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Q: Passage: Another common myth is that none of the survivors of the Willie or Martin handcart companies ever complained and they never apostatized from the church. The most popular source came from William Palmer, who paraphrased a comment Francis Webster had made in a Sunday School class in Cedar City. He writes: ... did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism? Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the church because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities. This was later quoted by David O. McKay in 1948, and later by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and was taught to children. However, several people in the Willie or Martin handcart companies did leave the church, including John Chislett, John Ahmanson, Elizabeth Sermon, Henry Augustus Squires, Henry Kemp and Deborah Jane Chapman. Many of the survivors complained.Palmer gave the quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know describing the life of Webster about forty years after Webster died. Palmer said that he was paraphrasing Webster, and given the lapse of time and the casual nature of a Sunday School class, Orton believes it unlikely to be an exact quote. Orton believes Palmer was trying to emphasize Webster's character, rather than give a definitive statement on the faithfulness of all the members of the Willie Martin handcart company, and finds it unlikely that it was an exact quote. Orton also finds it unlikely that Webster knew all of the survivors, given that they spread throughout Utah after they arrived and didn't have a reunion until after Webster's death. Orton believes Webster was only referring to the pioneers in Cedar City, where the quote was given. Question: What is the first name of the person who gave a quote during a radio series of Men You Should Know?

When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. I am facing a new situation today: Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","response":"Based on the background article you provided and the information about the two geology students, Bobby would be the student who knew more about seafloor spreading. This is because seafloor spreading is a phenomenon that primarily occurs at divergent tectonic plate boundaries, which is the area of expertise for Bobby. Divergent tectonic plate boundaries are zones where two plates move away from each other due to tensional stress in the lithosphere. At these boundaries, magma from the mantle rises up through fractures and then cools upon reaching the surface, forming new oceanic crust. This process adds new material to the seafloor and causes the plates on either side of the boundary to move apart, resulting in the spreading of the seafloor. Additionally, hydrothermal vents are commonly found at these spreading centers, as well as a variation in the age of rocks depending on their distance from the spreading zone. On the other hand, Nate's area of confidence is convergent plates, which are associated with a different set of phenomena. Convergent plate boundaries are characterized by the collision of tectonic plates, often involving subduction, where one plate is forced under the other and descends into the mantle. This process typically results in the formation of volcanic arcs, earthquakes, and mountain ranges, but is not directly related to seafloor spreading. In summary, Bobby, who is knowledgeable about divergent tectonic plates, would be the student who knew more about seafloor spreading, as this phenomenon is closely associated with the processes occurring at divergent plate boundaries rather than convergent plate boundaries that Nate is specialized in."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

(II). tells us that a black car pulls into the clean driveway, and the people keep shoveling. This makes sense because it continues the story of shoveling. (III). is about a car washing snow off by driving over a puddle, but the story is about the person shoveling, so it's not a great fit. (IV). says a car takes the shovel away, but it doesn't make sense for a car to take a shovel. Cars don't have hands! I think (II) makes the best story.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Can be categorized into several types: These include \\"preppers\\" who stockpile essentials, \\"survivalists\\" who acquire skills for self-sufficiency, \\"sovereign citizens\\" who reject certain laws and taxes, and militiamen who undergo military-style training to resist perceived government threats. 3. Originated in the early 1990s: The Southern Poverty Law Center traces the origins of the modern militia movement back to incidents such as Bill Clinton's election and the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. 4. Saw their membership rise during Democratic presidencies: The context mentions that membership in these groups grew under Bill Clinton, and it implies that growth might have slowed with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support. 5. Are concerned about losing their constitutional rights: Anti-government groups often view the government as a threat to their fundamental rights, such as the right to bear arms. 6. Are sometimes associated with extremist ideologies: Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League research extremism-related activities among these groups.

Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

To make a conclusive statement regarding the preferences or opinions of South Korean musicians about living in South Korea, it would be necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, including interviews, surveys, or studies that cover a more diverse and larger sample of musicians from the country. Only then, we could get closer to understanding their thoughts and sentiments about living in South Korea."},{"question":"Given this review: \\"Nice\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Question: What factor prevents crevasses? Context: The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form. Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs. A:","response":"Step 1: Identify the question. The question is \\"What factor prevents crevasses?\\" Step 2: Examine the context for the answer. The context discusses how crevasses form, as well as the conditions and depth when they form.

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) How did the bully behave after learning the cool trick? - Upset - Impressed - Curious - not enough information A:","response":"The bully behaved Impressed after learning the cool trick."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers. Q: What was the name of the later military organization that the Armée d'Angleterre formed the foundation of?","response":"The Armée d'Angleterre formed the foundation of the later military organization known as La Grande Armée."},{"question":"Traditionally built cob cottage in Dawlish, Devon, collapsed at 4pm yesterday.

The incident, which took place at 4 pm, saw the traditional cob cottage, built in a terraced style, collapse along with the scaffolding adjoining the structure. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the house was empty at the time of the event. The collapse occurred near the town centre, resulting in debris falling into the street, which temporarily disrupted local traffic. This collapse of a tradiational cob-built cottage marks the second such occurrence in Devon within a week. On 4 September, a 400-year-old cob cottage in nearby East Budleigh faced a similar fate. The owner's father, John Timms, and two builders were fortunate enough to escape without injury, having fled just in the nick of time as they heard the cob structure cracking. Recounting the experience, Timms explained, \\"'I heard cracking noises, which became louder, so I got out.\\" The three witnesses watched from a safe distance as the historic property succumbed to the collapse. The incidents have raised concerns around the preservation and maintenance of heritage buildings in the region, especially given that cob construction is revered as a functional, sustainable, and fireproof building material. Cob is a traditional house-building technique commonly used in Devon, which utilises a mix of clay, earth, and straw to create sturdy, durable structures. Dawlish and East Budleigh are not the only places in Devon that showcase this ancient construction technique. Many more historic cob-built cottages still stand proudly across the county, representing architectural gems rich in cultural significance. These recent collapses may serve as a wake-up call for property owners and local authorities to take appropriate measures in ensuring these heritage buildings are well-maintained and structurally sound, to preserve their invaluable legacy for future generations."},{"question":"Question: Does Stantin forget about finding Steve? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Shoot to Kill Context: This article needs an improved plot summary. (May 2015) A man is discovered breaking into his own jewellery shop in the dead of night. Questioned closely, it is discovered that his wife is being held hostage at their home by Steve, a brutal extortionist who demands the diamonds in the shop's safe in exchange for the woman's life. After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver. After a long chase, Stantin manages to shoot Steve in an underwater struggle. The killer's identity is not revealed until midway through the film. He attempts to evade detection by killing a member of a hiking expedition and taking his place. To keep the audience guessing as to the true identity of the villain, some of the hikers were played by actors known for playing bad guys: notably Clancy Brown (Highlander), Frederick Coffin (Mother's Day), Andrew Robinson (Dirty Harry) and Richard Masur (the vicious drug dealer in Who'll Stop the Rain).

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about David's diet from the Bible. David, a significant figure in the Hebrew Bible, Christianity, and Islam, was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Although David is a prophet in Islam, the details about his diet in the Bible are not mentioned in the answer. In the Bible, specific dietary guidelines for David are not explicitly discussed. However, we can infer some aspects of his diet based on the cultural and religious practices during his time. The ancient Israelites followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Based on these dietary laws, the following would likely be components of David's diet: 1. Meats: David would have consumed meat from animals considered \\"clean\\" according to the biblical dietary laws, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. Poultry like chicken, dove, and turkey would also be part of his diet. All meat would have to be prepared according to kosher guidelines, including proper slaughtering and draining of blood. 2. Fish: Fish with fins and scales, such as salmon, trout, and tilapia, would be permitted in David's diet. Shellfish and other non-kosher seafood would not be consumed. 3. Grains: Bread, barley, and wheat were staple grains in the ancient Near East. David would have consumed bread and other grain-based products as a primary source of carbohydrates. 4. Fruits and vegetables: A diet in the ancient Near East would be incomplete without fresh fruits and vegetables. Common produce items included figs, olives, grapes, pomegranates, melons, and cucumbers. 5. Dairy products: Milk, cheese, and yogurt would have been part of David's diet. However, it is essential to note that according to the laws in the Hebrew Bible, dairy products could not be consumed in the same meal as meat. 6. Fats and oils: Olive oil was prevalent in the ancient Near East and was a central cooking ingredient in David's time. It would have been used as a primary source of fat. 7. Legumes and nuts: Almonds, pistachios, lentils, and chickpeas were commonly consumed and would likely be part of David's diet. 8. Spices and herbs: David's diet would have included a variety of seasonings, like cumin, coriander, mint, and dill. 9. Beverages: Water, wine, and vinegar were standard beverages in the Near East. David is known to have drunk wine, as mentioned in the Bible, but it is essential to note that alcohol consumption was generally moderate during his time as cultural values emphasized self-control and discipline. In conclusion, although we cannot provide explicit details about David's diet from the Bible, we can deduce his diet based on the cultural, religious, and historical context of his time. David would have followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible and consumed a diet comprising of various meats, fish, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, legumes, nuts, and beverages permitted by these laws."},{"question":"1). negative; 2). positive; What would be an example of an 2). review?","response":"A positive review, on the other hand, typically focuses on the strengths and positive aspects of a product, service, or experience.

I recently dined at [Restaurant Name] with my family, and I must say that we had an absolutely wonderful evening. From the moment we arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and attentive to our needs. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with soft lighting and comfortable seating, which made us feel right at home. The menu offered a diverse selection of dishes, including vegetarian and gluten-free options that catered to the dietary requirements of our group. We started our meal with a delicious appetizer platter that featured an array of flavors and textures, including crispy spring rolls, creamy spinach and artichoke dip, and zesty bruschetta. The appetizers alone were enough to keep us talking about how great the food was throughout the evening. Our main courses did not disappoint either. I opted for the grilled salmon with a side of roasted vegetables, while my partner chose the house-specialty, prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and were bursting with flavor. The portions were generous without being overwhelming, giving us just the right amount of food to leave us feeling satisfied. The presentation of the dishes was also exquisite, showcasing the restaurant's attention to detail and commitment to providing an upscale dining experience. We were so impressed with our main courses that we couldn't resist trying their decadent dessert selection. We shared a slice of chocolate lava cake that was rich, gooey, and the perfect ending to our meal. The dessert menu was extensive and something tells me that there's still a lot to discover! To top it all off, the owner of [Restaurant Name] even stopped by our table to check in on our experience and offer recommendations for our next visit. This added a personal touch that left us feeling truly valued as customers. In summary, I cannot recommend [Restaurant Name] highly enough for its excellent food, delightful atmosphere, and top-notch service. If you're looking for a truly memorable dining experience, this is the place to go.

However, leaning towards the literal interpretation of \\"punishment,\\" it could be inferred that the review may have a negative connotation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - in cinema - at the park - martorell - jeep - airplane I believe the correct choice is \\"in cinema\\", here's why: Answer:","response":"The correct choice is indeed \\"in cinema.\\" A person taking a seat to watch a movie is most likely situated in a cinema or movie theater. Here's why this is the most logical choice among the options provided: 1. In cinema: Cinemas are specifically designed for screening films, providing comfortable seating, large screens, and high-quality sound systems to create a fully immersive movie-watching experience. Therefore, when a person takes a seat to watch a movie, it's highly plausible that they are in a cinema. 2. At the park: While it's possible for outdoor movie screenings to take place at parks, this scenario is relatively less common compared to a traditional cinema. Parks are more often associated with recreational activities, sports, and picnics rather than movie-watching. Thus, the likelihood of the person being at a park is lower than them being in a cinema. 3. Martorell: Martorell is a municipality in Catalonia, Spain. It doesn't refer to a specific place where people watch movies. Therefore, this option isn't indicative of the location the person might be in when watching a movie. 4. Jeep: A jeep is a type of vehicle designed for off-road driving and other rugged activities. Although some people may watch movies using portable screens in various vehicles, it's unlikely that someone would specifically take a seat in a jeep to watch a movie as the main purpose of the vehicle is transportation. Thus, this option is less probable than \\"in cinema.\\" 5. Airplane: While airplanes often provide in-flight entertainment systems that include movies, the primary purpose of taking a seat on an airplane is to travel. Watching a movie is simply an additional activity passengers may choose to engage in during flights. Hence, statistically, a person taking a seat to watch a movie is more likely to be in a cinema than on an airplane. In conclusion, the most logical choice among the given options for a person taking a seat to watch a movie is \\"in cinema,\\" as it's the most common and natural setting for movie-watching experiences."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. \\"We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\\" Dane says. \\"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\\" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \\"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\\" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. \\"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\\" he says. Question: We can learn from the passage _ . Options: A: the ferry sails at a speed of 7.5 kilometers an hour B: the ferry is good for the environment C: four sources of energy for the ferry are controlled by Dane D: solar energy needn't be stored in case of good weather Answer:","response":"B: the ferry is good for the environment"},{"question":"Question: How does Amy communicate with humans? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Congo Context: While testing a communications laser in a remote part of the Congo jungle, TraviCom employees Charles Travis (Bruce Campbell) and Jeffrey Weems (Taylor Nichols) discover the ruins of a lost city near a volcanic site. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera at the camp, discovering the camp destroyed and numerous corpses; something large suddenly knocks over and destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker), who informs her that the group was really there looking for a rare blue diamond only found there which would greatly enhance their capabilities, but does not offer any hope to rescue them. Travis implores Karen to lead an expedition and she makes Travis swear that he is sending her to look for Charles, not the diamond. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Elliott (Dylan Walsh), a primatologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his assistant Richard (Grant Heslov) teach human communication to primates using a gorilla named Amy (voiced by Shayna Fox). With a special backpack and glove, her sign language is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned that Amy is having nightmares and psychological problems, due to several drawings Amy has made of jungles and the Eye of Providence. Peter attempts to gain funding to take Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant, and Peter begins inquiring elsewhere. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) offers to fund the expedition; Karen, having learned of the trip, offers to fund it as well and to come along, hoping to discover the fate of her team. In Africa, the group meets their expert guide Captain Munro Kelly (Ernie Hudson) but they are captured by the local authorities and militia leader named Captain Wanta (Delroy Lindo) who grants them passage for a sizable bribe. As the group boards another plane, Munro reveals that Homolka has led previous safaris in search of the \\"Lost City of... A:","response":"In the movie Congo, Amy the gorilla communicates with humans using sign language. Dr. Peter Elliott and his assistant Richard teach her human communication through sign language. To facilitate better communication and make her signing understandable to a wider audience, they use a special backpack and glove that translates Amy's sign language into a digitized voice. This technology allows humans to understand what Amy is trying to communicate directly, without needing to know sign language themselves."},{"question":"Choose your story that continues the following story. The fitness instructor told me to eat more oats instead of meats because the (i). oats are healthier.. (ii). meats are healthier..","response":"I'll choose to continue with the story where the fitness instructor says that oats are healthier. Here's the story: The fitness instructor told me to eat more oats instead of meats because oats are healthier. I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the suggestion, but I decided to give it a shot. After all, she was the expert, and my goal was to become fitter and healthier. As she explained, oats are a great source of nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can contribute to a balanced and nutritious diet. I was hesitant at first because I had always been a meat-lover, but I reminded myself of my objective - to improve my overall health. Step 1: Research the health benefits of oats To begin with, I started doing some research on my own to understand the health benefits of oats and how they compare to different types of meats. This helped me to gain a deeper appreciation of her recommendation. Step 2: Find oat-based recipes Next, I searched for various oat-based recipes to include in my meals. This was necessary because I wanted to diversify and enjoy my diet, even if it meant cutting back on meat. Step 3: Monitor the transition As I started to incorporate more oats into my daily meals, I carefully observed how my body responded to the changes. I kept track of my energy levels, digestion, and overall sense of well-being. Step 4: Share my experience My friends and family noticed my shift toward a more plant-based diet and became curious about my reasons. I shared what I had learned from my fitness instructor and my personal experience. Step 5: Adjust as needed While I primarily focused on incorporating oats into my diet, I also allowed myself to enjoy meats on occasion. This helped me maintain a balance and ensure that I wasn't depriving myself of the foods I loved. In conclusion, by following my fitness instructor's advice to eat more oats instead of meats, I embarked on a journey toward healthier eating habits. This not only contributed positively to my physical well-being but also allowed me to inspire people around me."},{"question":"Write a negative tweet.

They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. But I can use this background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. What is an answer for this question: Which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction? A:","response":"Based on the information provided, Andy, who studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes, would likely have learned less about sulfate reduction as compared to Bob. Bob studies nitrogen-fixating bacteria, which are more directly related to the ecologically important processes like denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis. While Andy's research subjects might be indirectly related to these processes, their primary focus is on fermentation and switching between different terminal electron acceptors based on environmental conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bob has more exposure to and understanding of sulfate reduction in his research compared to Andy."},{"question":"Add punctuation: It alleges that a member of the IT team told Navman of a potential gap in its system compared to its incumbent which could be a showstopper","response":"It alleges that a member of the IT team told Navman of a potential gap in its system compared to its incumbent, which could be a showstopper."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question having multiple possible answers in Japanese language.

Article: One of Britain's bravest women told yesterday how she helped to catch suspected police killer David Bieber --- and was thanked with flowers by the police. It was also said that she could be in line for a share of up to PS30,000 reward money . Vicki Brown , 30 , played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt . Vicki , who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years , told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building. She said : \\" I was very nervous . But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park I was so glad they were there.\\" The alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 8 pm the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said : \\" He didn't seem to want to talk too much and make any eye contact.\\" Vicki, the only employee on duty , called her boss Margaret , 64 , and husband Stan McKale, 65 , who phoned the police at 11 pm. Officers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston , Gateshead , at about 11:30 pm to make sure that this was the wanted man . Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes. \\" It was about ten to two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said ' Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside ?' My heart missed a beat .\\" Vicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key. \\" I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that part of the hotel , so I went to watch . I could not see into the man's room , but I could see the passage . The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing . Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed .\\" Question: How long did the whole event probably last from the moment Bieber came to the hotel to the arrival of some armed officers ? Options: A: About 6. B: About 8. C: About 11. D: About 14 Answer:","response":"C: About 11 To determine how long the event lasted from the moment Bieber arrived at the hotel to the arrival of some armed officers, we need to examine the given information in the article. 1. Bieber checked into the hotel at 8 pm the day before New Year's Eve. 2. Vicki called her boss, Margaret, and her husband, Stan, at an unspecified time. 3. Margaret and Stan contacted the police at 11 pm. 4. Northumbria Police called Vicki at approximately 11:30 pm. 5. Finally, the armed officers arrived at about 1:50 am (ten to two in the morning). To calculate the duration of the event, we should primarily focus on the times Bieber checked in (8 pm) and when the armed officers requested Vicki to make herself known to them (1:50 am). To do this calculation, follow these steps: 1. Convert the given time to a 24-hour format: 8 pm → 20:00, and 1:50 am → 1:50. 2. Calculate the difference between the two times: 1:50 - 20:00 → 5 hours and 50 minutes. 3. Round the result to the nearest hour: 5 hours and 50 minutes ≈ 6 hours. However, recalling that Vicki called her boss at an unspecified time, it is safe to assume that this call, as well as her suspicions, took some time before they contacted the police at 11 pm. To account for this time, approximately 5 hours should be added to the calculated duration. Therefore, the whole event likely lasted for about 11 hours, which corresponds to option C."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Evangelica was a magazine started in 1980 following the controversial dismissal of Seventh-day Adventist theologian Desmond Ford. It was published until 1987, and had an \\"Evangelical Adventist\\" perspective. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Evangelical and Reformed Church (E&R) was a Protestant Christian denomination in the United States. It was formed in 1934 by the merger of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) with the Evangelical Synod of North America (ESNA). A minority within the RCUS remained out of the merger in order to continue the name Reformed Church in the United States. In 1957, the Evangelical and Reformed Church merged with the majority of the Congregational Christian Churches (CC) to form the United Church of Christ (UCC). - Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African-American residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on spacious grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east.

He was the first African American minister to lead this multicultural congregation , and served it for 18 years . - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - The United Church of Christ (UCC) is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination, with historical confessional roots in the Reformed, Congregational and Evangelical traditions, and \\"with over 5,000 churches and nearly one million members\\". The United Church of Christ is in historical continuation of the General Council of Congregational Christian churches founded under the influence of New England Puritanism. The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Christian, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. At the end of 2014, the UCC's 5,116 congregations claimed 979,239 members, primarily in the United States. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 0.4 percent, or 1 million adult adherents, of the U.S population self-identify with the United Church of Christ. - Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace. The borough is coextensive with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York.

How do animals defend themselves? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"While both questions discuss the concept of animal defense mechanisms, the first question specifically asks for \\"really cool ways\\" animals defend themselves, indicating an emphasis on unique or intriguing methods. The second question is broader, inquiring about animal defense mechanisms in general. We can explore several fascinating and cool ways animals defend themselves below. 1. Camouflage: Many animals, such as chameleons, leaf-tailed geckos, and certain insects, can blend in with their environment using camouflage. They either change their color to match their surroundings, avoiding detection by predators, or adopt shapes and patterns that resemble objects such as leaves and sticks to remain unnoticed. 2. Mimicry: Some animals use mimicry as a defense mechanism by imitating the appearance, behavior, or sound of another species. The harmless milk snake, for example, closely resembles the venomous coral snake, deterring potential predators from attacking. 3. Chemical Defense: Several animals produce noxious or toxic substances to ward off or harm their predators. The bombardier beetle releases a heated chemical spray when threatened, and certain species of millipedes emit toxic, foul-smelling chemicals to ward off their enemies. Similarly, some amphibians, like poison dart frogs, secrete toxic alkaloids through their skin to protect themselves. 4. Startle Displays: Many creatures use startle displays to momentarily confuse or disorient their predators. The owl butterfly, for instance, has large eyespots on its wings that resemble the eyes of a predator, which can intimidate and deter potential threats. The common hognose snake imitates the appearance and behavior of a venomous snake while flattening its head and hissing, causing predators to think twice before attacking. 5. Armor and Spines: Some animals have developed hard, external armors or sharp spines to deter potential attackers. Turtles and tortoises, for example, possess robust, protective shells that protect their vulnerable bodies, while porcupines possess sharp quills that can inflict serious injury to predators that come into contact with them. 6. Group Defense: Certain species have developed advanced social behaviors to defend themselves collectively. Meerkats, for instance, post sentinels to watch for predators while the rest forage for food. Similarly, musk oxen form a tight circle around their young when under threat, presenting an impenetrable barrier of solid muscle and sharp horns. 7. Autotomy: Some animals can shed part of their body in a process known as autotomy to escape from predators. Lizards are known for losing their tails when caught, with the tail continuing to wriggle, distracting the predator, while the lizard flees to safety. Sea cucumbers can eject internal organs when threatened, confusing their predators and allowing them to regrow the lost organs later. 8. Stotting: This behavior, observed in animals like gazelles and springboks, involves the prey animal displaying rapid, high jumps with stiff legs and an arched back when a predator is nearby. This signals to the predator that the prey is fit and healthy, possibly discouraging pursuit due to the likelihood of a challenging chase. In summary, the questions are similar in that they both explore animal defense mechanisms. However, the first question emphasizes the unique and intriguing defense methods, while the second question is more general in its scope."},{"question":"Q: Title: Disappointed Review: This is probably one of the worst Ralphie May DVDs out.

Firstly, the reviewer identifies themselves as a devoted fan of Ralphie May, thereby implying that their expectations for the DVD were high and unfortunately not met. They even go so far as to label it \\"one of the worst Ralphie May DVDs out.\\" Such statements clearly indicate a negative outlook. Secondly, the reviewer feels that the DVD's content is largely unoriginal, noting that the \\"majority of the jokes are from the Iraq tour video,\\" a feature found on another of Ralphie's DVDs, 'Just Correct'. They find this repetition disappointing, offering the opinion that a consumer's money would be better spent on the 'Just Correct' DVD rather than this one. Moreover, the reviewer criticizes Ralphie for his altered comedic style in this particular performance, suggesting that his toned-down language and use of politically correct terms, presumably in effort to appeal to the culture and norms of Tennessee (where it was filmed), are atypical and, in their opinion, detract from his routine. This is underscored by the reviewer's disapproval of Ralphie's attempt to use a fake Nashville accent, which they found to be \\"very bad.\\" These factors combine to form a review that portrays the product – Ralphie May's DVD – in a decidedly negative light. The user wouldn't recommend others to buy it, which is a clear indication of dissatisfaction and disappointment in the product."},{"question":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I've been using this shredder for a year now and while I love the way it can turn any paper into dust, the fact that it can only handle a few pages at a time has been driving me crazy. First the good- it's large, has a huge pull-out bin, and shreds paper into nothingness. The bad- this thing is a total baby when it comes to shredding more than 3-4 pieces of paper. I've tried heavy and light paper and regardless, the sensor on this unit refuses to go over 5 pages most days. The box is completely misleading when it says 10-sheet and the majority of the time you can only send a few. I've spent countless amount of time feeding and re-feeding the shredder.I really want to love this shredder but one year later I'm sick of it.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam captained Pakistan in thirty Tests, winning eleven, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win-loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. Although the Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place and had it not occurred, Inzamam's record would have had a win more and a loss less. However, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992, when Imran Khan retired. Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick's Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him 'The Bob'.","response":"This text is about Inzamam-ul-Haq, also known as Inzy, a former Pakistani cricketer and former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team."},{"question":"Premise: But Kyoto has nevertheless remained the repository of the nation's noblest cultural pursuits and architectural legacy.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely. Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Answer:","response":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen than Iron Bar B. This is because Iron Bar A was left outside on the porch on a rainy day, which means it was in direct contact with water and the oxygen present in the air. In contrast, Iron Bar B was placed in an airtight bag, and all the oxygen and air were removed to vacuum seal it. This means that Iron Bar B was isolated from water and oxygen, preventing it from rusting. The rusting process, which is an example of corrosion, requires the presence of both water and oxygen to occur, as described in the hint. Thus, Iron Bar A experienced more rusting due to its exposure to a higher amount of water and oxygen compared to Iron Bar B."},{"question":"Q: You are given a sentence in English.

Considered the \\"father of tubular designs\\" for high-rises, Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center. Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century. Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \\"tube\\" structural system for tall buildings, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants. His \\"tube concept\\", using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles. Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems. They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects. These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years. The tubular systems have yet to reach their limit when it comes to height. Another important feature of the tubular systems is that buildings can be constructed using steel or reinforced concrete, or a composite of the two, to reach greater heights. Khan pioneered the use of lightweight concrete for high-rise buildings, at a time when reinforced concrete was used for mostly low-rise construction of only a few stories in height. Most of Khan's designs were conceived considering pre-fabrication and repetition of components so projects could be quickly built with minimal errors. The population explosion, starting with the baby boom of the 1950s, created widespread concern about the amount of available living space, which Khan solved by building upward. More than any other 20th-century engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan made it possible for people to live and work in \\"cities in the sky.\\" Mark Sarkisian (Director of Structural and Seismic Engineering at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) said, \\"Khan was a visionary who transformed skyscrapers into sky cities while staying firmly grounded in the fundamentals of engineering.\\" Ask a question about this article.","response":"What is the \\"tube\\" structural system that Fazlur Rahman Khan introduced, and how did it revolutionize skyscraper design and construction?"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which film was released first, Triumph of the Will or Voices of Iraq?

By Deni Kirkova PUBLISHED: 10:54 EST, 17 November 2013 | UPDATED: 10:56 EST, 17 November 2013 You're likely to be rated as more attractive when pictured in a group than when alone, according to new research. Being pictured with friends could boost your perceived attractiveness as people tend to 'average out' everyone's facial features when looking at group photos. Observers perceive each individual's face as more average than they would otherwise - and average faces are deemed more attractive. The phenomenon is dubbed the 'cheerleader effect'. Tulisa shows her support to Little Mix by attending their gig at G-A-Y earlier this month 'Average faces are more attractive, likely due to the averaging out of unattractive idiosyncrasies,' says","response":"Dr. Drew Walker, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the study. The research involved several experiments in which participants rated the attractiveness of people in photographs - both in group settings and as individuals. Consistently, participants found the individuals to be more attractive when they were part of a group. In light of these findings, people may start to rethink their social media strategies - perhaps prioritizing group photos over selfies to improve their online attractiveness. Dr. Walker suggests that being seen in a group setting, whether it's online or in person, could have practical benefits when it comes to dating, networking, or even job hunting. While it might seem counterintuitive to make one's own face less distinctive in order to appear more attractive, the cheerleader effect proves that sometimes, blending in works to our advantage. The effect reveals the power of context in shaping our perceptions of attractiveness and provides a simple strategy for those looking to put their best face forward. And so, the story comes to an enlightening end, as the cheerleader effect gains popularity not just among scientists but in the wider public as well. As more people become aware of the phenomenon, they begin incorporating it into their lives - helping everyone present their most appealing selves to the world."},{"question":"News article: Mini guide to art in Berlin The Berlin sculpture with a view of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. (John Freeman/LPI/Getty) Like New York and London in the '70s and '80s, Berlin’s cheap rents and anything-goes ethos have made it a hub for international artists, creating a city of restless energy and optimism. East and North The Berlin Wall used to run right through Mauerpark, now a focus for street art. Graffiti artists are given free rein on a 300m stretch of wall that remains. Their work is ever changing, sometimes politically minded, but always thrillingly cutting-edge. The park is also home to flea markets and barbecues (btw Bernauer Strasse, Schwedter Strasse & Gleimstrasse; admission free). A converted margarine factory now home to the Berlin Biennale, the KW Institute for Contemporary Art is a lab for current developments in art, with recent exhibitions featuring the work of Martin Neumaier, Nina Rhode, Helen Mirra, Sean Snyder and Ayzit Bostan (Auguststrasse 69; closed Mon; admission £4.80). While you’re there, check out Me Collectors Room at Auguststrasse 68 – one of the newest kids on Berlin’s art block. Founded a decade after the fall of the Wall in 1989 and based in an underground apartment since 2002, the Galerie Kurt Im Hirsch is one of Berlin’s few not-for-profit gallery spaces. Regularly updated exhibitions feature the work of local artists as well as international big hitters. Lately the gallery has exhibited sculptural installations by Istanbul’s Haluk Atalayman (Kastanienallee 12; open Fri–Sun; admission free). Centre The Akademie Der Kunste is one of the city’s oldest cultural institutions, founded in 1696 as the Prussian Academy of Arts. Come here for readings, workshops and exhibits: recent showcases have focused on German abstract photographer Heinz Hajek-Halke and Berlin political art activist John Heartfield (Pariser Platz 4; some exhibitions free). The Sammlung Boros is a former Nazi bunker that has been transformed into a beacon of contemporary art by advertising guru Christian Boros. Its maze of concrete and stark white walls makes for the perfect backdrop for the works of artists, such as Olafur Eliasson, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas and Wolfgang Tillmans. Booking online for its 90-minute tours is essential (Reinhardtstrasse 20; admission £8; tours Fri–Sun). The Hamburger Bahnhof is a converted 19th-century train station and an eye-catching museum space for art from 1960 onwards. On display you’ll find career-spanning bodies of work from US Pop Art pioneers Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, and Germany’s multi-talented 1970s figures Anselm Kiefer and Joseph Beuys (Invalidenstrasse 50–51; admission £9.50; closed Mon). West and south The Berlinische Galerie is a whitewashed hall, in a converted glass warehouse around the corner from the Jewish Museum and is a superb spot to take stock of the local scene from 1870 to the present day, including artists of the Weimar period such as Otto Dix and George Grosz (Alte Jakobstrasse 124–128; admission £6; closed Tue). Part of the enormous cultural complex of the Kulturforum, the custom-built Gemäldegalerie reunites about 1,500 works spanning European art history from the 13th to the 18th centuries, after half a century of Cold War separation. Look out for masterpieces by the likes of Rembrandt, Dürer, Hals, Holbein and Vermeer (Matthäikirchplatz; admission £6; closed Mon). The ATM Gallery showcases art works in city environments – street art taken from the street to the gallery, essentially. Exhibitions of international urban art and Berlin-based collectives are changed monthly – recent ones include Various & Gould’s Dadaist, painterly murals and Emess’s neon Pop Art-inspired portraits of selected dignitaries (Eylauerstrasse 13; admission free by appointment). Where to stay The friendly East Seven Hostel in Prenzlauer Berg has brightly coloured private rooms with comfy pine-wood beds, and a great outdoor barbecue space in a pretty back garden (Schwedterstrasse 7; private rooms from £35). If you fancy sleeping with an original work of art, check into Scheunenviertel’s Mitart Hotel & Café, whose rooms are decorated with changing canvasses from up-and-coming Berlin artists (Linienstrasse 139–140; from £90). The Adlon Kempinski has been Berlin’s defender of grand tradition since 1907. Its striking lobby is merely a taster for the full splendour of its guestrooms and suites and five gourmet restaurants (Unter den Linden 77; from £240). TransportBerlin Tegel airport is the main international hub, while low-cost airlines mostly use the smaller Schönefeld airport. Both are expected to close in October 2013 with the opening of the new Berlin Brandenburg airport. Berlin is served from the UK by Air Berlin, BA, easyJet, Lufthansa and Ryanair (from £80). The JetExpressBus TXL takes 28–40 minutes to reach the centre from Tegel (singles £1.90). From Schönefeld, AirportExpress trains call at several central locations – it takes 21 minutes to reach Alexanderplatz (from £2.40).

Which U.S. state has borders with Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana?","response":"Ohio is the U.S. state that shares its borders with Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana. Located in the Great Lakes region of the United States, Ohio is the 34th largest state by area and the 7th most populous state in the country. To provide a comprehensive understanding of Ohio's borders with these five states, let's delve deeper into their geographic layout and intersections: 1. Michigan: Ohio shares its northern border with Michigan. The boundary between the two states stretches for approximately 197 miles (317 kilometers) in length and incorporates both land and water borders. The most significant water border is established by Lake Erie, which occupies a considerable portion of Ohio's northern boundary. 2. Pennsylvania: The eastern border of Ohio meets the western border of Pennsylvania. The boundary between these two states is relatively short, extending a mere 46.5 miles (74.8 kilometers). The principal landmark determining this border is the Ohio River, which flows along the southern boundary of Ohio and separates it from West Virginia before making a northwest turn to form the boundary with Pennsylvania. 3. West Virginia: Southeast of Ohio lies West Virginia. This border is formed mainly by the Ohio River, which meanders for approximately 277 miles (446 kilometers) along the shared boundary of these two states. Along this border, the Ohio River separates the rugged Appalachian region of West Virginia from the rolling plains of Ohio. 4. Kentucky: Ohio's southern border with Kentucky also traverses the Ohio River. This water boundary stretches for about 137 miles (220 kilometers), bringing the total of river-formed borders between Ohio and its adjacent states to more than 460 miles (740 kilometers). The Ohio River serves as a significant transportation, commerce, and recreation corridor for both Ohio and Kentucky, with multiple bustling cities and harbors located along its banks. 5. Indiana: To the west of Ohio lies Indiana. The border between these two states extends approximately 171 miles (275 kilometers) and runs in a relatively straight, north-south direction. The boundary was initially determined in 1787 by the Northwest Ordinance, which also established the foundation for the formation and governance of the states within the Northwest Territory. The western border of Ohio and Indiana is noteworthy for its rural, agricultural landscapes and small towns, as well as for the intersecting roads and highways that facilitate interstate travel. In summary, Ohio, the Buckeye State, shares its borders with five other U.S. states – Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana. These borders shape the geographic, economic, and cultural characteristics of Ohio and its neighboring states, through interconnected transportation corridors, waterways, and regional affiliations."},{"question":"Translate the following.

Indicate each answer with its index ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'). Input: Coating is non-reactive and lasts at least ____ times as long as filament sources.Question: Choose the right answer from options given a) ten b) eight c) one d) zero Output:","response":"Part #1: Identify the sentence with the missing word Usage: The sentence given here is \\"Coating is non-reactive and lasts at least ____ times as long as filament sources.\\" From this sentence, we can identify the blank where a word is missing. The missing word is the one we'll need to fill in using one of the multiple choice options. Part #2: Understand the context of the sentence Usage: After identifying the sentence and the missing word, we must understand what the sentence is saying - to understand the context and the topic of the sentence. The sentence \\"Coating is non-reactive and lasts at least ____ times as long as filament sources.\\" talks about the lasting time or durability of a non-reactive coating in comparison to 'filament sources'. Hence, we need a word that would make sense within this specific context. Part #3: Look at each answer option Usage: The options given are a) ten, b) eight, c) one, d) zero. We need to assess each option and decide which one correctly fills the blank. In this case, we are talking about something that is longer than another. So logically, it can't be 'zero' and since it's being compared as longer than the filament sources it can't be 'one'. So it's either 'ten' or 'eight'. Part #4: Choose the best option that fills the blank Usage: Determining the 'best' answer requires judgement and depends on the specific context of the sentence. Here, without any further information either 'ten' or 'eight' could fit but 'ten' is more likely to be used in this kind of comparison so the answer would be a) ten. This is the best choice because this number is often used in comparative phrases like 'ten times more', 'ten times as much', etc., which suggests that the coating lasts significantly longer than the filament sources. Part #5: Indicate the answer with its index Usage: Indicate the answer with its index as per the instruction given. Here, the index of the chosen answer 'ten' is 'a'. Therefore, we indicate the answer as 'a'."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many more adults were obese in 2000 than in 1990, in percentage?","response":"Title: The Rise in Adult Obesity Rates: A Comparison of Percentages from 1990 to 2000 Introduction Obesity, described as excessive or abnormal fat formation in the body, is not only a pressing health issue but also a matter of socio-economic concern. Over the years, obesity rates have alarmingly risen across age groups, particularly among adults. In this article, we will delve into the percentage increase in adult obesity rates in the United States between the years 1990 and 2000, focusing on the factors that caused this shift and its implications for public health policies. Obesity Trends between 1990 and 2000 To understand the percentage increase in adult obesity between these years, reliable data sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) must be considered. According to the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the prevalence of obesity among US adults (20 years and older) in 1990 was 11.1%. By 2000, this number had nearly doubled, reaching 20.1%. This translates to an 8-percentage-point increase or a 72.1% relative increase, indicating a significant rise in obesity rates within just a decade. Factors Contributing to the Rise in Obesity Rates Several factors have contributed to the upsurge in obesity rates among adults during this period. Some of these factors include: 1. Dietary changes: The consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods - particularly those high in calories, sugars, and saturated fats - has increased significantly. The availability of highly processed, less healthy food options has contributed to this change. 2. Decreased physical activity: Sedentary lifestyles have become more common due to the prevalence of office jobs, increased screen time, and decreased opportunities to engage in physical activity. This has led to an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, contributing to obesity. 3. Socioeconomic factors: Income levels, education, and occupation can impact an individual's food choices and access to healthy options. Research shows that individuals with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to consume energy-dense foods and have less access to fresh fruits, vegetables, and other nutrient-rich options that can help maintain a healthy weight. 4. Genetic and biological factors: Family history, genetics, and metabolism can play a role in obesity. Some individuals may be predisposed to obesity due to genetic factors or hormonal imbalances that affect energy expenditure. 5. Cultural and environmental factors: In some communities, cultural practices and food preferences may lead to increased consumption of high-calorie foods or reduced physical activity. Additionally, the built environment, such as living in neighborhoods with fewer opportunities for safe physical activity, can exacerbate obesity rates. Implications and Public Health Policies The rising trend in adult obesity rates between 1990 and 2000 has had profound implications for public health policies. This increase has placed a significant burden on the healthcare system in terms of managing obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and several forms of cancer. As a result, public health experts have called for comprehensive obesity prevention and management strategies. These strategies include the following: 1. Nutrition education and promotion of healthy food choices: Governments, schools, and workplaces should work to provide nutrition education and encourage individuals to make healthier dietary choices. This can involve promoting fruits and vegetables as well as reducing the consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. 2. Increasing opportunities for physical activity: Policies aimed at improving the built environment, such as creating safe walkways, bike lanes, parks, and accessible exercise facilities, can enhance opportunities for individuals to engage in regular physical activities. 3. Socioeconomic interventions: Through education, income supplementation, and other social programs, governments and organizations can provide lower-income people with better access to healthier and more affordable food options. Conclusion The decade between 1990 and 2000 witnessed a striking percentage increase in adult obesity rates within the United States, attributable to multiple factors, including dietary changes, sedentary lifestyles, and socioeconomic disparities. Acknowledging this increase calls for the implementation of robust, targeted public health policies and programs that aim to prevent and manage obesity in the long run. These interventions should emphasize improved nutrition, increased physical activity, and socioeconomic supports in order to create a healthier population."},{"question":"If \\"Muzzled greyhounds are racing along a dog track.\\" does that mean that \\"The dogs are outside running in a circle.\\"?

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition.

More than 100 of them today signed a letter praising the reform bill coming to the Senate floor, saying it would have a \\"positive impact on population growth, labor force growth, housing, and other markets,\\" the LA Times reports. They cited the Congressional Budget Office's assertion that such a bill would increase average economic growth by 0.1% over the next decade, and trim 300 billion off the federal budget deficit. But even as the economists are providing political cover, many of the Republican senators the Gang of Eight was counting on to back the bill are balking, Politico reports. They want to see changes like more border security and tougher citizenship requirements. But Democrats feel they've given too much ground already, and aren't eager to compromise. And because no one's sure how to get the bill through the House—Politico has another piece on the difficulties Democratic Caucus Chair Xavier Becerra is having with it there—the Gang was hoping to amass overwhelming Senate support to exert pressure. \\"Our goal is to get 70 votes,\\" Chuck Schumer says. \\"It's going to take a lot of work.\\" Article:","response":"Title: Over 100 Conservative Economists Endorse GOP's Immigration Reform Bill Amidst Internal Debate More than 100 conservative economists have come forward to publicly endorse the GOP's immigration reform bill set to come before the Senate floor, as reported by the LA Times. While some prominent Republican senators are hesitant to back the bill without additional amendments, the support from these economists indicates a shift in the party's approach to immigration policy. With potential benefits such as increased population growth, labor force growth, and impacts on housing and other markets, the economists believe that passing the bill would better serve American interests. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed bill could increase average economic growth by 0.1% within the next decade, while potentially reducing the federal budget deficit by 300 billion. Such figures underscore the necessity for bipartisan support, even though some Republican senators are requesting further changes, including stricter border security and more rigorous citizenship requirements. Despite the initial support from the Gang of Eight, some Republican senators are reluctant to back the bill without including the desired amendments. Conversely, Democrats in the Senate feel that they have already made significant concessions in the legislation and that further compromise could weaken the bill's long-term impact. As the bill's future remains uncertain in the House, Democratic Caucus Chair Xavier Becerra is struggling to find solid support for the legislation. The Gang of Eight, comprised of both Democrat and Republican senators, had hoped for an overwhelming show of support in the Senate, providing momentum and pressure for the bill to move swiftly through the House. Senator Chuck Schumer, a member of the Gang of Eight, stated, \\"Our goal is to get 70 votes. It's going to take a lot of work.\\" Despite internal disagreement, the economists' endorsement serves as an important step towards making the immigration reform bill a priority for the Republican party. Not only does it signal a shift from traditional Republican stances on immigration, but it also highlights the potential economic benefits of implementing a reform that allows for an influx of new talent and contributes to overall economic growth. In light of the economists' support, it is essential for the Senate to engage in constructive discussions and work towards drafting an immigration bill that would benefit the nation as a whole. By acknowledging the potential economic benefits, as well as addressing the concerns surrounding the proposed legislation, Senators from both sides of the aisle must strive to find a consensus that ensures the bill's success and underpins America's economic development. In conclusion, the endorsement by over 100 conservative economists of the GOP's immigration reform bill marks a significant change in how the party approaches immigration policy. With potential economic benefits and necessary compromise from both Republicans and Democrats, it is crucial that the bill be thoroughly debated and amended to best serve America's interests. Despite internal divisions, this display of support signifies that consensus may still be possible, ultimately leading to the creation of legislation that will ensure the continued growth and development of the nation."},{"question":"Write an incorrect answer to the given question based on the associated fact.

In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.

While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Context: Meg Greenfield, editorial page editor for The Washington Post who edited Krauthammer's columns for 15 years, called his weekly column \\"independent and hard to peg politically. It's a very tough column. There's no 'trendy' in it. You never know what is going to happen next.\\" Hendrik Hertzberg, also a former colleague of Krauthammer while they worked at The New Republic in the 1980s, said that when the two first met in 1978, Krauthammer was \\"70 percent Mondale liberal, 30 percent 'Scoop Jackson Democrat,' that is, hard-line on Israel and relations with the Soviet Union\\"; in the mid-1980s, he was still \\"50-50: fairly liberal on economic and social questions but a full-bore foreign-policy neoconservative.\\" Hertzberg now calls Krauthammer a \\"pretty solid 90-10 Republican.\\" Krauthammer has been described by some as a conservative. Krauthammer's major monograph on foreign policy, \\"Democratic Realism: An American Foreign Policy for a Unipolar World,\\" is critical both of the neoconservative Bush doctrine for being too expansive and utopian, and of foreign policy \\"realism\\" for being too narrow and immoral; instead, he proposes an alternative he calls \\"Democratic Realism.\\" In a 2005 speech (later published in Commentary Magazine) he called neoconservatism \\"a governing ideology whose time has come.\\" He noted that the original \\"fathers of neoconservatism\\" were \\"former liberals or leftists.\\" More recently, they have been joined by \\"realists, newly mugged by reality\\" such as Condoleezza Rice, Richard Cheney, and George W. Bush, who \\"have given weight to neoconservatism, making it more diverse and, given the newcomers' past experience, more mature.\\" In \\"Charlie Gibson's Gaffe\\" in The Washington Post, September 13, 2008, Krauthammer elaborated on the changing meanings of the Bush Doctrine in light of Gibson's questioning of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin regarding what exactly the Bush Doctrine was, which resulted in criticism of Palin's response. Krauthammer states that the phrase originally referred to \\"the unilateralism that characterized the pre-9/11 first year of the Bush administration,\\" but elaborates, \\"There is no single meaning of the Bush doctrine. In fact, there have been four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of this administration.\\" Krauthammer refused to vote for Donald Trump, and believes there is evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","response":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article. Charles Krauthammer was a very talented person who became a successful writer, political commentator, and doctor, even after a severe accident left him paralyzed from the neck down.

People found it hard to predict his opinions because they were independent and didn't fit easily into a political category.

Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike. They end up in a rural area, where the car rolls off a cliff and catches fire. If that were not enough, they get arrested several times by the local police, first for catching a ride in a truck carrying illegal Mexican immigrants.

Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that there are successive waves of Norman invaders following Strongbow. This indicates that there were multiple groups of Norman invaders that arrived after Strongbow. However, the premise does not mention any specific timeline or duration regarding this event. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that these waves of Norman invaders occurred for two weeks. This is a specific timeframe being proposed about the same event mentioned in the premise. Step 3: Analyze the connection between the premise and the hypothesis In this step, we need to see if the premise provides enough information to support the hypothesis. The premise tells us that there were successive waves of Norman invaders, but it does not specify any timeframe or duration.

The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone.

Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"Step 1: Identify the cost for the black and white drawing The cost of the black and white drawing is given as 160. Step 2: Calculate the extra cost for coloring Since the color drawing is 50% more expensive than the black and white drawing, we need to find 50% of 160. To do this, we multiply 160 by 0.50: 160 * 0.50 = 80 Step 3: Add the extra cost to the base cost Now we need to add the additional cost for the coloring to the base cost of the black and white drawing. This will give us the total cost of the colored drawing: 160 (base cost) + 80 (additional cost) = 240 So, John paid 240 for the 9 by 13 color drawing."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects. Which lake had a lower net productivity? Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]","response":"Based on the information provided, Long lake had a lower net productivity. The higher occurrence of water stratification in Long lake led to more barriers to nutrient mixing, limiting photosynthetic processes and primary production. This, in turn, resulted in a decrease in the fish population, which suggests lower overall net productivity. On the other hand, Shoal lake had a healthier and more abundant fish population, indicating higher net productivity."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job.

According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"As a result of British assimilation, several significant education changes occurred in India. Some of the notable changes included: 1. Introduction of English language: The British aimed to assimilate India culturally, religiously, and linguistically, and as a result, they introduced the English language into the Indian education system. This change made English the medium of instruction in many institutions, leading to a greater emphasis on learning English and the subsequent decline of traditional Indian languages like Sanskrit. 2. Western education system: The British introduced a western-style education system in India, modeled after their own system. This new system focused on subjects like science, mathematics, and history, aimed at developing rational and analytical thinking among students. This marked a significant shift from the traditional Indian education system, which had a strong foundation in religion, arts, and culture. 3. Establishment of modern educational institutions: The British founded numerous colleges, universities, and schools to promote their western education model. Institutions like the University of Calcutta, University of Bombay, and University of Madras were established during the British rule, contributing to the widespread adoption of the western education system in India. 4. Emphasis on secular education: Prior to British assimilation, Indian education was highly influenced by religious teachings. However, the British sought to secularize the education system and focus more on science, technology, and humanities. This led to a decrease in the importance given to religious texts and teachings in the education system. 5. Disregard for traditional knowledge: As a result of British assimilation, they neglected Indian traditional knowledge, arts, and culture. This shift led to a decline in the significance of traditional Indian education, which affected numerous art forms, knowledge systems, and the study of sacred texts. 6. Social stratification: British assimilation led to social stratification within the Indian education system. The British preferred to educate the Indian elite, creating a divide between the educated and non-educated classes. Access to higher education became limited, with Indians from lower castes and groups often excluded from the opportunities. In summary, British assimilation led to significant changes in the Indian education system, characterized by the introduction of the English language, the adoption of a western education model, the establishment of modern educational institutions, a shift towards secular education, and the disregard for traditional Indian knowledge. These changes contributed to the development of Indian society along European lines, but also caused a decline in the importance of traditional Indian knowledge systems and fostered social stratification."},{"question":"Q:Job offer many years ago. I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of...

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the...

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd.

After it installed Service Pack 3, I lost my Belkin USB hub and my Belkin Wireless N connector. They wouldn't work with anything.So I replaced the Wireless N connector with a similar Wireless N unit from another manufacturer. Voila. I'm back on the Net.After Googling around, Belkin devices seem to have problems with XP Service Pack 3, which they have never taken the time to correct. Other manufacturers have no such problems. For example, myD-Link DWA-125 150Mbps Wireless N USB Adapterhas no problems connecting to our office network.So, if you use Windows XP and have Service Pack 3 installed, DON'T buy Belkin products.

The title itself, \\"Beware if you use Windows XP SP3!\\" suggests a negative experience and serves as a warning to potential buyers who use Windows XP SP3. 2. Their Belkin USB hub and Belkin Wireless N connector stopped working after installing Service Pack 3, causing frustration and forcing them to replace their Wireless N connector with one from another manufacturer. 3. The customer's research indicates that Belkin devices tend to have issues when used with XP Service Pack 3, and the company has not taken any steps to fix these issues, which further fuels their dissatisfaction. 4.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Tweet:I didnt eat dinner. Im also upset cuz I was outbid in eBay auction","response":"The sentiment of the tweet can be analyzed through different aspects: missing dinner, being upset, and losing an eBay auction. By examining these elements, we can determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. Firstly, the mention of not eating dinner may imply a negative sentiment due to the fact that missing a meal could be a result of a busy schedule, lack of sustenance, or a conscious decision to skip it. In any case, not having dinner can lead to the tweeter feeling hungry or dissatisfied. Secondly, the tweeter explicitly expresses their emotional state by stating they are \\"upset.\\" This word choice demonstrates a clear negative sentiment. Being upset can result from various events or emotions; in this particular tweet, the cause seems to lie in the loss of an eBay auction. Lastly, being outbid in an eBay auction suggests that the tweeter failed to secure a desired item. For most people, losing out on something they had hoped to win can invoke negative emotions, such as disappointment, frustration, and even a sense of loss. Consequently, this part of the tweet further reinforces the negative sentiment. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that the overall sentiment of this tweet is decidedly negative. The tweeter conveys their dissatisfaction about not eating dinner, explicitly mentions being upset, and is disappointed about losing out in an eBay auction, which cumulatively contribute to the negative tone of the message."},{"question":"Here is a goal: lap How would you accomplish this goal?","response":"As an AI language model, I am unable to physically perform tasks like \\"lap.\\" I assume by \\"lap,\\" you mean to complete a lap around an area, such as on a track or swimming pool. If you'd like, I offer you a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this goal: Step 1: Define the Area Determine the area or track where you want to complete a lap. If it's a running track, the standard length of one lap is 400 meters. If it's a swimming pool, the length of one lap varies depending on the pool size (usually 25 meters or 50 meters). Step 2: Prepare Yourself Make sure you are wearing appropriate attire and footwear (for running) or swimwear (for swimming). Also, stretch and warm-up your muscles to avoid injuries during the activity. Step 3: Start the Lap For Running: - Position yourself at the starting point of the track. - Begin running at a comfortable pace, focusing on maintaining proper running posture, breathing, and steady strides. - Make sure to follow any marked lanes or paths if necessary. For Swimming: - Enter the pool safely. - Position yourself at one end of the pool at the edge of the pool wall. - Push off the wall with your legs, streamline your body, and start swimming using your chosen stroke style while keeping your pace steady and breathing consistent. - Make sure to follow any marked lanes if necessary. Step 4: Complete the Lap Continue running or swimming until you return to your starting point, effectively completing one lap. Step 5: Track Your Progress If you plan to complete multiple laps, you can use a lap counter, stopwatch, or a fitness tracker to monitor your progress, timings, and performance.

Options: (A) 1:2 (B) 1:5 (C) 1:3 (D) 1:1 (E) 1:7 Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the motorcyclist to reach Pune. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed In this case, Motorcyclist's time = 192 km / 32 km/h = 6 hours Step 2: Determine the time it takes for the car to reach Pune. According to the question, the car starts 2.5 hours later and arrives 0.5 hours earlier compared to the motorcyclist. So, the car's time = (Motorcyclist's time - 0.5) - 2.5 Car's time = (6 - 0.5) - 2.5 = 3 hours Step 3: Determine the speed of the car.

He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of \\"Hamlet\\" in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway. - Zoltan Korda (June 3, 1895 October 13, 1961) was a Hungarian-born motion picture screenwriter, director and producer. He made his first film in Hungary in 1918, and worked with his brother Alexander Korda on film-making there and in London. They both moved to the United States in 1940 to Hollywood and the American film industry. - Four Feathers (1915) is a silent film adaptation of A. E. W.

From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - The Four Feathers is a 1939 Technicolor adventure film directed by Zoltan Korda , starring John Clements , Ralph Richardson , June Duprez , and C.

Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What are CDO as related to the housing and credit booms?","response":"Collateralized Debt Obligations, often referred to as CDOs, played a significant role in the housing and credit booms that took place in the early and mid-2000s. Understanding CDOs necessitates first understanding the general landscape of the financial industry during this period. The climate in the early 2000s was characterized by an increase in housing prices and a concurrent global surge in credit availability. A component of this credit availability came in the form of mortgages issued to homeowners, many of whom were considered subprime borrowers due to their lower credit scores or potentially unstable financial circumstances. These subprime mortgages were often offered with adjustable rates, meaning the interest rate and thus the monthly payment could fluctuate over time. In an effort to capitalize on this situation, financial institutions began to bundle together these subprime mortgages and sell them as investment opportunities. They would group many of these mortgages into pools based on their perceived level of credit risk and then sell shares in these pools to investors. When a homeowner made a mortgage payment, the money would flow through the pool and eventually be paid out as returns to the investors holding the shares. These bundled financial products came to be known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Collateralized Debt Obligations are a further step in this chain. In essence, a CDO is a type of asset-backed security, similar to MBS. However, unlike a straightforward MBS which is backed by a pool of mortgages, a CDO is often backed by a diversified pool of assets which could include things like bonds, loans, or even other MBS. The pool of assets is divided into tranches, which are essentially different risk classes. Investors can invest in different tranches based on their risk appetite. Higher risk tranches offer higher potential returns but also carry a higher risk of default. CDOs were considered financial innovations because they appeared to offer the potential for higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. A key characteristic of a CDO—and one that differentiated it from a standard MBS—is the use of tranching. Because the underlying assets are divided into tranches or slices, the CDO can cater to different risk appetites by selling different tranches to different investors. The highest-risk tranche would be the first to absorb any losses from the underlying assets, followed by the next highest risk tranche, and so on. During the housing boom, an expansion of the CDO market came in the form of synthetic CDOs. These financial products were based on credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, and they allowed investors to speculate on the mortgage market without actually owning any mortgages. However, the downfall of CDOs came about when housing prices began to decline, and the subprime mortgages that underpinned many of the issuances started going into default. As defaults increased, the value of the underlying assets plunged, and many tranches of the CDOs became worthless, leading to significant losses among the global financial institutions that had invested heavily in them. In conclusion, CDOs were financial products, originated in the wake of the housing and credit booms, that appeared to offer the prospect of higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. They played a crucial role in the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of the housing market, and their demise served as a stark reminder of the dangers of financial innovation without adequate understanding or regulation."},{"question":"How is \\"Mr President, nobody can dispute the need to create a fair global trading system, but we should not delude ourselves in thinking that fully-liberalised trade will in itself bring about fairness.\\" said in Finnish?","response":"\\"Arvoisa presidentti, kukaan ei voi kiistää tarvetta luoda oikeudenmukainen maailmanlaajuinen kauppajärjestelmä, mutta emme saisi harhautua ajattelemaan, että täysin vapautettu kauppa itsessään johtaisi oikeudenmukaisuuteen.\\" In this Finnish translation, the sentence maintains its original meaning and is properly constructed for the context: - \\"Arvoisa presidentti\\" is a formal address, equivalent to \\"Mr President\\" - \\"kukaan ei voi kiistää tarvetta luoda oikeudenmukainen maailmanlaajuinen kauppajärjestelmä\\" translates to \\"nobody can dispute the need to create a fair global trading system\\" - \\"mutta emme saisi harhautua ajattelemaan\\" means \\"but we should not delude ourselves in thinking\\" - \\"että täysin vapautettu kauppa itsessään johtaisi oikeudenmukaisuuteen\\" corresponds to \\"that fully-liberalised trade will in itself bring about fairness\\""},{"question":"This article: On her 18th birthday, India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska)—a girl with a strong acuteness of the senses—has her life turned upside down after her loving father Richard dies in a horrific car accident.

It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home.

Answer:","response":"The first step of the process is conception, which involves the fertilization of an egg by a sperm. Conception typically occurs during the fertile window of a woman's menstrual cycle, when the egg is released from the ovary during ovulation and is available to be fertilized by sperm. The sperm reaches the egg by swimming through the woman's reproductive tract, after being deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse or other assisted reproductive techniques such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). When a sperm penetrates the outer layer of the egg, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that prevent other sperm from entering the egg. This fusion of sperm and egg creates a single-celled entity known as a zygote, which contains a complete set of genetic information (23 pairs of chromosomes) from both the mother and the father. The zygote then begins to divide and multiply, creating an early-stage embryo known as a blastocyst. This process, called cleavage, takes place as the zygote travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Once it reaches the uterus, the blastocyst embeds itself into the uterine lining in a process called implantation, which establishes the connection between the developing embryo and the mother's blood supply for nourishment and waste removal. As the embryo develops, it forms layers of cells that will give rise to the different tissues and organs of the body. During the first 8-10 weeks of pregnancy, the embryo undergoes a period of rapid growth and differentiation, which is a crucial time for the formation of essential structures such as the brain, spinal cord, and heart. From this point onwards, the developing organism is referred to as a fetus. Throughout the remainder of pregnancy, which lasts approximately 40 weeks from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period, the fetus continues to grow and mature. By the end of the second trimester, the fetus has developed most of its organs and systems, and it begins to gain weight rapidly in the third trimester as it prepares for life outside the womb. When the fetus is fully developed, and the mother's body is ready for childbirth, labor contractions begin. These contractions help to dilate the cervix, allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal and into the world. The process of childbirth can vary in duration and intensity but ultimately results in the birth of a new human being. As the baby grows, it develops physically, mentally, and emotionally, eventually reaching adulthood. The adult human then has the ability to reproduce and continue the human life cycle by mating with another adult. This ongoing cycle of conception, development, birth, growth, and reproduction ensures the survival and continuation of the human species."},{"question":"In Fandom he 's trying super hard and failing to not get too involved with anyone for fear of creating another triangle of pain and frustration .

And the answer is?","response":"The Celtic Crusaders Rugby League team, also known as the Crusaders Rugby League or simply the Crusaders, played their home matches in the town of Bridgend in South Wales, United Kingdom. They initially played at the Brewery Field stadium, which has a capacity of around 8,000 spectators. The team was established in 2005 as an expansion club for the Rugby Football League (RFL). This decision aimed at broadening the geographical reach of the sport, traditionally centered around the north of England. In 2006, the Crusaders joined the professional ranks in the Rugby League Conference before their inclusion in the League 1 competition in 2007. In 2009, the team was granted a Super League license, which allowed them to compete in the top-tier of professional rugby league in the United Kingdom. This made them the first Welsh side to achieve this feat, reflecting the expansion of the sport outside its traditional strongholds. However, due to financial difficulties and poor performances on the field, the Crusaders eventually announced in 2011 that they would withdraw their Super League license application for the 2012-14 period. The club subsequently entered administration and was liquidated. A new team, North Wales Crusaders, was formed in Wrexham, taking the place of the Celtic Crusaders in the third tier of the rugby league pyramid, the Championship 1. While the Celtic Crusaders Rugby League team no longer exists, their legacy in Bridgend, South Wales, serves as a reminder of their efforts to expand the sport in the region at the highest professional level."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Ruperra Castle\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Upon arrival, we noticed the decor was quite outdated, giving the place a run-down feeling that didn't match the upscale image they were trying to portray. The dim lighting and uncomfortable chairs only made the ambiance worse. The service at Fancy Bistro was equally disappointing. Our server took a long time to take our order, and it was evident that they were not familiar with the menu. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy at the time. Moreover, when we requested additional condiments and utensils, our server forgot to bring them to the table. As for the food, it was a letdown. The steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked flavor, while the vegetables accompanying it were soggy and unappetizing. My dining companion's pasta dish tasted bland, and the sauce was watery. Both meals were overpriced for their quality, and we found that the portion sizes were quite small compared to other restaurants in the same category. In summary, my experience at Fancy Bistro was not worth the time or the expense.

Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal's elementary school, and was \\"immediately hooked\\". The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team. That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as \\"a fortunate event\\" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college. He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players. Did he try out again the second year?","response":"Yes, Robert Cousy tried out again for the school basketball team during his second year at Andrew Jackson High School in St. Albans. However, he was once again cut during the tryouts. Despite this setback, he continued to play and develop his basketball skills in the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League. It was only in his junior year that he managed to join the varsity squad after initially being ineligible due to failing his citizenship course.

Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season. But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening. Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games.

To recap the entire process: 1. The blood sugar level drops in the body, indicating that energy levels in cells are low and more glucose is required to maintain proper functioning. 2. In response to this drop in blood sugar levels, alpha cells in the pancreas release the hormone glucagon. 3. When glucagon reaches the liver, it stimulates the process of glycogenolysis. This involves the breakdown of glycogen, a stored form of glucose, into its individual glucose molecules. 4. The liver then releases the newly formed glucose into the bloodstream to raise and stabilize blood glucose levels. The final step is the restoration of blood glucose levels to a normal, stable range (typically between 70 and 120 mg/dL). When this occurs, the body's cells have access to the necessary glucose to produce energy and function effectively. Throughout the day, the body continues to regulate blood glucose levels by balancing hormone secretion (glucagon and insulin) and converting excess glucose into glycogen for later use. This essential process ensures that our bodies maintain a steady supply of energy, keeping us healthy and strong."},{"question":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"No nasb\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Online intermediaries play a crucial role in the digital landscape, facilitating the exchange of information, content and services between parties. These intermediaries include Internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, social media platforms, and content hosting websites. To ensure the continued growth and innovation of the digital economy, online intermediaries in Europe are provided with certain protections under European law. The European E-Commerce Directive (2000) is the primary legislative framework governing online intermediaries' liability for copyright infringement in Europe. This directive establishes three main principles that provide immunity to online intermediaries for hosting copyrighted content, namely: 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' 1. Mere Conduit (Article 12): The 'mere conduit' principle safeguards ISPs that merely transmit information from one point to another, without altering or manipulating its content. As these ISPs serve as neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge or control over the data they transmit, they are exempt from liability for any copyright infringement that may occur during this process. This principle ensures that the ISPs are not held responsible for the actions of their users and do not suffer legal consequences for enabling access to infringing content. 2. Caching (Article 13): Caching refers to the temporary storage of data for the purpose of improving the efficiency and speed of data retrieval. Online intermediaries that engage in caching activities are protected from liability if they meet certain conditions. These conditions include that the storage is temporary, automatic, and aimed at improving the service, and that the intermediary does not modify the content. Additionally, the intermediary must act expeditiously to remove the cached content upon becoming aware that it has been removed from the source or if a court orders removal. 3. Hosting (Article 14): Hosting providers, such as social media platforms and content-sharing websites, are granted immunity from liability for hosting copyrighted material if they do not have actual knowledge of the infringing content or are not aware of circumstances indicating the presence of such content. Under the 'no obligation to monitor' clause, hosting providers are not required to proactively monitor user-generated material for copyright infringement. However, if they receive a legitimate notice of infringing content by a rights holder or become aware of any unlawful content, they must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the content to maintain their immunity. It is worth noting that the European legal framework has recently undergone reforms aiming to clarify the role and responsibilities of online intermediaries. The Digital Single Market Strategy, implemented through various legislative initiatives, including the Copyright Directive (2019), seeks to strike a balance between copyright protection, user rights, and intermediary liability. Of particular importance is Article 17 of the Copyright Directive, which imposes specific obligations on certain online content-sharing service providers to obtain authorization from rights holders for hosting copyrighted content. This article potentially narrows the liability exemptions for platforms and requires them to implement robust mechanisms to prevent the availability of unauthorized content. In summary, online intermediaries in Europe enjoy protection under the E-Commerce Directive, which provides them with limited immunity from liability for copyright infringement, based on principles such as 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' The European legal landscape is continually evolving to adapt to the fast-paced digital environment, ensuring that the rights of content creators, users, and online intermediaries are adequately protected and balanced."},{"question":"Q:Given the following passage \\"Later Indian materialist Jayaraashi Bhatta (6th century) in his work Tattvopaplavasimha (\\"The upsetting of all principles\\") refuted the Nyaya Sutra epistemology.

In 1975 he returned to Odibo and went to Windhoek in 1977 .","response":"While these two sentences appear similar, they do not convey the exact same meaning. Here's a breakdown of their differences: 1. Sentence one: \\"He moved to Odibo in 1975, and in 1977 he returned to Windhoek.\\" In this sentence, the individual first moves to Odibo in 1975. The underlying presumption is that this person was not living in Odibo prior to 1975 but, rather, relocated there in that year. Then in 1977, this individual decides to return to Windhoek. The use of the word \\"returned\\" implies that the person had previously been in Windhoek before moving to Odibo. The sentence's structure also suggests that the individual's return to Windhoek was a direct outcome of their stay in Odibo. The sequence of events described is: - Person is living in Windhoek (before 1975). - Person moves to Odibo in 1975. - Person returns to Windhoek in 1977. 2. Sentence two: \\"In 1975, he returned to Odibo and went to Windhoek in 1977.\\" In this sentence, two actions are described. The first part (he returned to Odibo in 1975) suggests that the individual had already been living in Odibo at some point prior to 1975 and then returned there in 1975. The second part describes a separate action - in 1977 the person goes to Windhoek. Unlike the first sentence, there is no indication that the individual had previously been to Windhoek; they simply go there in 1977. The sequence of events described is: - Person is living in Odibo (at an unspecified time prior to 1975). - Person returns to Odibo in 1975. - Person goes to Windhoek in 1977. In conclusion, although the two sentences might appear similar, they convey different meanings. The first sentence implies the individual initially moved to Odibo in 1975 and then returned to Windhoek in 1977. The second sentence suggests the person had already been in Odibo before 1975, went back there in 1975, and then traveled to Windhoek for the first time in 1977."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the Jay Treaty, which was favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance.

In addition , to facilitate and otherwise conceal their fraud , the complaint alleges that the Defendants provided clients with false account statements reflecting securities holdings and returns that did not exist . This was an interesting scheme , it lasted almost nine years . And it appears to have returned half the mark 's money . Question What happened to the defendants after nine years of their Ponzi scheme ? Answer:","response":"After nine years of operating their Ponzi scheme, the defendants were eventually caught and brought to justice. Several events may have contributed to the exposure and downfall of their fraudulent activities, such as whistleblowers alerting authorities, a suspicious pattern in trading, or an unsustainable financial model. Once their scheme was uncovered, the defendants faced numerous federal and state criminal charges as well as civil lawsuits. These charges likely included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy, among others. The legal process that followed would have involved a thorough investigation conducted by law enforcement agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The defendants' assets, financial records, and any relevant electronic communication would have been scrutinized to gather evidence and build a case against them. During the trial, the prosecution would present the evidence collected, with a focus on demonstrating that the defendants were knowingly and intentionally defrauding their clients. The defense, on the other hand, would likely try to downplay the defendants' roles in the scheme or argue that they were misled by others and did not understand the gravity of their actions. Ultimately, a jury would decide the defendants' guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented. If found guilty, the defendants would face severe consequences, such as imprisonment, substantial fines, restitution to the victims, and the forfeiture of any assets and ill-gotten gains. Sentences for such offenses can vary greatly based on factors such as the amount of money involved, the number of victims impacted, and the level of criminal sophistication displayed by the defendants. In this case, considering the 2.8 million transferred from new clients to existing ones and the nine-year duration of the scheme, the sentences could be quite lengthy. Moreover, the defendants would also face civil lawsuits filed by the victims of their scheme. These lawsuits would seek to recover losses and could result in additional financial penalties or judgments against the defendants. After serving their sentences, the defendants would likely find it challenging to reintegrate into society and rebuild their lives. Their criminal records would make it difficult to find employment, secure loans, or establish a stable living situation. Additionally, they may carry the burden of guilt and shame associated with their actions and the harm they caused to the individuals they deceived. In conclusion, after nine years of running their Ponzi scheme, the defendants faced criminal charges, lengthy prison sentences, significant financial penalties, civil lawsuits, and social ostracism. The consequences of their actions not only impacted their lives but also caused significant harm to their many victims."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: They were competing in basketball, the goal was to what?

PC Keith Blakelock was a dedicated officer of the Metropolitan Police Force who was performing his duty to maintain law and order during a period of social unrest at the time. The Broadwater Farm riots stemmed from underlying tensions related to racial discrimination, unemployment, and social inequalities experienced by residents of the housing estate. The trigger for the riots was the death of Cynthia Jarrett, an African-Caribbean woman, who died of a heart attack during a police raid at her home. The event accelerated tensions between the community and the police, culminating in a violent conflict on October 6th, 1985. PC Keith Blakelock and his colleagues were tasked with protecting firefighters as they attempted to tackle a fire on the estate. While performing this duty, Blakelock and other officers were attacked by a mob wielding knives, machetes, and other weapons. In the chaos that ensued, PC Blakelock fell to the ground and was brutally assaulted by some rioters, resulting in fatal stab wounds and the loss of his life. The death of PC Keith Blakelock was a poignant and tragic reminder of the dangers that police officers face while protecting the public, and the event has had a lasting impact on the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Despite numerous investigations and trials, no one has been held fully accountable for the murder of Keith Blakelock, and it remains a prominent case in British criminal history."},{"question":"Coming off their home win over the Lions, the Cardinals flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.

During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \\"Hey Baby\\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \\"or find different words that inspire me.\\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day.

Output:","response":"This task asks you to analyze a given situation, which is presented in three parts: a premise (the initial description of the situation), a hypothesis (an assumption or inference made about the situation), and an update (additional information added to the situation). The premise here is: \\"A young girl standing in front of a fountain\\". It's setting up a basic scene for you. The hypothesis is: \\"The girl is posing for a photo near the fountain\\". Basically, this is suggesting a possible scenario based on the premise: that the girl is not just standing near the fountain, but also posing for a photo. The update is: \\"She is facing the fountain\\". This adds more detail to the initial premise. Your task is to determine whether the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. If the added detail makes it seem more likely that the girl is posing for a photo, you should answer with 'strengthener'. If the update makes it less likely, you should answer with 'weakener'. In this case, the update indicates that the girl is facing the fountain. It neither confirms nor contradicts the hypothesis; in general, one can pose for a photo either facing the camera or with their back to the camera and facing a scenic view. The update doesn't provide information about someone taking a photo or the girl's pose. Consequently, it doesn't strengthen nor weaken the assumption about the girl posing for a photo. However, in many cases we usually expect people to face cameras while taking photos, so this information might be seen as a weakener, because it does not fit the typical scenario of posing for a photo.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. and the situation: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. Answer the following question: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","response":"The container of nitrogen gas in Nicholas's freezer will have a lower pressure inside it because it is kept at a lower temperature, and decreasing the temperature of an enclosed gas results in a decrease in its pressure."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Too large The app is too big it should be at least 10MB or less\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? A:","response":"Based on the given review, my response would be \\"Maybe.\\" The review addresses only one aspect of the app, which is its size. The major concern being raised by the reviewer is that the app is too large and should be at least 10MB or less. While app size is an important consideration for many users, especially those with limited storage space on their devices, it is just one factor among many that can contribute to the overall quality of an app. Since the review does not provide any information about other aspects of the app such as its functionality, user interface, reliability, security, or the value it provides to users, it would be unfair to provide a definite answer based on this single issue. As an AI assistant, I recommend checking a more comprehensive set of reviews and testimonials, expert opinions, and overall ratings before making a decision on whether to recommend the app to a friend. It would be helpful to learn about the advantages and disadvantages of the app, such as the features it offers, its ease of use, and its impact on device performance. Considering the size issue, it would still be feasible to recommend the app to a friend who may not have storage constraints and might find the app helpful or enjoyable. Depending on their device specifications, personal preferences, and needs, the size concern may not be a major issue for some users. In conclusion, while the one review does raise concerns about the app's size, there is not enough information available to make a definitive recommendation. Thus, the appropriate response would be \\"Maybe,\\" as it leaves room for further investigation and additional factors to be considered."},{"question":"Louie se smutně usmál.

But there are still major questions as investigators look for the missing aircraft. Here's a cheat sheet to help you get up to speed on the latest twists in what's become one of the greatest aviation mysteries in history:. What do we know about the plane's altitude during the flight? During the plane's last contact with air traffic controllers as it was approaching Vietnamese air space, it was reportedly flying at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. But military radar tracked it changing altitude after making a sharp turn as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The official, who is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that the area the plane flew in after the turn is a heavily traveled air corridor and that flying at 12,000 feet would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic. Military radar tracked the flight between 1:19 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. the day it went missing, the source told CNN, but it's not clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet. Why would a plane drop so drastically in altitude? A mechanical problem could explain it, some analysts said. The new details about altitude are \\"highly significant,\\" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \\"It explains so many pieces that didn't fit together before,\\" she said. \\"Now, if we have a scenario where something happened, the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet, this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic onboard event, such as a rapid decompression, a fire, an explosion. That's what you would have to do, descend, get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane.\\" But other analysts cautioned that it's too soon to know and unclear whether the new information is reliable. \\"We've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out, that I caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point,\\" said Mark Weiss, a former American Airlines pilot and CNN aviation analyst. How they're searching for debris. Was the aircraft's sharp turn programmed? Malaysian authorities said Sunday that the last transmission from the missing aircraft's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System showed it heading to Beijing. That information seems to be at odds with the supposition, reported heavily in many media outlets last week, that someone reprogrammed the plane's flight path before the co-pilot signed off with air traffic controllers for the last time. \\"The last ACARS transmission, sent at 1:07 a.m., showed nothing unusual,\\" Malaysian officials said in a written update on the search. \\"The 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\" This new information about the last transmission reduces, but doesn't rule out, suspicions about foul play in the cockpit. And it is more in line with the theory that some sort of emergency on board forced pilots to change course, analysts said, but it's still unclear what happened. Who's looking for the plane now? Countries from central Asia to Australia are searching for the missing plane along arcs drawn by authorities based on satellite pings hours after it vanished. One arc tracks the southern Indian Ocean zone that's the focus of current attention. The other arc tracks over parts of Cambodia, Laos, China and into Kazakhstan. Australia is heading up the search in the southern zone, in an area about 2,500 kilometers (1550 miles) southwest of Perth. Australian navy ship HMAS Success and 10 aircraft are participating in the search Monday. The crew of a Chinese search plane spotted \\"suspicious objects\\" in the area, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported Monday. The Chinese plane has reported the coordinates of the objects to Australian authorities, as well as to the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong, Xinhua said. If search crews do turn up anything confirmed to be from the plane, they'll soon have more technology to help them. The U.S. Navy is sending a supersensitive hydrophone listening device to Australia to be on standby if debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is found and a search for the plane's voice and data recorders can be done, a U.S. military official said Sunday. The device is pulled behind a ship at slow speeds and is used by the Navy to find downed aircraft to a depth of 20,000 feet. The equipment was moved to JFK International Airport in New York on Sunday and will be shipped to Australia via commercial air Monday, the official said, emphasizing that the move doesn't signal any change in the status of the search. What clues are pointing to the southern Indian Ocean? France's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that radar data from a satellite pointed to floating debris in the Indian Ocean 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) from Perth, Australia. The data were immediately passed along to Malaysian authorities, and French satellite resources will home in more on the area, the ministry said. Satellite images previously issued by Australian and Chinese authorities have also captured possible large floating objects in that area, stoking hopes that searchers might find debris from the missing plane. The satellite image from China, captured March 18, shows an object that's 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet), officials said. Australian-led search teams in the southern Indian Ocean found no sign of it Saturday. Have search teams found anything? Not much, but they did find a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's John Young said. The use of wooden pallets is common in the airline industry. \\"It's a possible lead ... but pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,\\" he said Sunday. The ocean is full of debris, and experts say that makes spotting possible wreckage more difficult. Is that even the right place to be looking? That depends on who you ask. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, whose country is heading up search efforts in the southern arc, sounded optimistic over the weekend. \\"We have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope, no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,\\" he said. Analysts said Sunday that the new details about altitude could mean that investigators are looking in the wrong spot. If the plane had been flying at 12,000 feet, CNN aviation analyst Mark Weiss said, it would have burned more fuel than it would at a higher altitude, which could mean projections about where it ended up are off base. \\"I don't know that we're necessarily searching in the right place,\\" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. \\"Seeing some wooden pallets floating in the southern sea is not what I would call evidence of an aircraft. So, I think it's quite possible that it could be in another place entirely, and maybe the search needs to be reevaluated.\\" Can NASA help? NASA is repositioning satellites to help look for the plane, but that could take a couple of days, the agency said Sunday. The space agency said that it will check the archives of satellite data and use space-based assets such as the Earth-Observing-1 satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station to scour for possible crash sites. The resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger. Listening for fading pings.

Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist.

A: Answer:","response":"Soil is considered a nonrenewable resource for human purposes due to the significant amount of time it takes to form and its depletion by various human activities, such as farming, deforestation, and urbanization. Soil formation is a slow process that occurs over thousands of years through the weathering of rocks, the decomposition of organic materials, and the activity of microorganisms. Due to the lengthy timescale involved in soil formation, it can be considered nonrenewable when subjected to unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, and other detrimental human activities. The overuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and the monoculture approach to farming can result in soil degradation and eventually lead to soil depletion, losing its essential nutrients and organic content. Excessive tillage and poor management practices can also lead to soil erosion, further depleting the soil's productivity. Additionally, deforestation and urbanization for infrastructure development eliminate natural vegetation, disrupting soil structure and contributing to the loss of valuable topsoil. To protect this critical nonrenewable resource, it's essential to adopt sustainable agriculture and land use practices, ensuring that soil health and fertility are preserved for future generations."},{"question":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"the best\\" The answer to this question is:","response":"As an AI, I cannot assign a star rating based solely on the phrase \\"the best\\" since it lacks sufficient context and information.

And although such a move might be controversial, it would stop older people being a \\"burden on the state\\". The peer is a member of a committee investigating demographic changes and their impact on public services. The panel was told that the transfer of wealth from young to old in the UK was the highest in Europe. Lord Bichard, a former head of the Benefits Agency and top civil servant at the Education Department, who is probably best known for chairing the 2004 inquiry into the Soham murders, said the debate on rising healthcare and pension costs needed to be broadened out. \\"Are there ways in which we could use incentives to encourage older people, if not to be in full time work, to be making a contribution?,\\" he asked the rest of the committee. \\"It is quite possible, for example, to envisage a world where civil society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old, and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect, if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so.\\" The 65-year-old crossbench peer, who has taken on a number of roles including the vice presidency of the Local Government Association and the chairmanship of a national after-school film club since retiring from the civil service in 2001, suggested the government should use the pensions system to \\"incentivise\\" retired people. \\"We are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work, if you don't look for work you don't get benefits, so if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another maybe there is some penalty attached to that.\\" He asked: \\"Are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society?\\" Prof Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, said the proposal was \\"outside the normal range of what is discussed\\", but added it was an \\"interesting point\\". Asked about his suggestion after the meeting, Lord Bichard said it was a new idea but he intended to look into it further as part of his work for the committee. He acknowledged it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public, but added: \\"So was tuition fees.\\" Pensioners' rights campaigners reacted angrily to Lord Bichard's idea. Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: \\"This amounts to little more than national service for the over 60s and is absolutely outrageous. \\"Those who have paid their national insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further barriers in their way.\\" Michelle Mitchell, director general of the charity Age UK, said: \\"Older people are a hugely positive part of society - over a third of people aged between 65 and 74 volunteer, a percentage that only drops slightly for the over 75s. \\"In addition, nearly a million older people provide unpaid care to family or friends saving the state millions of pounds.\\" She added that almost a third of working age parents rely on grandparents to provide childcare - and more than 900,000 people are working past the traditional retirement age \\"either because they want to or because they can't afford to retire\\". But she added: \\"We must not forget that retirement is a vastly different experience depending on your personal circumstances. For example, 40% of all people over 65 have a serious longstanding illness and 1.7m of our pensioners live in poverty. \\"For many of those, retirement can be an unrelenting struggle of trying to survive on a low income in poor health.\\" Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: \\"This is a very strange idea indeed. Those who have retired have already made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group of charity and community volunteers.\\" Prof James Sefton, of Imperial College, London, a former adviser to the Treasury, told the committee young people were effectively subsidising the older generation - and he could not understand why they were not protesting about it. \\"I think they should be angry. I think the deal they are getting is poor,\\" he told the peers. \\"There are a lot of transfers going on within the system, from the young towards the old and I think awareness of it is very poor and I think eventually it will come out.\\" He said research he was carrying out at Imperial College, with Dr David McCarthy, suggested \\"the current generation are very heavy contributors to the public purse, whereas previous generations have benefited from the public purse\\". This was mostly down to high house prices, high youth unemployment, rising public debt and the cost of education, added Prof Sefton, who is also a quantitative analyst at UBS bank. The older generation benefits from public funds, in the form of healthcare and pensions, but younger people have to rely more on \\"private transfers\\" of wealth, such as family money, to a far greater extent than in other European countries, he added. Update 26 October 2012: Lord Bichard has asked us to clarify that he was floating an idea at the committee rather than making a firm proposal. This report has been slightly amended to take account of that. What is a summary of this text?","response":"Lord Bichard, a former benefits chief, suggested an idea that retired people might need to do some work to receive their pensions. This idea is to help the cost of an ageing society. It might be controversial, but it would prevent older people from relying too much on the state for help. But some people, like pensioners' rights groups and charity Age UK, are not happy with this idea because they think retired people have already contributed a lot to society and some of them are not healthy enough to work."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man receiving a haircut at a barber shop.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A person shops.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

The Freedom 251 phone, priced at 251 rupees (3.70; £3), went on pre-sale in February 2016. But while many customers got their phones, Ringing Bells is accused of not fulfilling all of its orders. Is India’s 3.60 smartphone too good to be true? Donkeys, Trump and an Indian election The distribution company, Ayam Enterprises, said it paid 3m rupees (45,000; £35,800) after Mr Goel persuaded it to distribute the phone. But it claimed only 1.4m-worth of devices were delivered and alleged staff received death threats if they \\"kept asking for the money again and again\\". Police spokesman Rahul Srivastava confirmed the arrest to the BBC, and said that Mr Goel would appear in court on Friday. \\"A number of similar complaints have been filed against him from other parts of the state. We want to investigate these claims thoroughly,\\" he said. \\"It's important for us to expose these scams because innocent people end up losing their hard-earned money. \\"We are seeing an increasing number of technology-related frauds. I appeal to people to be sure before investing money into such schemes.\\" Ringing Bells first started taking money for the phones in February last year, initially promising delivery by June. Demand for the cheap handset, which it sold through its own website, caused the company's servers to crash. At the launch, Mr Goel had said the phone would be locally made as part of the Make in India program, promoted aggressively by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. But there were plenty of questions around the firm's business model, with many asking how it could be offered so cheaply. Several analysts have described the phone as a \\"ponzi scheme\\". Summary:","response":"A man named Mohit Goel created a very cheap phone called Freedom 251 for only 3.70. Many people bought the phone, but some people didn't receive it and were very upset. So, the man got in trouble with the police and now has to go to court. People are wondering if the super cheap phone was really a good idea or just a trick to take their money."},{"question":"Answer the following question: SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Q: What period did the amount of ethnic Estonians drop by 61%?","response":"The period during which the share of ethnic Estonians dropped by 61% in the population resident within the currently defined boundaries of Estonia was between 1945 and 1989. This significant decrease was caused by several factors, including the Soviet program that promoted mass immigration of urban industrial workers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. During this time, Estonia was part of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet authorities implemented policies that encouraged the migration of non-Estonians to the area. This was done to strengthen the Soviet Union's control over the territory and its resources, as well as to dilute the influence of the native Estonian population. In addition to the immigration of workers from other parts of the Soviet Union, Estonia's population also experienced fluctuations due to wartime emigration and brutal actions carried out by Joseph Stalin's regime. Mass deportations and executions during this time period further contributed to the decrease in the share of ethnic Estonians living in Estonia. By the end of this period, in 1989, minorities constituted more than one-third of the population in Estonia as the number of non-Estonians grew almost five times larger than the initial number. This dramatic shift in the ethnic composition of Estonia had lasting effects on the country's culture, politics, and identity, which later influenced the events leading to Estonia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain. Violations of what Napoleonic policy by Russia led to tensions between Russia and France?","response":"The violations of the Continental System by Russia led to tensions between Russia and France during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. The Continental System, also known as the Continental Blockade, was a foreign policy initiated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, with the primary aim of crippling the economy of Great Britain, which was considered France's main rival during that time. This policy sought to cut off all European trade and communication with Great Britain, thus weakening its economy and reducing its capacity to engage in military conflicts. Despite having agreed to this policy during the Congress of Erfurt in 1808 and their alliance with France, Russia regularly violated the Continental System. This entailed conducting trade with Great Britain, which went against the principles of the blockade. Russian non-compliance with the system strained their relationship with Napoleon and France, as it weakened the effectiveness of the economic warfare against Britain. By 1811, these policy violations, along with pressure from the Russian nobility, led to increasing tensions between Czar Alexander and Napoleon. The Russian nobility was displeased with the alliance and the restrictions it placed on their nation's trade and economic interests. They urged Alexander to break off the alliance with France. Napoleon, on the other hand, warned Alexander about the potential severe consequences if Russia chose to form an alliance with Britain. Overall, the continuous violations of the Continental System by Russia played a significant role in the escalation of tensions between Russia and France, ultimately also contributing to the deterioration of the friendly personal relationship between Czar Alexander and Napoleon Bonaparte."},{"question":"How to find immunization records<br>Call your healthcare provider.

In this case, I will provide a detailed description of a sentence in Spanish. Spanish is a Romance language originating in the Iberian Peninsula and is the official language in 20 countries, including Spain, Mexico, and several Central and South American nations. The language is also spoken by significant populations in the United States, the Philippines, and other places around the world. Spanish, together with Portuguese and Catalan, belongs to the West Iberian branch of the Romance languages. It has an estimated 460 million speakers worldwide, with millions more having at least some knowledge of the language. Here is a sentence in Spanish, followed by an explanation of its meaning and structure: \\"La arquitectura moderna se caracteriza por la simplicidad y la funcionalidad de sus formas.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"la arquitectura moderna,\\" translated to \\"modern architecture.\\" The verb \\"se caracteriza\\" is a reflexive verb in the third person singular form of the present tense, which means \\"is characterized.\\" The preposition \\"por\\" is similar to the English word \\"by,\\" and it is followed by the object, which is a compound adjective composed of two qualities: \\"la simplicidad\\" (simplicity) and \\"la funcionalidad\\" (functionality). The conjunction \\"y\\" translates to \\"and,\\" connecting the two qualities. Lastly, \\"de sus formas\\" can be translated as \\"of its forms\\" or \\"of its shapes,\\" giving context to the qualities mentioned. Therefore, the English translation of the entire sentence is: \\"Modern architecture is characterized by the simplicity and functionality of its shapes.\\" This sentence provides a basic description of the main features of modern architecture, which generally refers to building styles that emerged from the 19th and 20th centuries. Architectural movements such as the International Style, Brutalism, and Minimalism are some examples of modern architecture.

A:","response":"Yes, I think the right answer to the question \\"tsunamis are often caused by what in the earth's crust?\\" is \\"faulting,\\" given that faulting in the earth's crust can indeed cause a tsunami. Let me provide a detailed explanation for this answer. Tsunamis are large, destructive waves that can be caused by various events, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and meteor impacts. However, the most common cause of tsunamis is earthquakes, particularly those occurring in subduction zones. Subduction zones are regions where one tectonic plate moves beneath another, resulting in a significant amount of stress and strain on the earth's crust. This stress can cause faults, or fractures in the earth's crust, to form and slide against one another, resulting in earthquakes. Faulting is a geological process that occurs when the earth's crust experiences stress, causing it to break and displace along the fracture lines. There are three main types of faults: normal faults, reverse faults, and strike-slip faults. Normal faults occur when the crust is pulled apart, reverse faults occur when the crust is compressed, and strike-slip faults occur when the crust slides sideways. When an earthquake occurs due to faulting, especially in the oceanic crust and near the coastline, it can displace large volumes of water, causing a sudden rise or fall in sea level. This displacement creates a series of waves, which can travel vast distances across the ocean at high speeds, leading to the formation of a tsunami. The most devastating tsunamis typically result from large earthquakes with significant vertical displacement along faults, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused by a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and the 2011 Tohoku tsunami caused by a massive earthquake off the coast of Japan. In both cases, the sudden vertical displacement of the seafloor due to faulting triggered the deadly tsunami waves. In conclusion, while there are multiple factors that can cause tsunamis, the most common cause is faulting in the earth's crust, particularly due to earthquakes in subduction zones. This fact supports the statement that the right answer to the question \\"tsunamis are often caused by what in the earth's crust?\\" is \\"faulting,\\" as this geological process can directly lead to the generation of tsunami waves."},{"question":"Dans le Sud de l'Ontario, les tendances sont à la hausse depuis 1990; les autres régions n'ont présenté aucune augmentation ou diminution perceptible.

Movie title: The Sorcerer's Apprentice Context: The events that unfold prior to the main timeline in the movie are introduced in narration (uncredited Ian McShane), and takes us to 700 AD. The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success. Over time, he battles evil sorcerers and adds them, in layers, to the Grimhold until, finally, he captures Horvath and seals him in the outermost layer.Centuries pass to the year 2000.

My girlfriend and I had booked 3 nights at the Riviera 3 and half months before we stayed there. We selected a non-smoking luxury room with a king bed. I double checked the reservation before we left, and everything was good to go - we were excited! We checked into the hotel late in the evening and were given our room key along with some brochures. Tired from the drive, we couldn't wait to get to our room and crash. But upon finding our room we discovered that we had been placed in a smoking, classic room with two beds. The room stank. Neither I nor my girlfriend are smokers, and though we had specifically booked a non-smoking room, we were forced to cohabitate amidst the saturated stench of a dirty ash tray. But the smell wasn't the only unpleasant thing about the room, not by a long shot. For starters, it was ugly as sin. There walls were stained, the bathroom cabinets were missing knobs, and the wallpaper was so hideous that it took every ounce of willpower I had not to gouge my eyes out. I immediately called the front desk to get this sorted out, explaining that there was a mistake and we had not been placed in the room we ordered online. The front desk clerk told me that the hotel was completely booked and there were no available rooms to switch into. She suggested checking back in the morning around 11:00 a.m. to see if there had been any check outs. 11 a.m. rolls around and I am at the front desk checking to see if anything has opened up. Nothing. The clerk tells me there are still no available rooms, but to try back in a few hours. Fast forward and I'm back there again listening to them tell me that there are no rooms and there is nothing they can do. I ask to speak to the manager, and after about 15 minutes of waiting, he comes out of his office to speak with me. The clerks at least pretended like they wanted to help me and were doing everything they could, this guy had a pompous air about him that let me know I was wasting his time before he even said anything. I once again explained my situation, to which he smugly replied that the room choice option on their website was a preference and did not guarantee that the preferred room type would be reserved. Furthermore he told me that the hotel had enough guests to fill the luxury rooms, so he didn't feel inclined to switch us. Then, with the phoniest and most self-satisfied smile I had ever seen, he reiterated that there was nothing more he could do. What kind of bullshit is that? I don't know about you, but when I book a room I assume that the room I booked will be reserved. Feeling defeated, I retired to my room to tell my girlfriend what had happened. But it wasn't over. Later that night, we were getting ready to go to sleep. I was laying on the bed watching TV and she was just stepping into the bathroom when suddenly she released a blood curdling shriek. She screamed so loud I was sure I was about to see a dead body laying there on the bathroom floor. What I saw was worse. Scurrying across the floor was the most enormous cockroach I have ever seen. This thing was HUGE I'm talking the size of a small mouse. After completely losing our shit, my girlfriend and I regrouped to formulate a plan of attack. Our first instinct was to curb stomp the shit out of this vile creature, and send it back to the pits of hell from whence it came. But we resisted these urges in favor of a much more devious plan - bring it to the front desk. I somehow managed to capture the disgusting hell-beast in a plastic cup, and skipped joyfully down to the lobby to speak with the manager. He emerged from his office looking complacent as ever, no doubt prepared to send me packing once again. \\"How can I help y--\\" he began to say as I placed the cup on the counter in front of him. Upon seeing this captured behemoth, his eyes went wide and the smugness left his face faster than you can say \\"la cucaracha.\\" He was utterly petrified, and I was loving every second. Fixated on the cup for a few moments, he looked up at me with a grimace and said \\"I don't like bugs.\\" And without missing a beat my girlfriend replied, \\"Neither do we.\\" The delivery of that line could have been straight out of a movie, almost too good to be unscripted. To his credit, the manager ended up giving us a 40 compensation to eat at one of the hotel restaurants. It didn't make up for our experience but at least it was something. In addition, he MAGICALLY found a luxury room for us to stay in for our final night there. So on one hand that was nice, but also a glaring confirmation that those assholes lied to us about the hotel being completely booked. Overall, I would rate my experience at the Riviera as thoroughly horrendous and would NOT recommend anyone to go there. Ever. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","response":"This review can be described as having an overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The guest experienced a series of issues and inconveniences during their stay at the Riviera, including being given the wrong room, unhelpful staff and management, and encountering a large cockroach in the bathroom.

Although the manager eventually compensated the guest and provided the originally requested room, these actions did not redeem the overall negative experience."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Line a colander with a cheesecloth. Pour your milk into the cloth. Add salt. Hang your cheesecloth for an hour. Add your herbs. Refrigerate the cheese. Article:","response":"Title: A Simple Guide to Making Fresh and Flavorful Homemade Cheese Introduction Cheese making is an age-old practice with historical roots that can be traced back more than 8000 years. Over time, various cultures have perfected the art of cheese making, leading to a diverse assortment of cheese varieties enjoyed across the globe. Despite the vast range of flavors and textures, one aspect remains constant; the satisfaction that comes with making and savoring your own homemade cheese. Let's dive into an easy-to-follow technique to create deliciously fresh and flavorful cheese right in your kitchen. Step-by-Step Cheese Making Process 1. Gather Your Supplies For this recipe, you will need: - A large colander - A cheesecloth (large enough to line your colander) - Fresh milk (whole or 2% milk) - Salt - A selection of fresh herbs (optional) - A clean twine or string to hang your cheesecloth 2. Line Your Colander Begin by lining your colander with the cheesecloth, ensuring that it covers the entire surface area of the colander. 3. Pour Your Milk into the Cloth Slowly pour the milk into the cheesecloth-lined colander. The cheesecloth will serve as a filter, separating the curds (small lumps of cheese) from the whey (liquid by-product). 4. Add Salt Sprinkle salt evenly over the milk in the cheesecloth. Adding salt not only enhances the flavor of the cheese, but it also helps in the preservation process by preventing the growth of unwanted microorganisms. 5. Hang Your Cheesecloth Tie the corners of the cheesecloth together using a twine or string and hang it over a clean bowl or sink for at least an hour. This will allow the whey to drain, leaving you with semi-solid cheese curds inside the cloth. 6. Add Your Herbs (Optional) Once the whey has completely drained, you can customize your cheese by mixing in fresh herbs of your choice. Some popular herb options include chives, basil, dill, and parsley. Combine the herbs with the cheese curds, mixing well to distribute them evenly. 7. Refrigerate the Cheese After adding your herbs, transfer your cheese into an airtight container and refrigerate it for at least six hours. This step will further solidify the cheese and help to blend and enhance the flavors. Conclusion Cheese making may seem like a complex process, but this easy-to-follow guide proves that it can be accomplished with minimal effort and just a few simple ingredients. Enjoy the satisfaction of making and indulging in your own homemade cheese, and feel free to experiment with different herbs and seasonings to create a unique flavor profile that suits your taste buds."},{"question":"How is \\"I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"\\"I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote.\\" can be translated to Romanian as \\"Cred că aceasta ar trebui văzută într-un mod pozitiv și, prin urmare, ar trebui să fie la fel și rezultatul votului.\\" Let's break down the sentence to understand the meaning of each word or phrase: 1. \\"I think\\" - \\"Cred\\" 2. \\"this should be seen\\" - \\"aceasta ar trebui văzută\\" 3. \\"positively\\" - \\"într-un mod pozitiv\\" 4. \\"and therefore\\" - \\"și, prin urmare\\" 5. \\"so should the result of the vote\\" - \\"ar trebui să fie la fel și rezultatul votului\\" In this translation, the speaker expresses their opinion that both the particular issue and the outcome of the vote should be regarded positively. The sentence is structured in a way that emphasizes the connection between the two points, suggesting that if one is viewed positively, the other should be as well. Romanian, like other Romance languages (e.g., French, Spanish, Italian), is characterized by its use of subject pronouns, gendered nouns and adjectives, and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject pronoun (\\"eu,\\" or \\"I\\" in English) is omitted because the verb \\"cred\\" (meaning \\"I think\\" or \\"I believe\\") already conveys the subject. The adjective \\"pozitiv\\" in the phrase \\"într-un mod pozitiv\\" agrees in gender and number with the noun it describes, while the conjunction \\"și\\" (meaning \\"and\\") serves to link related ideas in the sentence. Moreover, the sentence demonstrates the use of the subjunctive mood, which is used to express wishes, possibilities, or hypothetical situations. The verb \\"a trebui\\" (meaning \\"should\\" or \\"must\\") is conjugated in the subjunctive mood and followed by the infinitive form \\"văzută\\" (meaning \\"seen\\" in this context)."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: People tend to be more impressed by evidence that seems to confirm some relationship. Thus many are convinced that their dreams are prophetic because a few have come true; they fail to notice the many that have not. Consider also the belief that \\"the phone always rings when I'm in the shower. \\" If it does ring while you are in the shower, the event will stand out and be remembered. If it doesn't ring, that nonevent probably won't even be remembered. People want to see order, pattern and meaning in the world. Consider, for example, the common belief that things like personal misfortunes, plane crashes, and deaths \\"happen in threes. \\" Such beliefs stem from the tendency of people to allow the third event to define the time period. I if three plane crashes occur in a month, then the period of time that counts as their \\"happening together\\" is one month; if three crashes occur in a year, the period of time is stretched. Flexible end strengthens such beliefs. We also tend to believe what we want to believe. A majority of people think they are more intelligent, more fair-minded and more skilled behind the wheel of an automobile than the average person. Part of the reason we view ourselves so favorably is that we use standards that work to our advantage. As economist Thomas Schelling explains, \\"Everybody ranks himself high in qualities. \\" He values: careful drives give weight to care, skilled drivers give weight to skill, and those who are polite give weight to courtesy. \\" This way everyone ranks high on his own scale.

You can also talk to local beekeepers about where they get their bees so that you can make sure to get quality bees. You can buy bees from sellers on the internet but just be aware that you will not be able to inspect the bees before purchase, so you risk the chance of getting a weak or really new hive. When buying bees you should think about the type of bees you want. There are 4 main types of honey bees to buy: Italians, Caucasians, Carniolans, and hybrids. Italian bees are generally the most popular bee to keep because of the amount of honey they produce. However, Caucasian bees tend to be considered the gentlest of the honey bees and Carniolans tend to be hardy bees that survive the winter well. Bee keepers have also created a variety of hybrid bees that take traits from the other varieties. bees in the spring. Once your hive is all set up you can buy bees and start beekeeping. It's best to do it in the spring, when there will be plenty of food around for the new colony to establish itself. You can also catch a swarm of bees in the wild and introduce them to your hive. These are bees that have outgrown their previous hive and are looking for a new home. However, swarms can typically only be caught in the spring and it can take some skills and patience to populate a hive this way. When you order bees they will come in a package that includes thousands of worker bees and one queen bee. To start the new colony, place the queen in the hive in the container she arrived in. Typically, she will come in a small box that has a small cover you remove. Under the cover she will still be blocked inside by a layer of candy. This candy will be removed by the worker bees over the course of several days, which will allow the queen and workers to get acclimated to each other. Be sure to follow the directions for placing the queen in the hive that comes with the bees. These directions will be specific to the type of packaging your bees came in. Once the queen is in place you can then introduce the bees. Gently tap the container of bees to loosen the clump of them. Then open the cover and pour the bees into the hive. Once the majority of them are in the hive between the frames, put the inner cover and the outer cover on the hive. There will be some bees left in the container. Just set the open container on the outside of the hive and the lingering bees will find their way into the hive. Once you have put the worker bees in the hive, you can put the inner and outer covers on the hive. Summary:","response":"1. Research local, well-respected beekeepers and inquire about purchasing bees from them or their recommendations. 2.

Context: SINGAPORE — What now? That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

In 2011, the president of Chile was Sebastián Piñera, a billionaire businessman who governed the country from 2010 to 2014. His full name is Miguel Juan Sebastián Piñera Echenique. Piñera was born on December 1, 1949, in Santiago, Chile. He is a member of the center-right political party, National Renewal (RN), which is part of the Coalition for Change. Sebastián Piñera holds a degree in commercial engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and a master's degree and PhD in Economics from Harvard University. Before entering politics, he had a successful career in the business world. He held major companies like LAN Airlines, Chilevision, and Blanco y Negro S.A.

One of the key accomplishments of his administration was the successful rescue of the 33 trapped miners in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident. However, his government was also marked by significant student protests demanding education reform along with environmental and social issues.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the last crisis during cold war to escalate world powers?","response":"The last major crisis during the Cold War that escalated tensions among world powers was the Able Archer 83 exercise, which took place in November 1983. This was a realistic NATO military exercise simulating a potential conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, particularly focusing on communication between NATO countries. During the exercise, the Soviet Union misinterpreted the simulation as preparations for an actual nuclear attack on their territory. The heightened alert level and increased military activity on both sides brought the world uncomfortably close to a real confrontation. This event was marked by high levels of tension and mistrust between the superpowers, with both the United States and the Soviet Union fearing that a conflict could spiral into a full-scale war. A contributing factor to this tense atmosphere was the deployment of Pershing II intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the United States in Western Europe earlier that year. This move escalated the arms race and further strained relations between the two superpowers. Additionally, the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union in September 1983 added to the existing tensions. The Able Archer 83 incident exemplifies the delicate nature of the balance of power during the Cold War era and how easily misinterpretation or miscommunication could have led to catastrophic consequences. Fortunately, the exercise ended without any direct military confrontation, and the crisis was ultimately resolved peacefully. It served as an important lesson for both the U.S. and the USSR about the importance of clear communication and the dangers of miscalculations in geopolitics. As a result, it contributed to the ongoing efforts towards diplomatic solutions and arms control negotiations in later years, eventually leading to the end of the Cold War."},{"question":"Haluan korostaa voimakkaasti, että viljelijöille on taattava vakaat ja riittävät tulot vastineeksi heidän kovasta työstään ja siitä, että he toimittavat meille korkealaatuisia tuotteita.

Let c be the total cost of the vacation, and x be the cost per person when divided among 3 people. So, we have the relationship: c = 3x 2. If the total cost had been divided equally among 4 people, the cost per person would have been 60 less. In this scenario, the cost per person is (x - 60). Therefore, we have another relationship: c = 4(x - 60) 3. Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables (c and x): c = 3x c = 4(x - 60) 4.

Now that we have found the value of x, let's use the first equation to find the total cost (c): c = 3x c = 3 * 240 c = 720 The total cost of the vacation is 720. Therefore, the correct answer is: d. 720"},{"question":"Context: After Oakland began the game with a 3-and-out, Denver sustained a long drive deep into Oakland territory. However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6. Kyle Orton had 157 yards passing on 23 attempts with 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions, giving him a respectable 92.1 rating.

The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. Big Star produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \\"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations,\\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \\"quintessential American power pop band,\\" and \\"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\\".Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. During the group's hiatus in the 1980s, the Big Star discography drew renewed attention when R.E.M. and the Replacements, as well as other popular bands, cited the group as an influence. In 1992, interest was... Guess a valid title for it!

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose diaphragm expands for more air happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the proposed perturbation, in which the diaphragm expands more than usual, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of gas exchange, potentially leading to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Direct effects: When the diaphragm expands more than usual, it creates a greater negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. This increased negative pressure can lead to a higher volume of air being inhaled into the lungs. Theoretically, this should result in more oxygen being delivered to the body. However, if the rate of expansion of the diaphragm outpaces the lungs' capacity to expand and the alveoli's ability to perform gas exchange efficiently, it might prevent the oxygen from properly diffusing across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the bloodstream. As a result, an increased diaphragm expansion can potentially lead to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Indirect effects: The increased expansion of the diaphragm can affect other aspects of the respiratory system, which in turn may impact the efficiency of oxygen delivery. For example: 1. Altered ventilation-perfusion ratio: The efficiency of gas exchange depends on the appropriate matching of ventilation (airflow) and perfusion (blood flow) within the lungs. If the diaphragm expands more than normal, it can potentially lead to a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion within the lung regions. This extreme expansion may overinflate some alveoli in the well-ventilated areas, compressing neighboring capillaries and impeding blood flow. At the same time, poorly inflated areas receive reduced airflow. Consequently, oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange decreases, resulting in less oxygen delivery to the body. 2. Respiratory muscle fatigue: If the diaphragm continuously expands more than necessary, it can cause respiratory muscle fatigue over time. This state of fatigue can impair the efficiency of breathing, leading to shallow and rapid breaths, which do not allow sufficient airflow for proper oxygen exchange. Consequently, less oxygen is delivered to the body. 3. Impact on lung compliance and elasticity: The increased diaphragmatic expansion can potentially stress the lung tissue, compromising its compliance and elasticity. By stiffening the lungs, it could make it more difficult for the lungs to expand sufficiently for effective gas exchange, and eventually result in less oxygen delivery to the body. In summary, although the perturbation of the diaphragm expanding more than usual might seem initially beneficial by taking in more air, it can ultimately affect the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the body. Both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory system can occur, including impaired gas exchange, respiratory muscle fatigue, and impact on lung compliance and elasticity. It is essential to maintain proper diaphragmatic expansion and respiratory mechanics for optimal oxygen delivery to the body."},{"question":"Q: What do you call a mixture in which some particles settle out of it when it is left standing?

This can make snoring worse by putting pressure on your partner's diaphragm. Some have recommended sleeping with something uncomfortable, like a tennis ball, sewn into the back of a shirt. This will make it awkward for your partner to sleep on their back and forces them to sleep in another way. Being overweight is a common cause of snoring. The extra weight affects the lungs and neck, making airflow blocked or strained during sleep. Being overweight is not always a cause of snoring, however, it does increase the probability that snoring will occur. Excess body fat will increase the chances of developing sleep apnea. Changing aspects of a lifestyle, such as losing weight, are usually recommended starting points to stop snoring. Have your partner ask your doctor for more information on how you can best lose weight. Nasal strips are an over-the-counter method of improving airflow through the nose. The nasal strip works by slightly pulling open, and keeping open, the nostrils. The improved airflow will help reduce snoring. Falling asleep with the nasal strip on may be unusual at first. Continued use will help your partner get used to the nasal strip. These strips won't be helpful to anyone suffering from sleep apnea because sleep apnea is caused by collapsed soft tissues in the back of the throat. Alcohol consumption and smoking can affect the throat and respiratory systems. Have your partner reduce the use of either to help prevent snoring from occurring. Alcohol causes the neck and tongue to relax which can obstruct airflow. Never drink alcohol right before sleep as this will make snoring worse. Smoking damages the throat and respiratory system. By reducing the amount your partner smokes, the chances of snoring occurring will also be reduced. Remember that snoring is a symptom of some other issue. Have your partner visit your doctor to determine exactly what the cause of their snoring may be. Examine the following list of possibilities to get an idea of what to expect: Nasal blockages. This may be due to chronic congestion or the configuration of your nasal passages, such as a deviated septum. Untreated allergies. Allergies can produce swelling of tissue in the nose and throat, as well as cause mucus production that can make breathing difficult. Obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a potentially serious medical condition that your doctor will want to address. This occurs when your throat tissue blocks your airway and prevents breathing entirely. If other options have not put an end to the snoring, ask your doctor about surgical options. Depending on your partners situation, there are a few different surgeries that may be recommend by your doctor: If your partners palate is the cause of their snoring, their doctor may recommend palatal implants. These are strands of polyester filament that are placed within the soft palate the mouth, which stiffen and prevent snoring. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) may be recommended if your partner has excess or loose tissue in or around the throat. By removing and tightening this tissue, this cause of snoring is eliminated. Laser and radio/sonic based treatments can also be used to shrink any excessive amounts of tissue in the throat. These are both outpatient procedures and are not as invasive as traditional surgery. Summary:","response":"To help your partner stop snoring, make sure they don't sleep on their back, as it can make snoring worse. They can try losing weight if they are overweight because extra fat can cause snoring. They could use nasal strips to help them breathe better at night. Drinking less alcohol and not smoking can also help stop snoring. If the snoring continues, your partner should see a doctor to find out the cause, which may be allergies, a blocked nose, or a condition called sleep apnea. If nothing else works, the doctor might suggest special treatments or surgeries to stop the snoring."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Information: - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research facility primarily located in Bethesda, Maryland.

United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Montgomery County, officially the County of Montgomery, is a county in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2010 census, the population was 971,777, with a 2014 estimate putting the population at 1,030,447. It is the most populous county in Maryland. The county seat and largest municipality is Rockville, although the census-designated place of Germantown is the most populous place. - The Pool of Bethesda is a pool of water in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem, on the path of the Beth Zeta Valley. The fifth chapter of the Gospel of John describes such a pool in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. It is associated with healing. Until the 19th century, there was no evidence outside of Johns Gospel for the existence of this pool; therefore, scholars argued that the gospel was written later, probably by someone without first-hand knowledge of the city of Jerusalem, and that the \\"pool\\" had only a metaphorical, rather than historical, significance. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center and colloquially referred to as the Bethesda Naval Hospital Bethesda, \\"Walter Reed, or Navy Med\\"', is a tri-service military medical center located in the community of Bethesda, Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health. It is one of the most prominent U.S. military medical centers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the United States, having served numerous U.S. presidents since the 20th century. - Claflin is a city in Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 645. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - The Bethesda Meeting House (BMH) is a historic Presbyterian church complex located at Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. It is situated on Maryland Route 355 (known as Rockville Pike at this point) just inside the Capital Beltway. - The Governor of the State of Kansas is the head of state for the State of Kansas, United States. Under the Kansas Constitution, the Governor is also the head of government, serving as the chief executive of the Kansas executive branch, of the government of Kansas. The Governor is the Commander-in-Chief of the Kansas National Guard when not called into Federal use. Despite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses legislative and judicial powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly \\"State of the State\\" addresses to the Kansas Legislature, submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the peace is preserved.

Fiddle farm used and abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm didn't use any of those substances. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm caused more fertilizer to dissolve in the soil because of rain? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","response":"Fiddle farm caused more fertilizer to dissolve in the soil due to rain. The given information states that Fiddle farm used an abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm did not use any of these substances. When it rains, the water dissolves fertilizers in the soil, and the runoff carries the dissolved chemicals away. These dissolved fertilizers, containing high levels of nitrogen, eventually end up in bodies of water, ranging from ponds to oceans. The high concentration of nitrogen in the water causes the excessive growth of algae, leading to algal blooms. As the algae consume carbon dioxide from the water, they produce oxygen during photosynthesis. However, when the algae die, decomposers consume and break down the dead tissue. In this process, the decomposers utilize the dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to a significant depletion of oxygen levels. This decrease in oxygen concentration creates a dead zone in the body of water – an area where there is insufficient oxygen to support the growth and survival of most aquatic life. An example of a large dead zone can be found in the Gulf of Mexico, which results from fertilizer runoff draining from vast agricultural lands in the surrounding U.S. states. From the information given, we can conclude that Fiddle farm, which used a significant amount of fertilizers and pesticides, was responsible for causing more fertilizer to dissolve in the soil due to rain, ultimately leading to environmental issues such as dead zones in nearby bodies of water. Conversely, Park farm, which did not use these substances, contributed less to this issue."},{"question":"Question: Article: Credit cards let people buy things now and pay for them over months or even years.But some people get deep into debt:Some banks have terms and charges that can make it harder for people to pay off that debt.In the United States,there are calls for stronger government supervision of the credit card industry. _ In 2004,Americans had about 800 billion in credit card debt.Now they own about 968 billion.

Printing a photo reel from Katieâs bedroom leads Rachel to the holiday resort Shelter Mountain Inn, where the four students stayed. Rachel discovers the famed videotape and watches it in a rental cabin, discovering it has surreal, gruesome imagery. As soon as the tape ends, the cabinâs telephone rings and a girlâs voice utters âSeven daysâ. Rachel enlists help from Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidanâs father.

The woman tried to put the new bra inside the drawer but the","response":"drawer was too small and cluttered with various other garments, making it incredibly difficult for her to make room for the new addition to her collection. The cramped space was already overflowing with a medley of her essential wardrobe items, ranging from delicate lace undergarments and versatile sports bras to vibrantly colored scarves and comfortable, everyday socks. Each item was meticulously folded and arranged, albeit tightly packed, to optimize the limited space within the small, wooden compartment. In an attempt to accommodate the new bra, she carefully began sifting through the existing contents, evaluating the necessity of each item as she attempted to create a comfortable nook for the pristine undergarment. The bra in her hands was exquisite, gifted to her by a close friend as a symbol of love and support. Crafted from the finest fabric, it boasted intricate floral designs with delicate lace trimmings, making her feel both comfortable and confident when she wore it. The addition of this garment held significant sentimental value, thus adding to her determination to find the ideal place for it within her drawer. As she gently pushed aside a vibrant, patterned scarf, she discovered that by folding it differently, she could maximize the available space and create a small pocket just large enough for the new bra. With steadfast hands, she delicately folded the scarf into a compact square, allowing her to clear the necessary room needed for the new undergarment. Cautiously, she maneuvered the bra into position, taking great care to not disrupt the surrounding items, while ensuring that it maintained its shape and quality. Although the drawer was still exceedingly full, her efforts granted her the ability to accommodate the latest addition to her collection. The color of the new bra blended seamlessly with the assortment of garments within the drawer, creating a visually pleasing arrangement that brought her a sense of contentment. The act of organizing and making room for what mattered most to her reinforced the importance of cherishing cherished possessions and adapting to change, even within the seemingly small and trivial aspects of life. Satisfied with her accomplishment, she carefully closed the drawer, preserving the order within as she went about her day. The memory of this moment would forever serve as a gentle reminder of the value in making room for the things and people that truly matter in life, while also highlighting the need to declutter and reevaluate one's priorities from time to time. In this way, the woman continued to grow and appreciate the process of change and adaptation as she embraced the beauty of life's ever-evolving journey."},{"question":"Sentence from a movie review: all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?

Step 1: Extracting Information about Thomasin McKenzie's career From the context given, we know that Thomasin McKenzie is a New Zealand teen actress who has played various roles, including Pixie Hannah in \\"Shortland Street\\", Astrid in an unidentified work, Lucy Lewis in \\"Lucy Lewis Can't Lose\\", Petra Quince in the webseries \\"Bright Summer Night\\", and an upcoming leading role in the American film \\"My Abandonment\\". Step 2: Assessing the prominence of \\"Shortland Street\\" role The text mentions that she is 'most well known' for playing Pixie Hannah in \\"Shortland Street\\". This immediate association does suggest a high level of recognition for this particular role, which could serve to support the hypothesis. Step 3: Consider other roles The context also spells out various other roles that McKenzie has performed. There is an unstated work where she played Astrid, her role as Lucy Lewis, and a role in the webseries \\"Bright Summer Night\\". It's also mentioned that she has a leading role in an upcoming American film \\"My Abandonment\\". This information could suggest her recognition might be distributed across multiple roles, a factor that might contradict our hypothesis. Step 4: Weighing evidence While the context notes that McKenzie is most well known for her role in \\"Shortland Street\\", it also underlines her engagement in several other works of perceived significance. Without additional data on the success or popularity of each of these works, though, we cannot conclusively draw the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the information given in the context, it's reasonable to assume that Thomasin McKenzie might be most famous for her role in \\"Shortland Street\\".

Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? Hint: Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. The answer to this question is:","response":"Based on the hint provided, the naturally occurring uranium is composed of 99% U-238 and 1% U-235.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did they write? Options: - not enough information - Things they wanted to brainstorm - Things they were thankful for - Things they wanted to ask Answer:","response":"- Things they were thankful for"},{"question":"ind04 admissions, bed-days and hospital patients by region, diagnosis (99 groups), age and sex (2006-2015) Make this proper case","response":"Ind04 Admissions, Bed-Days, and Hospital Patients by Region, Diagnosis (99 Groups), Age, and Sex (2006-2015) The Ind04 dataset is comprised of information regarding admissions, bed-days, and hospital patients between the years 2006 and 2015.

Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest. When we're watching birds, we have to _ . A) look after the birds more often B) use the binoculars to catch the birds C) hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual D) catch the birds at last Answer:","response":"When we find a bird nest, it indeed provides us an excellent opportunity to observe and learn about birds. Since birds take care of their babies and lay eggs between April and June, it's the perfect time for bird-watching. The baby birds are too young to leave the nest, so the parents go out frequently to look for food, returning every few minutes. This behavior makes it easier for us to watch them. While watching birds, it is essential to remain hidden from their view as much as possible. Hiding near the nest and using binoculars to observe them from a close distance allows the birds to continue their natural behavior without disturbance. It is crucial not to disturb the birds while observing them. As for creating a bird nest, a good one has to be made with care, ensuring it is sturdy, thick, and comfortable. Following these steps can help in building an ideal nest: a) Use six boards to construct the nest, which will provide the cover and floor, the left and right sides, and the front and back sides. Make sure the boards are not too slippery, so the birds can comfortably use the nest. b) Carve a small hole in the front of the nest to function as a \\"door\\". Ensure that the entrance is large enough for the birds to fly in and out without difficulty. c) The nest design should prevent rainwater from entering, keeping the inside dry and safe for the birds and their offspring. d) One of the boards should be easy to open, allowing for periodic inspection and maintenance without unnecessarily disrupting the birds. e) Color the nest with natural and non-toxic paint to blend in with the surrounding environment, providing comfort and safety for the birds. When we are watching birds, it is essential to: C) Hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual Choosing this option ensures that we are not causing any disturbance or stress to the birds. As observers, we should minimize any impact on their natural behavior, allowing them to go about their daily activities without disruption. Remember that bird-watching should be a respectful and non-invasive activity that fosters appreciation and understanding for these fascinating creatures."},{"question":"Premise: \\"well that's what i did when i was growing up\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I did that when I was a child.\\" true?

To get the necessary credentials, I had to be personally vetted by producer Gil Cates. As I made my way along the shiny floor of the Oscar production offices, I was prepared for Oz, the great and terrible — at this point, having produced the show 11 times, Cates the Oscars. Instead, I met a man who wore blue jeans and cowboy boots, who twinkled when he smiled and even when he swore. I covered the Oscars from backstage for the next four years; in 2005 and 2006, it was a Cates production — the first time Chris Rock hosted, the second Jon Stewart. Over the years, Cates had orchestrated what many now consider the glory days of the Oscars; he brought us Billy Crystal, Steve Martin and Whoopi Goldberg, overseeing shows that combined over-the-top glamour with a wry sense of insider humor and writing teams that reacted to odd little events within the show (a falling cellphone, Jack Palance's push-ups). Cates considered the Oscars a significant cultural event but understood it was also a television show, two things that did not often lie down easily together. He was a romantic pragmatist. Cates' death Monday at age 77 brought back memories of when I first met him. He was concerned with the turn celebrity journalism was taking, with the pathological love-hate relationship the media, and the public, seemed to have with stars. He believed in the Oscars as a time-honored celebration of American achievement in film, and he wanted it to stay that way. But that was an old Hollywood view, one rooted deeper in storytelling than economics. In subsequent years, studios have all but abandoned mid-level films, and the gap between box office hits and Oscar nominees has grown to Grand Canyon proportions. Fewer people care about the Oscars because fewer people see the movies that win. Meanwhile, more populist award shows have proliferated leading to a rather exhausting \\"awards season.\\" Not surprisingly, Oscar viewership has fallen, and in the last few years, the academy has flailed about trying to reinvent the show, turning to a series of first-time producers, many of them in teams. Some did better than others, but none have managed to recapture the magic that was, in many ways, conjured by Cates. Cates produced his last Oscars in 2008 and the show almost didn't go on — the writers strike ended just weeks before the telecast. It was the second time Stewart hosted and the first I reviewed as a television critic. I thought it was good, all things considered, certainly better than any that have come since. In fact, after the utter failure of the 2011 telecast, I had hoped Cates might be coaxed away from his beloved Geffen and back to the Kodak, and when I spoke with him earlier this year, he seemed amenable. But the academy decided to pair Don Mischer, who co-produced last year, with Brett Ratner, who may not have signed Billy Crystal but did return to the Catesian template for host — a comedian comfortable with large venues, in this case Eddie Murphy. But Cates also brought a matter-of-fact understanding of the show, its strengths and its limitations, that is harder to replicate. \\"It is what it is,\\" he said when we last spoke of the future of the Oscars. \\"It's a big beautiful television show about the movies.\\" The issues that plague it — mercurial economics and demographics at the box office, shifting attitudes toward celebrity, the growing sense of award show fatigue — are not within the ken of a producer's control. \\"Stop worrying about doing something new and do something good,\\" he said with a grin, and more than a few friendly expletives.","response":"The late Gil Cates, renowned producer of the Academy Awards, is remembered for orchestrating the Oscars' glory days by blending glamour with insider humor through hosts like Billy Crystal, Steve Martin, and Whoopi Goldberg. Having produced the show 11 times, Cates understood the Oscars' standing as a cultural event and television show. In recent years, the Oscars have seen a decline in viewership, and no subsequent producers have been able to capture the magic Cates brought to the ceremony."},{"question":"Summarize this article: Make Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts that are dedicated to your stream.

Around 5.3% of middle-school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2015, which is up from 3.9% in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. E-cigarette usage among high school students has hit 16%, and that’s significantly up from the 1.5% who vaped in 2011. Such is the popularity of e-cigarettes, that it has become the most used tobacco product among teenagers, with around 3 million reportedly using then. Overall, around 4.7 million middle and high school students are using any form of tobacco product, and when dissected, roughly one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students use some kind of tobacco product. The study of tobacco usage among youth is important, as while smoking rates have declined in the past decade, 80% of adult smokers first try smoking by the age of 18. What remains unclear, however, is whether vaping leads to smoking. In the CDC’s latest report, the rise in e-cig usage is in tandem with a gradual decrease in the use of normal cigarettes—among all high school students, that has declined from 15.8% in 2011 to 9.3% last year. It provides some proof that e-cigarettes, which are generally regarded as less toxic than cigarettes, may not lead to teens picking up the smoking habit. “We do not have any strong evidence that it is encouraging smoking among kids but neither do we have good evidence that it won’t over time,” Kenneth E. Warner, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan, told the New York Times.","response":"E-cigarette usage among teenagers and pre-teens has risen over the last year, with around 5.3% of middle-school and 16% of high school students using the devices, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data shows that e-cigarettes have grown in popularity among young people, becoming the most used tobacco product: approximately one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students use some kind of tobacco product. While e-cigarette usage has increased, the consumption of conventional cigarettes among high school students has declined from 15.8% in 2011 to 9.3% in 2015."},{"question":"Q:Article: A South African farmer is receiving phone calls from his sheep after equipping them with cell phones to keep tabs on the flock amid recent livestock thefts, according to local press Wednesday. When the sheep call, it is always bad news for farmer Erard Louw of the Cape Town suburbs, as the phones around their necks are only set to switch on when the sheep start running, a sign that thieves have cut through the fences. \\"As they run it gives me a phone call and says 'Sheep One' or 'Sheep Two' and so on, so at least I know where to start looking because the farm is 750 hectares (1,850 acres),\\" Louw told the Cape Times daily. Louw attached the phone-like security device to the collars of four sheep in separate flocks after thieves sneaked in and stole 27 sheep and 13 lambs a couple of weeks ago, driving Louw to _ for ways to protect his animals. He said there was no use calling nearby police, as they were stationed too far away and in his experience they either lacked an available car or the vehicle was out of fuel or missing tyres -- also the work of thieves. According to Louw, the cell phones have already proved their worth, with one sheep-snatcher caught thanks to the device. Still, with theft attempts currently at their peak, given long winter nights and early nightfall, a few sheep-robbers managed to get away in spite of the device. \\"The phone did start ringing that night and I went out,\\" he said, but added that he was too late.

I filled out paperwork and was seated at a table to wait for someone to give me a tour. Shortly after, an employee (Christine) came by to give us the tour. I'm sorry to say, she seemed like she couldn't get us out of there fast enough - it was a quick walk around, pointed out a few things, the end. I had to ask about the tanning (I saw the sign on the very fast tour, but she didn't mention it), I had to ask about class schedules, and about child care.

Jason was naturally healthy, but for Lawrence it was an effort.","response":"Jason was naturally healthy, but for Lawrence, it was an effort. While Jason appeared to be blessed with a strong immune system and a body that seemed to thrive, no matter the circumstances, Lawrence had to invest a significant amount of energy into maintaining even a semblance of the vitality that seemed to come so easily to Jason. Growing up, as brothers only two years apart, Jason and Lawrence exhibited almost polar characteristics. Jason had always been the kind of child who could stuff his face full of junk food and still manage to keep fit, while maintaining a high level of energy. Whenever their mother would take them out for doctor's visits, it was Lawrence who needed the extra care and attention. For Lawrence, being sick was almost routine. He suffered from allergies, lived in constant fear of catching a cold and had to watch his diet to stay healthy. Watching his older brother Jason effortlessly gliding through life without as much as a sneeze was both a fascination and a frustration for Lawrence. It made him envious, sometimes even resentful, because it felt like life was just not fair. Lawrence delved into nutrition, diligently working on crafting a diet that would provide him enough energy and boost his immune system. He discovered that natural whole foods served him best – lots of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. His meals had to be planned meticulously, and he became mindful of both portion sizes and meal timings. In addition to nutrition, exercise was another aspect Lawrence had to work hard on to keep his body functioning optimally. He sought out a personal trainer who helped him develop a customized workout plan, focusing on a balance of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility. As frustrating as it may have been to Lawrence, his diligence, hard work, and commitment to his health turned out to be quite the blessing in disguise. In striving to overcome his challenges, Lawrence developed a level of discipline and persistence that was unmatched. His struggles had shaped him into a more focused, driven, and resilient person, ready to face whatever life threw at him. Meanwhile, Jason's life took a slightly different turn. As he aged, his naturally healthy constitution was no longer enough to save him from the consequences of a less than perfect lifestyle. His unstoppable metabolism started to slow down, and his sedentary habits caught up with him. Luckily for Jason, his little brother Lawrence was there to lend a hand. Seeing his brother's determination and success in living a healthy life, Jason began to seek Lawrence's advice. Lawrence had done so much research and developed such an extensive knowledge on health and wellbeing that he was more than happy to share. Under Lawrence's guidance, Jason began to make conscious choices regarding his nutrition and exercise. As they shared this journey, the brothers grew closer than ever; their relationship fostered in a newfound mutual respect and admiration. In a way, Lawrence's struggles became a source of strength for both of them as they bonded over their pursuit of health and happiness. In the end, the story of Jason and Lawrence illustrates that living a healthy life is not always as effortless as it may seem for some. It requires dedication, focus, and determination. While genetics may play a role in one's predisposition to good health, it is ultimately one's choices and effort that determine overall wellness. Through their individual struggles, these two brothers together were able to embrace healthier lives and cultivate a bond that surpassed any resentment or jealousy that had once existed between them."},{"question":"Definition: In this task you are given a statement and an explanation giving you further knowledge about an entity in the statement.

Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae willingly volunteers for many dangerous missions and is quickly promoted to the rank of Chungsa (Sergeant).

The statement expresses the significant worry that the Parliament should play a constructive and supportive role in Chile's political transition, rather than hindering or undermining the process. The political transition, presumably referring to a shift towards a more democratic or stable system, is of utmost importance in the development and growth of the nation. The speaker highlights that this concern is their third and perhaps most significant one, thus emphasizing the urgency and weight of the responsibility entrusted to the Parliament. This implies that addressing this issue should be a top priority for the members of Parliament to ensure the stability and progress of Chile. In order to make a positive impact on Chile's political transition, it is essential for the Parliament to promote open dialogue, actively include diverse perspectives, and work together towards the creation of policies and decisions that benefit the greater good. By fostering an environment of unity and inclusivity, the Parliament can pave the way for a smoother and swifter political transition that strengthens Chile as a country and improves the quality of life for its citizens. Additionally, it is crucial for the Parliament to establish and adhere to clear principles of transparency, accountability, and human rights protection, ensuring that their actions remain in accordance with democratic values. This, in turn, will set a strong example for other political institutions in Chile and encourage their alignment with the goals of the ongoing transition. Moreover, the Parliament can facilitate the political transition by recognizing and addressing the concerns and needs of the people. By encouraging public engagement in the decision-making process and putting forward policies that cater to the various segments of society, the Parliament has the potential to build trust and promote a more inclusive democracy in Chile. In conclusion, the statement underlines the essential role that the Parliament plays in Chile's political transition and emphasizes the importance of their actions in either strengthening or weakening this process. By promoting unity, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability, as well as actively addressing the concerns of the population, the Parliament can contribute to a more stable, prosperous, and democratic Chile."},{"question":"Write a 1). yelp review (Select from: 1). negative 2). positive).","response":"2). Positive Title: A Remarkable Dining Experience at The Garden Bistro!

We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the staff, and the warm, inviting ambiance of the restaurant. It truly was a remarkable dining experience that deserves every bit of praise it gets. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with a charming setting that immediately felt welcoming and cozy. The soft lighting, tastefully decorated interior, and the gentle music in the background offered a perfect atmosphere for a romantic evening. One of the things that stood out to us was the exquisite menu. The Garden Bistro offers a great variety of dishes to choose from, including mouth-watering appetizers, main courses, and heavenly desserts. As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see the extensive plant-based options available. It was clear that the chefs at the restaurant go above and beyond to ensure fresh, local ingredients are used in every dish. For our starters, we ordered the famous Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms and Truffled Cauliflower Soup. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, filled with a rich and creamy blend of goat cheese and spinach. The soup, meanwhile, offered a delicate balance of flavors, with the truffle oil providing an elegant touch that left us craving for more. As for our main courses, I went with the Wild Mushroom Risotto, while my partner opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna. My risotto was creamy and bursting with the rich umami flavors of the wild mushrooms. The addition of asparagus and fragrant Parmesan cheese elevated the dish to a whole new level. My partner's Ahi Tuna was seared to perfection, creating a beautiful crust around the tender, flavorful fish. The accompanying Mango Salsa and Ginger Soy Glaze complemented the dish wonderfully, rounding out the Asian-inspired flavors. Finally, we couldn't resist indulging in one of their signature desserts, the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake. The cake was moist, warm, and gooey, with a decadent molten chocolate center that oozed out upon breaking through the delicate crust. Paired with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream, it was the perfect ending to our unforgettable meal. Throughout our evening at The Garden Bistro, the service was top-notch. The staff were attentive without being intrusive, and our server was genuinely friendly, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were never empty.

This policy aimed to alleviate the financial burden of education on families, improve access to basic education, increase enrollment rates, and reduce inequality among different socio-economic classes and regions. Kenya's education system before the Free Primary Education policy was characterized by low enrollment rates, high dropouts, and a considerable disparity in access to education based on factors such as socio-economic status, gender, and location. Education was not affordable for a significant portion of the population, and many children were either not attending school or forced to drop out due to financial constraints. The introduction of the FPE policy was a significant milestone in Kenya's education sector as it abolished tuition fees for primary education and allocated funding to primary schools based on student enrollment. This increased public spending on education by the Kenyan government, which was intended to help schools cover the cost of textbooks, teachers, and other essential resources required to provide a basic education. The implementation of the Free Primary Education policy led to a drastic increase in enrollment rates across the country. According to data from the World Bank, the net enrollment rate in primary education rose from 61.6 % in 2000 to about 95 % in 2004. This corresponds to an additional 1.2 million children enrolling in primary education within two years of the policy's introduction. While the introduction of free primary education in Kenya has significantly increased enrollment rates, the policy has also faced several challenges. These include inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of teachers, a lack of learning materials, and an increased demand for secondary education as more students complete primary education. Moreover, issues such as regional disparities and gender inequality still persist in Kenya's educational sector. In conclusion, free primary education in Kenya started in January 2003 as an essential policy intervention to improve access to basic education, increase enrollment, and address socio-economic disparities in the country. While it has had a noteworthy impact on primary school enrollment, various challenges remain, requiring further efforts to ensure equitable, quality education for all Kenyan children."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks...

While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,...

The reigning champions continued their pursuit of a record-extending 21st cup triumph, as they edged closer to yet another domestic double. Match Overview: In a match that displayed the full breadth of Bayern's attacking prowess, Lewandowski gave fans plenty to cheer about with his superb finishing. The Polish international opened the scoring for the visitors with a well-taken header in the first half, and later doubled his tally with a stunning volley. The hosts, Bochum, entered the game as substantial underdogs, and their uphill battle was made all the more difficult following an early sending off. Bochum's rocky journey throughout the match was ultimately compounded by Lewandowski's clinical expertise. Game-Changing Moment: The pivotal moment of the match came in the 20th minute when Bochum's defender was shown a straight red card for a challenge deemed dangerous by the referee. With the home side down to 10 men and facing relentless pressure from Bayern's attack, the chances of a miraculous upset quickly faded away. Lewandowski took full advantage of the situation, and just a few minutes after the red card, he rose highest to head home a pin-point cross from Kingsley Coman. The goal marked the beginning of an unstoppable performance from the 33-year-old forward. Adding Insult to Injury: Looking to compound Bochum's misery, Lewandowski put the result beyond doubt in the second half with an exquisite volley. The striker's second goal showcased his uncanny ability to find the net from seemingly any angle. The goal effectively snuffed out any hopes of a late comeback, ensuring that Bayern Munich comfortably advanced to the following round of the competition. Bochum's valiant effort in a challenging game, although admirable, proved insufficient against the reigning champions. Looking Ahead: With this victory, Bayern Munich solidified their position as the team to beat in the German Cup. Their eyes are firmly set on another domestic double, as they also attempt to maintain their lead at the top of the Bundesliga table. Meanwhile, Bochum will hope to use this experience to strengthen and develop their squad, looking to put in strong performances in their upcoming domestic league games. Conclusion: Bayern Munich's dominance in the German Cup continued, as Robert Lewandowski's deadly double guided them to a commanding victory against a 10-man Bochum side. With the semi-finals on the horizon, fans and pundits alike eagerly anticipate the draw to find out who will challenge the reigning champions en route to the coveted cup.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

Available choices: +make sure the recipe was incorrect +make a good recipe +make a bad recipe The answer is:","response":"+make a good recipe In the context given, Skylar, being a baker, needed to mix all the ingredients for the recipe properly. This is an essential step in baking, where all ingredients must be combined in the correct order and proportions to ensure the final product turns out as intended. Mixing the ingredients properly helps with consistency and facilitates chemical reactions necessary for the baking process. So, Skylar did this in order to make a good recipe. Mistakes in this process could result in the recipe turning out poorly, hence why ensuring that the recipe was incorrect is not a viable answer. Intentionally making a bad recipe is also an unlikely answer, as this would not achieve the goal of baking a tasty and quality product."},{"question":"Question: Information: - The Greenland Sea is a body of water that borders Greenland to the west, the Svalbard archipelago to the east, Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Norwegian Sea and Iceland to the south. The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state.

Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere.

The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness.

Each of these countries has their own reasons for supporting the Syrian regime, despite the allegations of chemical weapon attacks and the devastating impact of the ongoing civil war on Syrian civilians. 1. Russia: Russia has been a long-time ally of Syria, dating back to the Cold War era. As a result, the two countries share a significant history of political, economic, and military cooperation. Russia has various strategic interests in Syria, including its only Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus. In addition, Russia has a vested interest in maintaining a sphere of influence in the Middle East and countering Western influence in the region. Supporting the al-Assad regime allows Russia to maintain a foothold in the area and project its power. Furthermore, Russia sees the conflict in Syria as an opportunity to challenge the concept of Western-backed regime change, fearing a domino effect of such changes on its doorstep. 2. Iran: Iran is another important ally of the Syrian regime. They share a relationship based on mutual interests, including a shared opposition to the United States and Israel. Iran also has religious ties to Syria, as the al-Assad regime is primarily Alawite – a sect related to Shiite Islam, Iran's dominant sect. In the context of the Middle East's broader sectarian tensions, Iran views Syria as a crucial ally and a strategic buffer against Sunni-dominated powers like Saudi Arabia. Iran has invested heavily in the survival of the al-Assad regime, providing financial aid, military assistance, and logistical support. Their continued backing of al-Assad is aimed at preserving Iranian influence and maintaining a key regional partner. 3. China: China's support of the Syrian regime may not be as overt as Russia's or Iran's, but it is nonetheless important. Like Russia, China has a general opposition to Western-backed regime change and military intervention in other countries due to concerns over sovereignty and non-interference. China's support for Syria can be partly seen as a stance against U.S. hegemony, as well as a desire to maintain stability in the Middle East, which has consequences, such as the impact on global oil prices, that affect China's economic interests. Moreover, China has also expressed concerns over the potential rise of extremist groups in Syria if the al-Assad regime falls, fearing the spread of terrorism and instability in the region. In conclusion, while each of these countries has unique reasons for supporting the al-Assad regime, their shared opposition to Western intervention, maintaining influence in the Middle East, and the desire for regional stability ultimately bind them together in continuing to back the Syrian government. This support helps to perpetuate the ongoing conflict and complicates international efforts to find a resolution to the Syrian crisis."},{"question":"Where might a person play an acoustic guitar as they wear headphones and sit in a booth with a window?

The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted July 17-21 among 1,480 adults nationwide finds roughly as many satisfied with the verdict in the case (39%) as dissatisfied (42%), with nearly one-in-five (19%) offering no opinion. More broadly, 52% say race is getting more attention in this case than it deserves, while 36% say the case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed. African Americans express a clear and strong reaction to the case and its meaning: By an 86% to 5% margin, blacks are dissatisfied with Zimmerman’s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin. And nearly eight-in-ten blacks (78%) s ay the case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed. Among whites, more are satisfied (49%) than dissatisfied (30%) with the outcome of the Zimmerman trial. Just 28% of whites say the case raises important issues about race, while twice as many (60%) say the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves. Not only do reactions to the outcome of the case vary widely across racial lines, but overall interest levels also are very different. When asked, in a separate survey, what recent news story they are talking about with friends and family, 63% of blacks volunteer the Zimmerman trial compared with 42% of whites. Nearly six-in-ten African Americans (58%) say they followed news about the verdict and reactions to the case very closely compared with 34% of whites. Young Less Satisfied with Outcome Younger Americans express far more dissatisfaction over the Zimmerman trial verdict than do older Americans. Among those under 30, 53% say they are dissatisfied with t he verdict and just 29% are satisfied. The balance of opinion is the reverse among those ages 65 and older: 50% are satisfied and just 33% dissatisfied. (See the table at the end of this report for a detailed look at opinions about the Zimmerman verdict.) To be sure, some of this reflects the higher share of minorities among younger age groups. But there are sizable age differences in whites’ reactions to the verdict. Among whites younger than 30, as many are satisfied (39%) as dissatisfied (41%) with the Zimmerman verdict. Among whites 50 and older, majorities are satisfied with the verdict (57% of those 50-64, 56% of those 65 and older). Verdict Divides along Partisan Lines Reactions to the Zimmerman verdict are deeply split along partisan lines. A majority of Republicans (61%) express satisfaction with the verdict, compared with 42% of independents and just 22% of Democrats. Partisan differences are nearly as stark among whites: White Republicans are about twice as likely as white Democrats to be satisfied with the verdict (65% vs. 30%). Tea Party Republicans have an especially positive reaction to the verdict in Zimmerman’s trial. Fully 80% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who agree with the Tea Party are satisfied with the verdict, compared with 51% of Republicans and leaners who do not agree with the Tea Party. W hile most white Democrats are unhappy with the verdict, dissatisfaction with the outcome is much broader among black Democrats (91% dissatisfied) than among white Democrats (56% dissatisfied). There also are gender differences in opinions about the Zimmerman verdict. More men are satisfied (44%) than dissatisfied (36%) with the trial’s outcome while women, on balance, are more dissatisfied (48% dissatisfied vs. 35% satisfied). These differences are evident even when the respondent’s race is taken into account. Most Whites Say Too Much Attention on Race About half (52%) of Americans say the issue of race is getting too much attention in this case, while 36% say the case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed. Roughly three-quarters (78%) of blacks say a discussion of race is important, compared with 47% of Hispanics and just 28% of whites. (See the table at the end of this report for a detailed look at opinions about whether the case raises important issue about race that need to be discussed). There is a substantial gender divide in views of race and the Zimmerman case. By nearly two-to-one (57%-29%) men say the issue of race is getting too much attention. But women are evenly divided: 43% say the case raises important issues about race that need to be discussed, while 46% say race is getting too much attention. Most Democrats (62%) say race is an important issue in the case that should be discussed. This is also the view of a smaller majority (53%) of white Democrats. Just 18% of Republicans say the case raises important issues about race that merit further discussion while 68% say the issue of race is getting more attention than it deserves. ||||| George Zimmerman during his trial in Sanford, Fla., on July 12. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) African Americans have a mostly shared and sharply negative reaction to the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the not-guilty verdict in the resulting trial, while whites are far more divided, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. At least eight in 10 African Americans say the shooting of the Florida teenager was unjustified, recoil at the verdict in the trial and want the shooter, George Zimmerman, tried in federal court for violating Martin's civil rights. On the Martin shooting in particular, the racial gaps are extremely wide. Among African Americans, 87 percent say the shooting was unjustified; among whites, just 33 percent say so. A slim majority of whites (51 percent) approve of the not-guilty verdict in the Zimmerman trial, while African Americans overwhelmingly and strongly disapprove. Some 86 percent of blacks disagree with the verdict — almost all of them disapproving \\"strongly.\\" There is also a partisan tinge to the public views. Among whites, 70 percent of Republicans but only 30 percent of Democrats say they approve of the verdict. Some of the reaction to the trial — among both blacks and whites — stems from wildly different views of the role of race in the criminal justice system more broadly. Fully 86 percent of African Americans say blacks and other minorities do not get equal treatment under the law; the number of whites saying so is less than half as large, 41 percent. A majority of whites, 54 percent, say there is equal treatment for minority groups. About eight in 10 African Americans (81 percent) say the federal government should charge Zimmerman in federal court with civil rights violations. Just 27 percent of whites agree, while 59 percent say the government should not bring such charges. Some 60 percent of Hispanics say blacks and other minorities do not receive equal treatment with whites in the criminal justice system, and by a two-to-one ratio, they disapprove of the verdict in the Zimmerman trial. The Post-ABC poll was conducted July 18 to 21 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; it is 4.5 points for the sample of white respondents and 11 points among African Americans and Hispanics. Cohen is Director of Capital Insight, the independent polling group of Washington Post Media. Capital Insight pollsters Scott Clement and Kimberly N. Hines contributed to this report.

The story follows Anne Shirley, an imaginative and intelligent orphan who is mistakenly sent to the Green Gables farm owned by siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, who were actually intending to adopt a boy to help with the farm work. The series is set in the late 19th century, specifically from 1896 onwards. This is established through various references in the source material and the television series, such as historical events, fashion, architecture, and technologies that reflect the era's customs and lifestyle. During this period, the story takes place in the fictional rural village of Avonlea, situated on Prince Edward Island, Canada. This charming, tight-knit community serves as a backdrop to Anne's adventures, friendships, and personal growth throughout the series. The choice of the late 19th century as the setting for \\"Anne with an E\\" is significant due to the social, economic, and technological changes that were taking place in Canada and around the world during this time. These changes impacted the lives of the characters and allowed for several themes related to gender equality, class issues, social norms, and education to be explored throughout the series. In summary, \\"Anne with an E\\" takes place in the late 19th century, starting in 1896, and is set in the fictional village of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, Canada. The time period allows for an exploration of various social issues and creates a rich historical context for the storyline and its characters."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

To achieve this, the EU should revisit the objectives of the 1995 Barcelona spirit, which had accurate goals but lacked political will and proper means. By focusing on good governance, the EU can create opportunities for societies on both shores of the Mediterranean. Stability and prosperity in the region require the support of strong, rather than fierce, states. The EU should abandon its securitisation and economic liberalization approach and instead offer decisive and generous political support for democratic transitions, creating strong Mediterranean partners in the process."},{"question":"Write a text based on \\"us senator to have surgery may miss key votes\\" Text:","response":"Title: US Senator to Undergo Surgery: Potential Impact on Key Votes A prominent United States Senator is scheduled to have surgery in the coming days, which may lead to a temporary absence from Capitol Hill. Consequently, this unforeseen circumstance could result in missed key votes, potentially impacting the balance of power and legislative advancements in the Senate. This news has stirred up discussions about the crucial role each senator plays in shaping the nation's policies and the unforeseen consequences of their absence. The US Senate, composed of 100 members, serves as the legislative body responsible for debating and passing bills that will ultimately become laws. Each senator carries significant influence, and their votes reflect the interests and needs of their constituents. When a senator is unable to attend due to medical emergencies or unforeseen situations, it may have profound consequences on the proceedings and the passage or blocking of essential legislation. The undisclosed senator’s surgery is expected to be non-life-threatening, and a full recovery is anticipated. However, depending on the recovery time and post-operative care, the senator may miss crucial votes in the chamber. During this period, the balance of power could be upended, leading to possible roadblocks in the legislative process. In recent times, the US Senate has been sharply divided, often resulting in legislative gridlocks. In such a polarized environment, every vote counts, and a single absent senator can have far-reaching consequences. The senator's potential absence underscores the importance of each senator's vote and their duty to be present whenever critical decisions are being made. Major legislative items are currently on the Senate's agenda, such as infrastructure investment, climate change mitigation, healthcare reform, and pandemic relief measures. Should the senator miss these critical votes, it could jeopardize the desired outcome for either the Democratic or Republican party, depending on the senator’s party affiliation. As both parties closely monitor the situation, contingency plans are being put in place to minimize the impact of the senator's absence. Moreover, this senator's temporary absence also highlights the importance of representatives maintaining good health and the physical and mental strains that come with serving in public office. Senators are under increasing pressure to be present and engaged on Capitol Hill, resulting in increased stress and workload. This challenging environment necessitates better self-care and awareness, not just for senators but for all individuals involved in the political process. In conclusion, the news of a US Senator undergoing surgery and potentially missing key votes is a stark reminder of the critical role each representative plays in shaping the nation's future. While the outcome of this situation remains uncertain, it prompts a broader conversation about the importance of good health for those serving in public office and the implications of their absence on the legislative process. It is imperative that adequate support, care, and contingency plans be put in place to ensure the smooth functioning of the Senate and the advancement of essential policies for the wellbeing of the American people."},{"question":"In this task, you're given two sentences.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Escape from New York Context: In 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States Government has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A 50-foot (15Â m) containment wall surrounds the island and routes out of Manhattan have been dismantled or mined, while armed helicopters patrol the rivers. In 1997, while travelling to a peace summit between the United States, China and the Soviet Union, Air Force One is hijacked by a terrorist. The President is given a security bracelet, and has a briefcase (containing an audiotape describing a powerful new bomb) handcuffed to his wrist. He makes it to an escape pod, and lands in Manhattan just before Air Force One crashes, killing everyone else aboard. Police officers are dispatched to rescue the President. However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage, and that he will be killed if the police mount any further rescue attempts. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to \\"Snake\\" Plissken, a former Special Forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve in Denver, Colorado: if Snake rescues the President and retrieves the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has him injected with explosives that will rupture Snake's carotid arteries within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time, Hauk will neutralize the explosives. Snake is sent into Manhattan in a stealth glider, landing atop the World Trade Center. He tracks the President's life-monitor bracelet to a vaudeville theatre, only to find it on the wrist of an old man. He meets \\"Cabbie,\\" who takes Snake in his armored taxi cab to Harold \\"Brain\\" Hellman, an advisor to the Duke based in the New York Public Library. Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to unify the gangs in a mass exodus across the heavily-guarded Queensboro Bridge, using the President as a human shield and a map Brain has created to avoid the mines. Snake forces... Answer:","response":"Snake, Brian, Maggie, and the president attempt to use the glider to escape from New York. After learning about the Duke's plan to lead a mass exodus across the heavily-guarded Queensboro Bridge using the President as a human shield, Snake devises an escape plan. He forces Brain and his partner, Maggie, to accompany him on his mission to rescue the President. The group manages to rescue the President and recover the audiotape, and they attempt to escape from Manhattan using the stealth glider that Snake had initially used to enter the island. However, due to various obstacles and hindrances, the glider becomes damaged and unusable. Now left with no other options, the group is forced to improvise and find an alternative way to get the President and the audiotape to safety. They decide to join the Duke's mass exodus across the Queensboro Bridge, taking advantage of the situation to blend in with the other convicts and hoping that they can avoid any confrontations with the Duke and his gang. During their daring escape, they face gunfire, explosions, and attacks from the Duke's men, but they ultimately manage to make it across the bridge. Snake engages in a deadly confrontation with the Duke, defeating him and ensuring the President's safety. In the end, Snake delivers the President and the audiotape to Commissioner Hauk, who stays true to his promise and neutralizes the explosives that were injected into Snake's carotid arteries. Their improvised escape plan proves successful, and Snake, Brian, Maggie, and the President manage to escape from New York despite the seemingly insurmountable odds."},{"question":"Je pensais juste que le débat durait depuis trop longtemps.

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. Question: \\"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services?

Options: - get drunk - meet new people - drinking beer - enjoy yourself - having sex Explain why a human would choose \\"having sex\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","response":"Some people might choose \\"having sex\\" as the answer for several reasons: 1. It matches sexual stereotypes: Throughout various forms of media and societal expectations, there are pervasive messages indicating that heterosexual men and women who meet at parties often engage in sexual activities. While this may not always be the case, one might select 'having sex' in response to this question due to the cultural conditioning and stereotypes involving party scenarios. 2. Company with the opposite sex: The question specifies \\"going to party with the opposite sex\\". A mixture of alcohol and social interaction could lead to intimate connections, and hence, the notion of sex comes up. While 'meet new people', 'get drunk', 'drinking beer', 'enjoy yourself' are all plausible outcomes, some individuals may interpret 'going to party with the opposite sex' as intending to cultivate a more intimate, possibly sexual connection. 3. Interpretation of 'lead to': The precise definition of the phrase 'lead to' might impact someone's response. 'Lead to' implies a somewhat expected or usual outcome, and given the cultural norms and interpretations, some might interpret this outcome to be sex, as it might seem to be the 'end goal' in such a context. Remember, it's also important to note that the perception of the scenario and the answer choice highly depends on the person's upbringing, cultural values, personal experiences, and morals."},{"question":"Add punctuation: One measure for vertical light is called cylindrical illuminance","response":"One measure for vertical light is called cylindrical illuminance.

The first two days of a hearing regarding the order were held in Kent County (Del.) Family Court in December. According to ESPN, Driscoll testified that Busch was \\"unstable and struggling with alcoholism and depression,\\" among other things. The second two-day portion of the hearing concluded today, and Busch dropped a bombshell with his testimony: he claimed Driscoll is a trained assassin. According to Busch, Driscoll told him stories about her super secret assassin missions, and he was even with her one night when he thinks she committed a killing. Via AP: Busch said Driscoll repeatedly asserted her assassin status and claimed the work took her on missions across Central and South America and Africa. He recounted a time they were in El Paso, Texas, when Driscoll left in camouflage gear only to return later wearing a trench coat over an evening gown covered with blood. Busch said that, a day earlier, Driscoll told him she was a mercenary who killed people for a living and had shown him pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds. Busch said Driscoll had claimed that a female character in \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" a film depicting the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a composite of her and other women. Apparently Busch shared his secret with his friends and they were skeptical, but it wasn't enough to dissuade him. Via The News Journal: Driscoll's alleged background as a trained assassin who had experience killing drug lords via long-range sniper rifles and close combat tactics – including the use of knives and poison – became a major talking point during the latter stages of the hearing. On both Monday and Tuesday, Busch said he still believes Driscoll is a trained assassin, despite some of his doubts and questioning by friends. \\"Everyone on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived it on the inside...,\\" Busch testified. \\"Sorry I'm the last one to the party.\\" The News Journal reports that \\"neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted the claims during the hearing,\\" but afterwards AP talked to her on the phone and she denied the allegations, saying that Busch's own attorney Rusty Hardin (who also represented Adrian Peterson when he faced child abuse charges) doesn't believe them: \\"These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,\\" Driscoll said. \\"Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.\\" \\"I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,\\" Driscoll added. Driscoll has an interesting background that makes Busch's assassin claims seem at least vaguely plausible. One of her jobs is as the president of the Armed Forces Foundation, a non-profit that seeks to improve the health of military service members. But she's also the owner of a defense contractor called Frontline Defense Systems that provides military equipment to the government and private companies. Advertisement There is a kind of insane video on YouTube titled \\"Pocket Commando,\\" that is a reality TV-style mini-documentary about Driscoll's life—it's unclear if Driscoll commissioned the video or why it was shot. In the video she dresses her kid up head-to-toe in war gear and says she is \\"commando mommy\\" as far as he is concerned, she goes to a gun range, an employee of hers (at the AFF) says one of her nicknames is Baby Rambo, and other employees rip her naked out of bed at a NASCAR event. Back in November TMZ reported that Busch's lawyers were planning to introduce the video as evidence in the protection order hearing, though I haven't read any news stories that confirm they did. TMZ also reported at that time that \\"Busch's attorneys will argue that Driscoll is a 'trained assassin' who would have no reason to fear Busch.\\" It sounded like an unlikely legal strategy at the time, but I guess Driscoll isn't the worst candidate to be moonlighting as an assassin. Of course, even if Driscoll is an assassin, it doesn't mean Kurt Busch didn't slam her head against the wall. [AP/ The News Journal] Photo via Jerry Markland/Getty ||||| DOVER, Del. (AP) — The NASCAR driver known as \\"The Outlaw\\" said he believes his ex-girlfriend is a trained assassin who was dispatched on covert missions around the world once returned to him in a blood-splattered gown. FILE - In this May 17, 2014 file photo, Kurt Busch walks with his girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, after arriving for the NASCAR Sprint All-Star auto race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. A... (Associated Press) Kurt Busch appeared in court again Tuesday over Patricia Driscoll's request for a no-contact order. \\"Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,\\" Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer. In an interview late Tuesday, Driscoll called Busch's assertion \\"ludicrous,\\" saying he took it \\"straight from a fictional movie script\\" she has been working on for eight years and that he has proofread. In court, Busch continued the push of his legal team to discredit his ex as a scorned woman out to destroy his career, portraying her as a character fit for a screenplay. Busch said Driscoll repeatedly asserted her assassin status and claimed the work took her on missions across Central and South America and Africa. He recounted one time when the couple was in El Paso, Texas. He said Driscoll left in camouflage gear only to return later wearing a trench coat over an evening gown covered with blood. A day earlier, Busch said his ex-girlfriend told him she was a mercenary who killed people for a living and had shown him pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds. Busch said Tuesday that Driscoll had claimed that a female character in \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" a film depicting the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a composite of her and other women. Last month, Michael Doncheff, who served as a personal assistant to Busch and Driscoll, said an ailing Driscoll told him in September that she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border, a story Doncheff considered \\"far-fetched.\\" Doncheff said Driscoll also asserted that she was a trained assassin for the U.S. government and once told him, \\"I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.\\" During the hearing, which stretched over four days, neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted the testimony. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press late Tuesday, Driscoll dismissed Busch's assertions. \\"These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,\\" Driscoll said. \\"Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.\\" \\"I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,\\" Driscoll added. Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing. Driscoll said Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway a week later, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, cross-examined Busch on Tuesday, but few of her questions dealt directly with the assault allegations. Busch has testified that he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave after she showed up unannounced at his motorhome, finally cupping her cheeks in his hands, looking her in the eye and telling her she had to go. \\"He advised that her head tapped the wall as he was doing that,\\" Detective James Wood testified Tuesday, recounting Busch's interview with Dover police in November. Richard Andrew Sniffen, a Christian music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events and befriended Busch and Driscoll, said Driscoll told him on the night of the alleged assault only that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. Sniffen said Driscoll was upset, angry and brokenhearted, but that she never said she was afraid of Busch and seemed intent on reconciling. That attitude shifted in the weeks that followed, Sniffen said, with Driscoll going \\"from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.\\" \\"I will destroy him,\\" Sniffen said Driscoll told him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down. A court ruling on Driscoll's request for a no-contact order is expected later this month or in early February. ||||| For the house. On the house. Loading...

(Photo: JASON MINTO/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo It could be weeks before the court issues a final decision on a protection order filed against NASCAR's Kurt Busch, after a four-day hearing ended Tuesday afternoon. Testimony has covered everything from the assassinations of drug lords to the inner workings of the motorsport industry. Commissioner David Jones said he would issue his opinion and rule on the protection order after receiving additional transcripts and the closing summations from both attorneys, which are due in two weeks. Busch's ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, has accused the driver of slamming her head three times against the bedroom wall of his motorhome. Carolyn McNeice, Driscoll's attorney, said Tuesday that the length of the hearing, two days in December and two this week, was a surprise. \\"I think the parties need to get this finished,\\" she said. \\"Everyone wants to know what is going to happen.\\" Driscoll declined to comment after the hearing Tuesday. Busch and his attorney, Rusty Hardin, have staunchly denied the accusations and cast Driscoll, who runs the Armed Forces Foundation and her own defense company, as a jilted lover who wants to destroy Busch's reputation. They have argued that Driscoll, who Busch claimed is a trained assassin deployed on many missions, was never physically abused. \\"I'm just glad that the truth got told and that we'll wait on the commissioner's decision,\\" Busch told reporters outside of Kent County Family Court on Tuesday. Driscoll's alleged background as a trained assassin who had experience killing drug lords via long-range sniper rifles and close combat tactics – including the use of knives and poison – became a major talking point during the latter stages of the hearing. On both Monday and Tuesday, Busch said he still believes Driscoll is a trained assassin, despite some of his doubts and questioning by friends. \\"Everyone on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived it on the inside...,\\" Busch testified. \\"Sorry I'm the last one to the party.\\" Busch offered up specific examples of her returning from missions, sometimes with bruises. Once, he said, they were in El Paso, Texas, where Driscoll had left that night in camouflage and boots. She returned later to the hotel at which he was staying wearing a trench coat. Under it she was wearing an evening gown splattered with blood and other matter, Busch testified. Neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted the claims during the hearing. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press late Tuesday, Driscoll dismissed Busch's assertions. \\"These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,\\" Driscoll said. \\"Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.\\" \\"I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,\\" Driscoll added. Also on the stand Tuesday was Richard Sniffen, a music minister who did work with NASCAR and knew both Busch and Driscoll. He said Driscoll called him the night of the alleged incident and said Busch had pushed her, and she had hit her head. Sniffen testified that Driscoll called the alleged incident an assault, but never said that she was afraid of Busch. He also testified that over time, her tone had changed in their discussions about the incident. Sniffen testified that Driscoll had said, \\"I will destroy him.\\" However in text messages between the two, read in court, Driscoll denied she said anything like that to Sniffen. On the night of the alleged assault, Driscoll said she went to Busch's motorhome after she received what she said was an alarming text from the driver. The two had a fight the weekend prior and had not spoken since. But Busch and his legal team contended that Driscoll and her 9-year-old son showed up uninvited and unannounced. After an exchange between the two in the motor home, Driscoll alleged Busch slammed her head against the wall three times, injuring the back of her head and her neck. Busch contended that he never slammed her head, never grabbed her by the throat or pushed her head against the wall. Instead, he says he cupped her face and told her to leave. In November, Driscoll reported the incident to police; the protective order was filed around the same time. Dover Police Detective James Wood, who investigated the complaint, said Tuesday that during the police interview Busch had said that he cupped his hands around her face, as if they were going to kiss, and told her to leave. As he did that, her head tapped the wall, Wood said on the stand. The police investigation concluded before Christmas and the Delaware Attorney General's office is currently reviewing the findings.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why is the narrator out fishing ?","response":"The passage does not provide a direct reason why the narrator is out fishing. However, it mentions that \\"Mad was at her parents house\\", which could suggest that the narrator had some free time in her absence. Therefore, one could infer that the narrator might have chosen to go fishing during this free time. It's important to note that fishing isn't necessarily connected with any specific event from the text, like the job offer, but it seems to be an activity the narrator pursues independently. Therefore, my step-by-step reasoning would be: 1. Identify the mention of the narrator going fishing. 2. Assess the context in which the activity occurred. 3. Note that the activity took place when 'Mad' was away. 4. Inference: The narrator utilized this free time by going fishing, presumably as a way to relax or enjoy their hobby.

Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\".

Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman.

The objective is to start a regular \\"Bible study\\" with any person who is not already a member, with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members.

They deal with different topics and concerns. The first question is about a parenting issue and seeking advice on how to encourage a child to stop sucking their thumb. The second question is asking for an explanation of a philosophical phrase. I will address both questions separately. 1) How can I stop my kid from sucking his thumb? Step 1: Understand the behavior Children often suck their thumbs as a way to self-soothe, especially if they are tired, feeling stressed, or trying to cope with anxiety. Recognizing the reason behind the behavior will help in addressing it. Step 2: Encourage communication If the child is old enough, try to have a conversation about why they suck their thumb and discuss alternative soothing strategies or coping mechanisms. Step 3: Find alternative methods of comfort Introduce alternative coping or comfort strategies such as stress toys, cute band-aids/coverings, or rewards for not reverting to the habit. Step 4: Positive reinforcement Praise and encourage your child when they resist the urge to suck their thumb. This will help instill a sense of pride and accomplishment in breaking the habit. Step 5: Be patient Breaking a habit takes time, and every child is different. Stay supportive and patient throughout the process. 2) The meaning of \\"the world is not a wish-granting factory\\" This phrase suggests that one cannot simply wish for something and have it instantly come true in the world. It is a reminder that reality doesn't always work in accordance with our desires, and we must often work hard, overcome challenges, and make compromises to achieve our goals.

Sentence A: \\"I'm going to walk to school because I'm in a hurry\\" - Key concepts mentioned in this sentence: \\"walk to school\\" and \\"in a hurry\\". - Walking to school is a relatively slower mode of transportation compared to driving or taking public transport. Expressing that one is in a hurry implies the need to take the quickest way to get to the destination. - This sentence may seem contradictory because walking takes longer than other methods of transportation, which could be problematic for someone in a hurry. 2. Sentence B: \\"I'm going to school by bus because I'm in a hurry\\" - Key concepts mentioned in this sentence: \\"going to school by bus\\" and \\"in a hurry\\". - Going to school by bus can be a quick and efficient method of transportation, especially if there's a direct or well-planned route available.

Many in the public sphere have raised concerns regarding the safety and operational readiness of these vessels, given the potential implications for national defense and the servicemen and women in uniform who bravely step aboard these crafts. Despite the contentious nature of this issue, an unwavering sense of confidence and trust in the submarines' performance has been steadfastly maintained, thanks to the strong backing by the Chief of Canada's maritime defence staff. It is essential to recognize that the Chief of Canada's maritime defence staff remains committed to ensuring these submarines are in a state of readiness before they are deployed. This process involves thorough preliminary preparations and comprehensive evaluations to guarantee optimal functioning and safe operation. This extensive qualitative approach stands firm as the guiding principle within the organization, cementing the belief that no vessel will leave without being meticulously \\"prepared, checked, and tested.\\" A crucial aspect of the readiness process involves routine and rigorous inspections of the submarines. Such assessments are conducted by highly skilled and specialized teams, capable of examining a wide range of mechanical and electrical components to detect and rectify any potential issues before a submarine enters active service. Additionally, inspection teams are continuously updated with new information and technological advancements to maintain the highest standards of evaluation. Furthermore, the Chief of Canada's maritime defence staff emphasizes the significance of advanced testing for each submarine. The testing process includes a series of in-depth sea trials and simulations to ensure that the vessel can effectively carry out its designated missions and withstand harsh maritime conditions. This comprehensive evaluation framework encompasses a diverse set of exercises, such as analyzing the submarines' underwater capabilities, communication systems, and weapons capabilities, while also assessing the performance and resilience of their crews. Advanced testing also includes preparing the submarines for various potential challenges within the modern maritime domain. Detecting and monitoring threats, as well as crafting appropriate responses, are critical aspects of submarine operations. By engaging in periodic testing and refining procedures in response to evolving threats and advancements in technology, the submarines are continually improved and adapted to perform their role effectively. The Chief of Canada's maritime defence staff wholeheartedly advocates for the submarines procured from the British navy, assuring that they will not be deployed unless they have successfully completed the necessary preparation, inspection, and testing requirements. This statement of confidence reflects the dedication to ensuring that these vessels remain potent, effective tools in the arsenal of Canada's national defence strategy. In conclusion, the steadfast support from the Chief of Canada's maritime defence staff bolsters faith in the British submarines, asserting that they would always be properly prepared, meticulously checked, and rigorously tested to guarantee optimal functionality and safety. By adhering to these stringent standards, Canada can put forth a formidable maritime defence force, safeguarding its shores, and protecting its citizens, all while fostering international security and cooperation."},{"question":"Mozart's Requiem was sung at the funeral; the soloists were the soprano Jeanne-Anais Castellan, the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No. 4 in E minor and No. 6 in B minor were also played.

Q: Abstract: Symptomatic assessment and oesophageal investigations were done in 25 consecutive patients with the irritable bowel syndrome attending a gastroenterological clinic. Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux, dysphagia, and a globus sensation were significantly commoner than in a control group of fracture clinic patients. Ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring showed clearly abnormal reflux in 11 of 22 patients (50%). Nine patients had macroscopic endoscopic changes and a further 11 biopsy changes alone, of oesophagitis which was thus present in 80% overall. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly less in irritable bowel patients than in age and sex matched controls, but upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was comparable in the two groups and disordered peristalsis was not found. Oesophageal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome are mainly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux predisposed to by a subnormal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, rather than by oesophageal spasm. Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data? A:","response":"Yes, the abstract contains numerical data. Step-by-step justification: 1. The study involved 25 consecutive patients with irritable bowel syndrome. 2. The abstract compares the symptoms of these patients to a control group of fracture clinic patients. 3.

Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. When we compare the premise and hypothesis, we see that they describe contrasting situations. In the premise, the person hesitated and refrained from attending the course at the last moment. In contrast, the hypothesis claims that the person has never hesitated to attend the course. Since the premise and hypothesis describe distinct situations, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

He has three younger brothers, Daniel, William, and Stephen, who also became actors. He also has two sisters, Beth and Jane. Alec and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics. Baldwin made his Broadway debut in 1986 in a revival of Joe Orton's Loot alongside Zoe Wanamaker, Zeljko Ivanek, Joseph Maher, and Charles Keating. This production closed after three months. His other Broadway credits include Caryl Churchill's Serious Money with Kate Nelligan and a revival of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, for which his performance as Stanley Kowalski garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. Baldwin also received an Emmy nomination for the 1995 television version of the production, in which both he and Jessica Lange reprised their roles, alongside John Goodman and Diane Lane. In 1998, Baldwin played the title role in Macbeth at The Public Theater alongside Angela Bassett and Liev Schreiber in a production directed by George C. Wolfe. In 2004, Baldwin starred in a revival of Broadway's Twentieth Century about a successful and egomaniacal Broadway director (Baldwin), who has transformed a chorus girl (Anne Heche) into a leading lady. On June 9, 2005, he appeared in a concert version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific at Carnegie Hall. He starred as Luther Billis, alongside Reba McEntire as Nellie and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile. The production was taped and telecast by PBS on April 26, 2006. In 2006, Baldwin made theater news in Roundabout Theatre Company's Off-Broadway revival of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr. Sloane. In 2010, Baldwin starred opposite Sam Underwood in a critically acclaimed revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus, directed by Tony Walton at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York. Baldwin has returned to Broadway as Harold in Orphans.

Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology.

Article: Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time.

What do you think makes a good principal? Join the conversation below. When word got out in the fall that Public School 277 in the Bronx had landed on a list of schools that could be closed by the Department of Education because it had received an F on its progress report, the school’s students, parents and teachers went on a campaign to convince officials that their school had been working hard to raise achievement in the struggling neighborhood. They wrote letters. They crowded into meetings at the school auditorium. They described a school where students are engaged and teachers feel respected for their work. In December, when they learned that school officials had decided to keep the school open, “you could hear the resounding cheer throughout the school,’’ said Cheryl Tyler, the principal. Deputy Chancellor Marc Sternberg said, “We saw the school has a motivated principal and energized staff with a vision for improving student achievement.” Ms. Tyler, 64, who became a teacher in 1970, said she knows there is much work ahead. Her school, located in a cheerfully decorated building, has 529 students, 40 percent of whom are considered English language learners or classified as special education students. Ms. Tyler’s salary is 133,000 a year. You came here in 2006. What was the school like then? There was a very different vision of the school. Most of the teachers felt that their work was to ensure that kids were quiet and compliant and contained. And because of that — kids are very smart — many of the kids weren’t engaged. I think that the curriculum was not a curriculum that really mattered to the kids. It was certainly a school that had done some important work and some effective work and needed a coherent curriculum, and teachers needed to find a place that they felt they were really making a difference for the kids. And how would you describe P.S. 277 now? What I like to think now is that we’ve become a community of ideas. When we have a problem now, or we’re in some kind of crisis mode, we come together as a community. We think about it, we learn from that crisis and we try to figure out ways together to resolve it, because separately we cannot make our school better. Did you choose to come to this school? I did. I came out of the Leadership Academy. One of the goals of the Leadership Academy is to put their graduates in schools that are in need. Over my career I’ve taught in Harlem and the Upper West Side, and I’ve always felt that the important work — it’s all important work — but the really important work was teaching in Harlem, being in the South Bronx, being in the high poverty neighborhoods of Buffalo when I was in Teacher Corps. You got an F on your school progress report, after earning an A in 2009 and a C in 2010. How hard was it to hear that your school might close because of poor performance? It was devastating. It was devastating on a lot of levels. We know as a community what our kids are doing. We know how incredibly important those standardized tests are. We also know that it’s not enough for our kids to answer other people’s questions. We want them to be the ones asking the questions. We want them to also have the skills and the strategies and the kind of thinking that they need when those answers don’t make sense, to push back. Here, they’re always analyzing, they’re always theorizing, they’re always determining the validity of an argument. That’s really what we know our kids are doing. You see them in the morning with their noses in books. So it was devastating because we are working very hard to figure out what’s happening when our kids are taking those standardized tests because we know that they’re capable and we know that our teaching is effective and strong and powerful. They were devastated and constantly asking themselves: “What are we going to do? How are we going to ensure that the rest of the world sees us in light of what we’re doing because our test scores do not reflect the work that we’re doing.” What are you doing about that? We analyzed the data. We looked at our monthly assessments. We looked at our students’ writing, we hold it next to a rubric, we look at reading levels monthly. We look at math assessments monthly, and our social studies and science assessments in the context of common core standards. So we found a couple of things. One of the things, and this was a citywide pattern, but our kids in particular, need more work with nonfiction. We’ve implemented an additional half-hour a day of nonfiction, or reading in content in social studies. We’ve been given a gift of 8,000 nonfiction books by the Reading and Writing Project at Teachers College. Isn’t that throwing a lot at the problem? Every child is reading at a different level. For example, the fourth grade is studying civil rights. We don’t use textbooks, so we have to make sure that every child in the fourth grade has a book on his or her level, and not just one, but several. So it does seem like a lot, but you might need 20 books for one child. No, and the reason is that they’re ineffective when children are not all reading at the same level. You also said you’re doing more whole book assessments. What were you doing before? We were assessing our kids with short passages and asking them to retell the passage and to do inference work, and they were at grade level. But when it came to taking the test, they weren’t. We learned that the short text gave us a picture, but it wasn’t enough. We know a certain student, for example, can read two pages, and we know he can retell it and he can do some inferential work and theories about character development. What we didn’t know is whether in these books, can he accumulate information from chapter to chapter? Is he developing ideas as he moves through the chapters? Is he able to develop theories about characters? Those things now are being measured because we’re reading whole books. Have your methods changed? Is professional development more intense? One of the things we’re looking very closely at is I.E.P.-Special Education students and English Language Learners. Our children in general education were performing at about the city average on multiple choice questions. It’s our children who have I.E.P.’s (Individual Educational Plans) and the E.L.L.’s who we really, really need to take a close look at. That counts for 40 percent of our population. All our teachers are receiving really, really high-quality professional development from Teachers College and we have staff developers from there, and Lucy Calkins is deeply committed to our school; in fact she’s the one who sent us the 8,000 books. (Editor’s note: Lucy Calkins is the founding director of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project.) What did it take to convince D.O.E. not to shut you down? I didn’t do anything except make it very clear to people that we had something worth fighting for, and I think they all believed that. Teachers are here because they see something bigger. They see that what we’re doing is not just teaching, that it’s more than just a job. They’re committed to something bigger. They felt that and there was an outpouring of e-mails. Some of the teachers’ parents even wrote. They said how proud they were of their kids and how committed their children were to being here and to the school and to the community. The people who supervise some of our student teachers from Teachers College wrote letters too, and parents and students wrote letters, too. You were devastated at first. Has that turned into a feeling of determination? You said it perfectly. We’re extraordinarily relieved and grateful that the work we’re doing is appreciated and that it was seen. We were under a lot of scrutiny and we felt that people really understood what we were doing, the people who were making those decisions.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, I will analyze the information provided in both sentences: Step 1: Identify the main ideas in each sentence. - Sentence 1: Fee exists, facilities are good - Sentence 2: Fee is 350€, the amount is high Step 2: Compare the main ideas to see if there is a logical connection. - Both sentences mention a fee, but the first sentence only states that there is a fee without specifying the amount. The second sentence says the fee is 350€ and that it is quite high. Step 3: Determine if one sentence entails the other. - The first sentence mentions a fee and the quality of the facilities, but it does not give any information about the fee's amount or its relative value (high, low, etc.). The second sentence provides additional information about the fee amount and its perceived value in comparison to other fees. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence.

Please answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Understanding the question The user is asking if Leafhoppers, which are insects, compete with producers of Log Cabin syrup, a commercial syrup brand, for any resources. This question involves understanding the life cycle of Leafhoppers, their impact on the resources relevant to Log Cabin syrup, and the extraction process involved in producing the syrup. Step 2: Identifying the resources used by Log Cabin syrup producers Log Cabin syrup is a commercial syrup brand, and while it is usually associated with maple syrup, it is predominantly made from corn syrup instead of authentic maple syrup. The primary resources needed for the production of Log Cabin syrup are corn and the necessary ingredients to manufacture corn syrup. Step 3: Researching the life cycle and habitat of Leafhoppers Leafhoppers are small insects that belong to the family Cicadellidae and are commonly found on plants, feeding on the sap. These insects typically thrive on a variety of plants, including grasses, shrubs, and trees. Step 4: Identifying any overlap in resources There is no overlap between the food sources for Leafhoppers and the primary resources needed for the production of Log Cabin syrup, as Leafhoppers feed on plant sap and do not have a direct connection to corn production. However, they can still be potential agricultural pests on various crops, including corn. Their feeding causes minimal direct damage to corn plants; however, they can transmit diseases that may be harmful to the crops. Step 5: Assessing the competition for resources Based on the information analyzed above, Leafhoppers may have an indirect impact on corn crops due to their potential to transmit diseases. However, this impact is minimal and not significant enough to constitute a competition for resources between Leafhoppers and Log Cabin syrup producers. Conclusion: Leafhoppers do not significantly compete with Log Cabin syrup producers for resources. While they can potentially have a minor indirect impact on corn crops, it is not directly related to the primary resources needed for producing Log Cabin syrup, which uses corn and corn syrup."},{"question":"where is the roting number on a check??","response":"The routing number on a check is a nine-digit number found at the bottom left corner of the check, just before the account number. This number is unique to the financial institution that issued the check and is used to identify the bank for the purpose of processing transactions. Here's a detailed description of the routing number and how to locate it on a check: 1. Turn the check over and look for the bottom edge, where you will usually find one or more sets of numbers printed in magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) format. 2. The first set of numbers, in the bottom left corner of the check, is the routing number. It is enclosed by two symbols that look like a vertical line followed by a colon (|:). The symbols are there to separate the routing number from other numbers on the check. 3. The routing number consists of nine digits. The first four digits represent the Federal Reserve Bank district where the bank is located. The next four digits indicate the financial institution itself, and the last digit is a check digit, calculated using an algorithm to verify the routing number's validity. 4. Right after the routing number, you'll see another set of numbers that is usually longer (10-12 digits). This is the account number, which is unique to the specific account holder and is used to identify the account that the check is drawn from. 5. There may be another shorter set of numbers, usually consisting of 3 to 4 digits, located to the right of the account number. This is the check number, which matches the number you see on the top right corner of the check. It helps to keep track of the checks you write and it assists the bank in processing the check correctly. Understanding the routing number is critical when setting up direct deposits, automatic bill payments, or transferring money between bank accounts. Always ensure you provide the correct routing number when required to avoid any delays or issues with your transactions. In case you are unsure about the routing number, you can verify it by contacting your bank or checking your bank's website."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

The roll control of the airplane passes for a start to the control tower (engl. tower). In this text, we can observe multiple terms and ideas related to aviation and vehicle control. Let's break them down and explain their meanings in more detail: 1. In the run-up: This phrase indicates the period leading up to a specific event or action, such as the preparation of an aircraft or vehicle for takeoff or operation. 2. Movements of aircraft and vehicles: This phrase refers to the motion or positioning of various forms of transportation, either in the air (aircraft) or on the ground (vehicles). 3. Roll control (engl. ground control): Roll control refers to the system of managing the rotation or rolling movement of an aircraft or vehicle, which is essential in maneuvering and maintaining stability. The term \\"ground control\\" is used in a similar context but typically relates to different aspects of aviation management, including communication and direction between air traffic controllers and pilots as well as the overall monitoring of airport operations. 4. Monitored visually and by radar: This phrase highlights that both manual observation and technological systems are used to keep track of the movements and roll control of these vehicles. 5. The roll control of the airplane passes for a start: This part of the text indicates that there is a transfer of responsibility for roll control during a specific phase in the operation of the aircraft. It commonly points to the fact that roll control management is passed on from one party to another. 6. The control tower (engl. tower): A control tower is a central hub responsible for governing and managing various actions surrounding aircraft operations. This may include coordinating takeoffs and landings, relaying flight information to pilots, and providing guidance during emergency situations. The term \\"tower\\" refers to the physical structure of the control tower, usually an elevated building or platform that provides a clear view of airport activity. In summary, this text refers to the various aspects of managing and monitoring the movements, positioning, and roll control of aircraft and vehicles during the run-up phase of their operations. This includes visual and radar-based monitoring measures as well as the transfer of responsibility for roll control between parties, such as an airplane to the control tower."},{"question":"Final Boss was a professional esports team that competed in competitions for a military science first-person shooter video game franchise that was developed by 343 Industries, and was created by who?

The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees. At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square. After being whipped, he begs for water. Esmeralda pities him, and brings him some. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin both learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grants her sanctuary. Don Claudio restrains Quasimodo from violence. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force.

Available choices: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","response":"- yes. The statement claims that the threatened 25-century-old Egyptian temple was dismantled and relocated to Madrid. If a 25-century-old temple was successfully dismantled and reassembled, regardless of location, it could very well be seen as a modern marvel due to the undertaking and complexity of such a task. This kind of venture requires advanced engineering and careful work to ensure that no part of the temple is damaged during transport and reassembly. The answer \\"it is not possible to tell\\" is incorrect because the statement makes a clear and unambiguous claim that the temple was transferred and reassembled. The statement \\"no,\\" is also incorrect because it rejects the notion that such an ambitious and successful project could be considered a modern marvel."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a dialogue between a customer and a flight booking agent with a gap in the conversation.

After being happy for a bit, Raul decided to be a little more productive because the Options: + happy people felt fulfilled later on. + productive people felt fulfilled later on.","response":"Raul chose to believe that productive people felt fulfilled later on. He knew that his happiness would only feel more meaningful if he could achieve something significant alongside it. So, he started his journey towards finding his passion and being more productive in his daily life. During his early days of introspection, Raul realized he had always enjoyed being close to nature. As a kid, he would often wander off into nearby forests and spend his time observing the birds and animals. This passion for nature had always been inside him, lying dormant. Once he realized this, Raul knew it was time to reignite that flame and use it as a catalyst for productivity. By combining his love for nature with his newfound drive to be productive, Raul started exploring opportunities to work with environmental organizations. He volunteered at a local animal shelter and signed up for workshops to learn more about conservation and wildlife protection. With each passing day, Raul could feel his satisfaction growing as he made a tangible impact on the world around him. Within a few months, Raul had gained considerable knowledge and experience in the field of environmental conservation. He soon came across an opportunity to help with a reforestation project in a nearby town. This project aimed to restore a patch of land that had been devastated by illegal logging activities. Raul was thrilled to join the project. He loved the idea of helping bring back life to the damaged area, and he saw it as the perfect opportunity to put his skills to the test and be even more productive. Starting early in the mornings, Raul and the other volunteers would plant saplings and care for the young trees, ensuring they had everything they needed to grow strong and healthy. They also built fences around the reforested area to keep away grazing animals, and collaborated with the local community to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the environment. Raul discovered that the sense of accomplishment he felt when he saw the saplings grow and thrive was truly unparalleled. Moreover, the friendships he formed along the way with like-minded individuals provided him with a sense of belonging and camaraderie. With each passing day, Raul felt more fulfilled. After months of hard work, Raul and the other volunteers finally saw the fruits of their labor. The reforestation project had successfully transformed a barren area into a lush, green haven for wildlife. As Raul looked around at the beautiful, thriving environment he and his team had created, he couldn't help but feel immense pride and satisfaction. Through his dedication to being productive and working towards a cause that he was passionate about, Raul had found a sense of fulfillment that went beyond fleeting happiness. He knew that he had made a lasting impact on the world and also, on his own life. In pursuing productivity, Raul had not only found purpose - he had also found lasting happiness. Now, whenever Raul thought back on his decision to chase productivity, he knew he had made the right choice. He was living proof that productive people felt fulfilled later on, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held in store for him. With newfound determination and a deep sense of purpose, Raul continued to dedicate himself to making the world a better place, one tree at a time."},{"question":"An Iranian man should be sentenced to having his eyes gouged out after pouring acid over a young girl's face leaving her blind, an Iranian court has ruled. Opposition group, The National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the man could have his right ear and nose cut off as punishment for attacking the girl with acid, causing her to lose her eyesight and right ear. The man was convicted last October of intentionally attacking the girl, haartez.com reported. President Hassan Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. But an increased use of the death penalty has dashed hopes the country's will improve its human rights record, the UN said. The national council said Iran's high court defended cutting off the body parts of those found guilty of a crime, and removing eyes, as part of the country's judicial system. Last month, the state-run Mehr news. agency, reported another Iranian man was sentenced to have one hand and. one foot cut off as punishment for an unspecified crime. As many as 95 people are thought to have been executed in Iran this year. The dramatic rise in the use of the death penalty has dashed hopes for human rights reform under President Hassan Rohani, the United Nations said earlier this year. President Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. In September, the country released dozens of political prisoners, prompting hopes Iran would improve their human rights record. 'There were some encouraging signs last year where political prisoners were released ... But it appears at least in the past seven weeks that in fact executions have been scaled up,' UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing. 'We regret that the new government has not changed its approach to the death penalty and continues to impose capital punishment for a wide range of offences. We urge the government to immediately halt executions and to institute a moratorium.' Last year Iran executed between 500 and 625 people, including at least 28 women and two children, Ms Shamdasani said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"An Iranian court has ruled that a man who poured acid over a young girl's face, resulting in her blindness, should have his eyes gouged out as a form of punishment.

There were some hopeful signs last year, such as the release of political prisoners, but recent events have shown an increase in executions within the country. These types of punishments, in which body parts are removed or mutilated, can be seen as a violation of basic human rights and have received widespread international condemnation. It is essential that Iran reevaluate its judicial system and reconsider the use of these harsh and inhumane punishments, especially when it comes to non-violent crimes and those committed by minors. Implementing reforms that focus on rehabilitation and more proportional punishment methods could help improve Iran's human rights record and foster a more progressive and compassionate society."},{"question":"Given the following context: Tara is a wife to Mark and a stay-at-home mother to two children, Teddy and Florrie.

Because the restaurant is spacious, it made the emptiness seem that much worse. - There is a sign outside the restaurant that states \\"5 for walk-ins\\"... Ok, what the hell does that even mean? So, if I placed my order on the spot instead of calling in ahead, then does that mean that I would have gotten my meal for only 5? There needs to be some clarification on that!
