To combine them, add 6m to both sides of the equation: (-6m + 6m) - 12 = 6m + 6m This simplifies to: 0 - 12 = 12m Step 2: Simplify the equation further Now, you only need to solve for m. The equation in its simplified form is: -12 = 12m Step 3: Isolate the variable m To isolate m, divide both sides of the equation by 12: -12/12 = 12m/12 This results in: -1 = m So, the solution to the equation is m = -1."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: I am pleased to support the decision by the Agency's Board of Management to adopt standards of internal control based on the standards adopted by the Commission and on ISO 9000.

Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist.

Hypothesis: A man is pointing at the bird. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","response":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis. The premise states that a man wearing a helmet is pointing at the camera, while the hypothesis claims that a man is pointing at a bird. There are discrepancies and missing links between the two statements which prevent us from making a solid conclusion. Firstly, the premise focuses on the man's action of pointing at the camera. This implies that the man's attention is directed towards the person who is taking the photo or video, or potentially the device being used. There is no mention of a bird in the premise, leaving us no basis to establish anything about the bird's presence or involvement in this scenario. Secondly, the hypothesis refers to a man pointing at a bird, which is a different object from the camera as mentioned in the premise. While it is possible that a bird is present in the scene, we cannot confirm its presence or determine whether the man is pointing at the bird based on the given information. In order to conclude that the hypothesis is accurate, we would require additional evidence or information that would link the actions described in the premise to the bird mentioned in the hypothesis. For example, if we were provided with more details, such as: \\"A bird is seen in the camera's view and appears to be the reason for the man's pointing gesture,\\" then we would have a reason to believe the hypothesis to be true. However, without such information, we are unable to draw any conclusions or verify the hypothesis based on the provided premise alone. In summary, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man is pointing at the bird\\" is true based on the given premise \\"A man wearing a helmet points at the camera\\" due to the absence of any reference to a bird and the discrepancy in the subjects being pointed at. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, more information would be necessary in order to provide a clear connection between the man's actions and the presence of a bird in the scenario."},{"question":"The Chess Player's Chronicle, founded by Howard Staunton and extant from 1841–56 and 1859–62, was the world's first successful English-language magazine devoted exclusively to chess. Various unrelated but identically or similarly named publications were published until 1902. Can we draw the following conclusion? The chronicle was only chess","response":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that The Chess Player's Chronicle, founded by Howard Staunton, was a magazine devoted exclusively to chess. However, it is essential to examine this conclusion in more detail and provide a comprehensive understanding of the context, content, and legacy of the publication. The Chess Player's Chronicle was established in 1841 by the prominent English chess player, Howard Staunton. It was the world's first successful English-language magazine focused solely on chess. The chronicle's exclusive chess-related content included game analysis, tournament reports, and essays on various chess topics, making it a comprehensive source for chess enthusiasts and professionals alike. Throughout its publication period, which can be broadly divided into two phases (1841-1856 and 1859-1862), the Chronicle played a significant role in promoting and popularizing chess in the English-speaking world. Howard Staunton, through his meticulous work, contributed to the development of a more systematic playing style, endorsing internationally recognized chess moves and rules, such as the Staunton Gambit. Furthermore, The Chess Player's Chronicle provided a platform for the discussion of chess strategy, tactics, and history, fostering a sense of community among chess players worldwide. The magazine not only covered the games and achievements of prominent English players, but it also featured international masters and their games, promoting the exchange of ideas, styles, and knowledge. It is also worth mentioning that after the initial publication run of The Chess Player's Chronicle ended in 1862, several unrelated but similarly named chess publications emerged sporadically, up until 1902. These publications maintained the central theme of focusing solely on chess, perpetuating the legacy of the first Chess Player's Chronicle. In conclusion, we can ascertain that The Chess Player's Chronicle, founded by Howard Staunton, was indeed a magazine centered exclusively on chess, playing a crucial role in the development and popularization of the game. Through its content, it set a precedent for future chess publications and contributed immensely to the culture surrounding the game."},{"question":"Q:Information: - STATS is a sports statistics, technology, data, and content company founded in 1981.

D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition. - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). - The Connecticut State Universities (CSU) are part of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities, the largest public higher education system in Connecticut, and the second largest in New England.

Over time the other three institutions were founded as normal schools and in 1959 they were converted into state colleges to reflect their expanded mission. From their founding until 1965, they were overseen by the Connecticut State Department of Education. In 1965 the General Assembly transferred control of the then-colleges to an independent Board of Trustees. In 1983 the four institutions were converted into universities, together constituting the Connecticut State University System. - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).

Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - The College Football Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and museum devoted to college football.

She rests from bicycling 2 hours after her pace reaches her maximum speed of 14 kmph. She does a cool-down for the final 8 km at a pace of 2 kmph. How far in km did she bicycle? Options: (A) 96 km (B) 100 km (C) 106 km (D) 116 km (E) 126 km Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"We can break down the woman's bicycling journey into several phases. Phase 1: Bicycling at an initial pace of 10 kmph. Time: 2 hours Phase 2: Increasing the pace by 2 kmph (12 kmph) Time: 2 hours Phase 3: Increasing the pace again by 2 kmph (14 kmph) Time: 2 hours At this point, she reaches her maximum speed of 14 kmph, so she rests for 2 hours. This resting period does not contribute to the distance cycled. Phase 4: Cooling down at a pace of 2 kmph. Since the cool-down is for the final 8 km, we can find the time spent in this phase by using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 8 km / 2 kmph = 4 hours Now, we will calculate the distance she covered in each phase: Phase 1: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 10 kmph x 2 hours = 20 km Phase 2: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 12 kmph x 2 hours = 24 km Phase 3: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 14 kmph x 2 hours = 28 km Phase 4: Distance = 8 km (given in the problem) Total distance = Phase 1 distance + Phase 2 distance + Phase 3 distance + Phase 4 distance Total distance = 20 km + 24 km + 28 km + 8 km = 80 km Therefore, the woman bicycled 80 km in total. However, this distance is not included in the given options. Please re-check the problem statement or the given options to ensure their accuracy."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Non-standard Czech is called? Context: In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard, Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech. During the second half of the twentieth century, Czech dialect use began to weaken. By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech. Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects. Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.","response":"Common Czech"},{"question":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: yes","response":"Question: Can art have a positive impact on an individual's mental well-being?

When Johnny Quinlan loses his job in a drug store, he is afraid to tell his wife, Bertha, and therefore keeps up the pretense of leaving each morning for a non-existent job, as he begins the search for a new job. As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have. As he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \\"Nifty\\" Herman, a small-time gangster. Nifty had loaned Johnny 15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him. After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store. All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days. Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment. However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't. Taking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home. When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting. Newton is a government agent. Even though Johnny tries to hide the case, his efforts are futile, and Newton spies it and becomes suspicious, seeing a resemblance to a case he and his men have been attempting to track down. Opening it, he discovers it contains a cache of drugs. When he interrogates Johnny, he gets the whole story, and is about to arrest Johnny, when Nifty arrives to retrieve the suitcase. Johnny tricks Nifty into confessing, and then subdues him, when he is resisting the efforts of Newton and his deputies to arrest him. The film ends with Johnny being rewarded for the way he handled himself by becoming Newton's assistant.

Options are: + Use a spoon to carefully scoop it out + Use a toothpick to carefully scoop it out...I think the answer is","response":"In order to determine the most reasonable method, let us evaluate both options step by step: 1. Using a spoon: + A spoon has a larger surface area than a toothpick, which will provide better support for the dough ball. + The curved shape of the spoon will encapsulate the dough ball more securely as you scoop it out. + The spoon handle, especially if it has a long handle, keeps your hand at a safe distance from the boiling oil. + A spoon made of heat-resistant materials like metal will not be damaged by the high temperatures of the oil. + The spoon can also be used to drain some of the excess oil from the dough ball as you lift it out. Given these considerations, using a spoon is a logical choice for this task. 2. Using a toothpick: - A toothpick has a minuscule surface area, which does not provide stable support for the dough ball. - The straight, pointy shape of a toothpick makes it difficult to secure the dough ball without damaging its integrity. - The toothpick's short length brings your hand closer to the boiling oil, increasing the risk of accidental burns. - A toothpick, typically made of wood or plastic, may not withstand the high temperatures of the oil and could break or melt. - The toothpick provides no means of draining excess oil as the dough ball is removed. Given these considerations, using a toothpick is not a reasonable choice for this task.

Movie title: No Holds Barred Movie plot: The 1989 feature film No Holds Barred stars no other than the immortal Hulk Hogan as a professional wrestler, who is in fight of his life against an evil network executive. Let me begin with this disclaimer; if you are not a wrestling fan do not bother to tune in.The movie is actually produced by the WWF and Vince McMahon under the the Shane Distribution Company. There are cameos from Jesse Ventura and Mean Gene Okerland as commentators and Howard Finkel as the ring announcer. You also get to see the legendary Stan Hansen who plays rugged tough guy at the bar visited by the television executives.Now if you are a wrestling fan than you definitely need to see this movie. Hulk Hogan plays a character who is close to his real life self at the time. His name is Rip and he is the biggest attraction on television as the WWF Champion. Rip is motivated by his younger brother Randy who is ringside at all of his big matches. He attracts the interest of a rival network executive Brell (Kurt Fuller) who wants to boost his networks ratings.Rip does not take accept Brells offer to join his network and chooses to stay faithful. Brell decides to start his own show called Battle of The Tough Guys which becomes extremely popular with the introduction of a man called Zeus. Zeus is an ex-convict who actually killed an opponent in a ring once. Even with this success Brell still wants to get his hands on Rip and have him on his network. Rip also meets a love interest, who may not be all that she seems. Through a series of twist and turns Rip will be forced to take on Brells monster Zeus in the fight of his life. Answer:","response":"The show that Brell, the rival network executive played by Kurt Fuller, started in the movie is called \\"Battle of The Tough Guys.\\" The premise of this show was to feature fights between tough and rugged men in order to boost the network's ratings.

Despite the success of \\"Battle of The Tough Guys,\\" Brell remains determined to bring Rip, the WWF Champion played by Hulk Hogan, to his network.

Nevertheless, a more suitable ending could be: \\"After playing football together for an enjoyable amount of time, they all decided to call it a day and head home.\\" This conclusion is more plausible than the second option, \\"Sam and John ran from the group of boys,\\" as there was no indication of a problem or a conflict that might have prompted them to run away. The story mentioned that Sam and John requested to play with the others, and they agreed, suggesting that camaraderie and a friendly environment had been established.

Erin's more cautious nature seemed to balance out the duo, with her level-headedness providing guidance and reassurance. Recently, Laura had been going through some personal challenges that had caused her to act even more erratically than usual. She seemed to be searching for an escape, any indication she could find that could make her feel more in control of her life. Erin couldn't help but feel partially responsible for her friend's state of mind and was worried that, left unsupervised, Laura might make choices that could lead to irreparable consequences. As Erin monitored Laura's movements, she also made it a point to be involved in her life and to keep the lines of communication open. They would frequently grab a coffee together, go for a walk in the park, or enjoy a night in watching a movie. They discussed their thoughts and feelings with an openness and honesty that many found rare in friendships. It was crucial that Laura knew that, no matter the circumstance, Erin was there to support her. There were moments when Erin's concerns ran high, but she quickly discovered that her vigilance and consistent presence in her friend's life seemed to be making a positive impact. Slowly, Laura was beginning to regain her footing and make healthier choices. She appeared to be genuinely happy more frequently, which was a relieving sign for Erin. In seeing these changes, Erin began to understand the importance of the role that a strong support network should play in someone's life. It wasn't just about her being there for Laura; it was about building a group of people who genuinely cared for one another and lifted each other up in times of need. So, as Erin continued to watch over Laura, she knew the value of cultivating such a safety net between friends and family members. The bond between Erin and Laura only grew stronger over time, as other friends joined their circle, and each person contributed to the close-knit community they created together. And as they moved through life together, the knowledge that they all had each other's backs made facing the challenges life had to offer a little less daunting. In the end, Erin's vigilance and willingness to be there for Laura helped steer her friend on a healthier path. It was a clear reminder of the power that true friendship holds and the impact that a close-knit and supportive community can have on individuals' lives. Erin knew that keeping a watchful eye on her friends, working together to maintain a safe and supportive environment, could make all the difference in the world."},{"question":"Skylar helped Jan not be sad on the way home from school.

Article: The average British 22 year-old has more than 1,000 online friends on sites like Facebook, compared to those in their fifties who have fewer than 20, according to a new study. The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: \\"Our research underlines fundamental changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old.\\" He added: \\"Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not.\\" Question: Which is the determining factor in social networking activity? Answer: Available options: (i) Gender; (ii) Age; (iii) Relationship; (iv) Pace; The answer is:","response":"(ii) Age; Based on the research conducted by Intersperience, the determining factor in social networking activity is age.

Younger individuals, such as 22-year-olds, claim to have 1,000 or more friends on social network sites like Facebook, while people in their fifties have fewer than 20. This gap exists despite the popularity of Facebook with older generations. The research further breaks down the number of online friends people have according to age group: - Aged 13 to 16: an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends than boys. - In their thirties: between 100 and 200 friends. - In their forties: between 50 and 100 friends. - Over the age of 50: 20 or fewer friends. Intersperience's chief executive, Paul Hudson, explains that the different number of online friends among various age groups reflects the different paces at which these groups are adapting to the digital age.

The store initially sold out all items but then ordered 4458 items to restock. So after restocking, they have 4458 items in the store. Step 2: Determine the total number of items after selling some of the restocked items. Customer came to buy that day and then Barney's grocery store sold 1561 items. After selling these items, we need to subtract that number from the restocked total to find out what remains in the store (unsold items): Total items after restocking = 4458 Items sold after restocking = 1561 Items remaining in the store (unsold) = 4458 - 1561 = 2897 items Step 3: Now let's account for the leftover items in the storeroom. We know there are 575 items in the storeroom, and we have to add them to the number of items in the store (unsold) that we found in step 2: Items remaining in the store (unsold) = 2897 Items in the storeroom = 575 Total items left in the whole store = 2897 + 575 = 3472 items Final answer: Barney's grocery store has 3472 items left in the whole store (including the storeroom)."},{"question":"according to the national gardening association, an estimated 43 million households gardened in 2009.

A. apartment B. house C. table D. house E. school The best answer is A:","response":"The best answer to the question,\\"Where would you use a computer while gaining knowledge?\\" is: E. School. While it's true that you can use a computer almost anywhere to gain knowledge, including an apartment (A) or a house (B and D), the most appropriate and educationally-enriched setting among the options provided is certainly a school (E). Schools are designed specifically for the purpose of learning and gaining knowledge. They provide a structured environment where students, teachers, and academic resources come together for the collective goal of education. In such an environment, using a computer as a tool for learning is highly encouraged and supported. At a school, computers are typically equipped with a wide range of educational software, digital textbooks, and e-learning resources that are vetted and curated by educators. This ensures that the content available on school computers is not only relevant and age-appropriate but also academically accurate and engaging. Additionally, schools often have designated computer labs and libraries where students can access computers and receive guidance from teachers or support staff when needed. These resources may not be available at home or in an apartment, where learners must rely on their own devices and internet connections for research and assignments. Moreover, schools facilitate collaboration and group projects where students can share their knowledge and learn from one another. In such cases, computers become invaluable tools for group research, communication, and documentation. The structured setting and support systems of a school environment ensure that a computer's potential for fostering learning is maximized. In summary, even though using a computer in the comfort of one's own home or apartment has its benefits, a school environment provides the resources, guidance, collaboration opportunities, and educational content necessary to enhance the learning experience while using a computer. Therefore, E. School is the best answer to the question."},{"question":"Generate a descriptive sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Alimentum, food = Chinese, priceRange = moderate, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes","response":"Alimentum is a nice restaurant by the riverside where families can enjoy yummy Chinese food that doesn't cost too much money."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Make this proper case.","response":"Being much younger at that time, we tried setting Roman candles up near the ice rink edge to try to make them come back up, but to no avail. In our youthful curiosity and excitement, we had stumbled upon the idea of combining the dynamic nature of Roman candles with the slippery surface of an ice rink. With our hearts set on entertaining ourselves and basking in the dazzling display that we anticipated, we eagerly approached the edge of the ice rink. Our creative minds believed that if we placed the Roman candles strategically, we could start a chain reaction or even a continuous cycle of fireworks lightening up the sky. However, despite our enthusiasm, our plan didn't quite pan out as we had hoped. We began by carefully positioning the Roman candles at specific points along the periphery of the ice rink. We ensured they were sturdy and secure, with their fiery tails aimed towards the icy surface. As we stepped back, our eyes widened in anticipation, hoping to witness our clever creation come to life. We lit the candles, and the first few rockets shot out, piercing the cold air with a splendid streak of light. Our hearts soared with excitement, and we could hardly contain our grins as the beautiful display unfolded before our eyes. However, our joy was short-lived, as we soon realized that the ice wasn't assisting in the realization of our grand vision. Our main goal was to see the Roman candles bounce back up after hitting the ice, creating a mesmerizing and continuous firework show. However, as each firework made its descent onto the ice, they simply slid across the slippery surface, extinguishing themselves in the process. No matter how we readjusted or repositioned the Roman candles, the ice refused to cooperate, and our dream of a cyclic display of pyrotechnics remained unattained. Despite the lack of success in our experiment, we couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment for even attempting such a unique endeavor. Our youthful hearts were bursting with pride and excitement, and we took the memory of that icy adventure with us into our later years. In the end, the experience taught us a valuable lesson: while not all of our ideas may pan out exactly as we hoped, the joy and wonder of attempting something new far outweigh any disappointment we may face. And so, with that lesson engrained in our minds, we continued to explore, experiment, and dream, leaving no stone unturned in our quest for creativity and adventure."},{"question":"Dies macht Korea zu einem unserer wichtigsten Exportmärkte in Asien.

We started with the Bruschetta and Caprese Salad, and both appetizers were full of flavor and looked picture-perfect.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"?

It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Since 1952, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern. The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail. The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown. The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Do people ride on horses?","response":"Yes, people do ride on horses during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo's traditional trail rides.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape and while the girls play cards, Cheryl then becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them.

I knew Ronaldo would rule the world. Roy Keane has hit out at Manchester United's famous 'class of '92' by saying their importance to the club's dominance of English football has been overstated. United's legendary youth side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 contained the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Phil Neville; all became vital to later success at Old Trafford. The group of players took their story to the silver screen, releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom. But Keane, in his new autobiographyThe Second Half, airs his distaste for the 'brand' of the group. He also uncovered a different side to Scholes, who has always been revered for his squeaky-clean image off the field. 'Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image,' Keane said. 'Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.'

With almost 4,000 senior matches for United and close to 100 major trophies between them, Beckham and Co clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of Red Devils players since the Busby Babes in the 1950s, but Keane believes the Class of '92 'brand' has slightly overtaken the team's own success in that period. Keane adds: 'The Class of ’92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated. 'The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it. However, the Corkman clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful United youth graduates to date, 'But we all had the same aims. We all had the same hunger.' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.' Former United youth team coach Eric Harrison (front) with his young stars in 1993 which included Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes. The famous group of players released the Class of 92' documentary film in November, 2013. Regrets apologising to Ferguson. Does not regret his tackle on Haaland. Told Fergie 'We need f****** more' Wouldn't have missed a drugs test like Rio. Headbutted Peter Schmeichel. Profited from Glazer takeover. 'Glad' Clive Clarke suffered a heart attack. Keane crosses line to dangerous territory. On that MUTV interview. Knew Ronaldo would be one of the best. Class of 92. Real Madrid regret. Ferguson wanted me to wear No 7. Turned down Celtic this summer. Re-opens feud with Fergie. Keane and the Class of '92 became the most successful side in the club's rich history as Ferguson's side completed the Treble in 1999, becoming the first English club to achieve such a feat. The Red Devils went undefeated for 33 games in all competitions before producing the most dramatic of Champions League comebacks against Bayern Munich - a final which Keane was forced to miss through suspension. Speaking about the talented generation, Ferguson said: 'I have been fortunate to work with many exceptional young players, but the Class of 92 was unique. For so many of them to stay together and succeed at the highest level is a great tribute to their talent and this club’s belief in the power of youth. 'I am convinced that no group of players will ever make such an impact on the English game as those boys have done – and continue to do.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page. Keane celebrates with David Beckham (right) - the most famous youth product to come out of the Class of '92. Keane claims the Class of '92 has 'grown its own legs' as a brand and 'their role at the club was exaggerated' despite being good players.

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: \\"This is great isn’t it?\\". I went: \\"I used to play in these games Adrian\\". I wasn’t being cocky. 'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: \\"Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you\\". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: \\"I liked your commentary last night\\". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby.

Which township is experiencing fewer tornadoes? Answer:","response":"Jolt Township is likely experiencing fewer tornadoes than Burr Township. This is because the conditions present in Jolt Township—higher altitude, less windy, and less cloudy—are less conducive to the formation of tornadoes. Tornadoes typically form in areas with significant atmospheric instability and strong wind shears. Atmospheric convection, which is occurring in Burr Township, contributes to this instability by creating the upward motion of warm, moist air. As the air rises, it cools and forms thunderstorm clouds, which can potentially lead to the development of tornadoes. Additionally, the lower altitude of Burr Township allows for more significant moisture availability and the potential for more frequent thunderstorms, another key factor in tornado formation. On the other hand, the higher elevation in Jolt Township results in less available moisture, which can limit the potential for thunderstorm formation and tornadoes. Finally, the less windy and less cloudy conditions in Jolt Township suggest a stable atmosphere, which further reduces the likelihood of tornadoes. In short, Jolt Township's overall atmospheric conditions make it less likely for tornadoes to form compared to Burr Township."},{"question":"Great happy hour!

Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock. - The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century. It was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon. - In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980. - ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition. - Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product. - Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length . It 's also a very unusual song for the band , as Jimmy Page 's guitar work is pushed almost to the background , while John Paul Jones dominates with heavy use of synthesizers . - Polar Studios was a recording studio in Stockholm, Sweden, which operated from 1978 through 2004. The studio was formed by ABBA musicians Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and the band's manager Stig Anderson, owner of the Polar Music recording label. - A carousel (American English: from French \\"carrousel\\" and Italian \\"carosello\\"), roundabout (British English), or merry-go-round, is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \\"seats\\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper. Other popular names are jumper, horseabout and flying horses. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Robert Anthony Plant, (born 20 August 1948) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin. A powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-pitched vocals) has given him a successful solo career spanning over 30 years. Plant is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock and roll; he has influenced fellow rock singers such as Freddie Mercury, Axl Rose and Chris Cornell. In 2006, Heavy Metal magazine \\"Hit Parader\\" named Plant the \\"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\\". In 2009, Plant was voted \\"the greatest voice in rock\\" in a poll conducted by \\"Planet Rock\\". In 2008, \\"Rolling Stone\\" editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, \\"Rolling Stone\\" readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers. - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Circus music (also known as carnival music) is any sort of music that is played to accompany a circus, and also music written that emulates its general style. Popular music would also often get arranged for the circus band, as well as waltzes, foxtrots and other dances. - James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin. - A Zeppelin was a type of rigid airship named after the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century. Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \\"zeppelin\\" came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During World War I the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people in bombing raids in Britain.

Which language is this?","response":"The given text \\"Arabialaisten isäntämaiden on tunnettava vastuunsa ja lakattava käyttämästä Palestiinan kysymystä väärin omiin poliittisiin tarkoituksiinsa.\\" is in Finnish. Finnish belongs to the Finno-Ugric family of languages, and it's spoken by approximately five million people, most of whom reside in Finland. The language is known for its complex grammar system. The Finnish language has 15 nominal cases and verbs are conjugated differently based on the personal pronouns. The verb in Finnish language doesn't depend on person or number meaning it will stay the same with all persons. That being said, there is no grammatical gender in Finnish, nor are there articles (like a, an, the in English). Finnish has borrowed words from various languages over the course of history, including Swedish, Russian, Baltic languages, German, and more recently, English. Still, the majority of Finnish vocabulary is purely Finno-Ugric in origin. The Finnish language is known for its beauty and complexity. It is often used as an example of a \\"complex\\" language due to its rich inflection. For instance, the Finnish language often uses compound words, and one word in Finnish can correspond to a phrase in a different language. For instance in your sample sentence, \\"Arabialaisten isäntämaiden\\", would roughly translate to \\"Arab host countries\\" in English. And the full sentence \\"Arabialaisten isäntämaiden on tunnettava vastuunsa ja lakattava käyttämästä Palestiinan kysymystä väärin omiin poliittisiin tarkoituksiinsa.\\" roughly translates to \\"Arab host countries must recognize their responsibility and stop misusing the Palestinian issue for their own political purposes.\\" Finally, having official status in both Finland and Sweden, Finnish is not only used domestically but also in various international organizations, including the Nordic Council and the European Union."},{"question":"Words are great, but pictures say much more. Include as many pictures, graphs, tables, charts, diagrams, etc., as possible. Keep your backgrounds (i.e., whatever is behind your graphics and text) simple and subtle. Reading the text that is on top of a colourful or complex background can be difficult and distracting. Try to print as many of your graphics in colour as possible, especially graphs and charts where the colour distinguishes between different items or variables. If you don't have access to a colour printer, you can use markers or crayons to add color to things like graphs and charts. Each visual item (graph, chart, table, diagram, picture, etc.) should have its own number (or letter), plus a descriptive caption. When the main text refers to a specific visual item, that number or letter should be used. The caption should accurately and quickly describe what is contained in the visual item, and can be printed in slightly smaller font (less than 16 pt). Your main text and captions should include the technical or scientific names, terms and jargon for the discipline your project is based on. If necessary, you can also include a glossary of terms on your display board or in your project report. Using the proper terms is especially important if your project is being displayed in a science fair or event that is being judged by professionals. If your project is really complex, you can also include a 'layman's summary' as part of your display which sums up your project in language anyone can understand. This is particularly useful if your display board is also being viewed by fellow students, parents, or non-professionals. It can be tempting to get really creative and eccentric when creating a project display board, but try to avoid the temptation! A good project display board is one that is uncluttered, has easy-to-read and clear material, contains graphics that effectively explain your project, and colours that don't overwhelm the viewer. Search the web for example display boards to get an idea of what works well, and what doesn't. Ask your teacher for advice on what to do and not to do, and for examples of project boards that previously received awesome grades. Display boards come in a standard size of 36” tall and 48” wide. You can buy or make larger (or smaller) boards, but make sure the size is not only appropriate for your display but also allowed by the event (if such rules exist). These display boards have three panels - the middle panel which is half the width of the whole board, and the two outside panels that are a quarter of the width each. The two outside panels can fold over the middle panel to close the board for transport. And the outside panels can be used to stand the whole display board upright on a table. You can find display boards at online retailers like Amazon.com or at your local school supply store. Bigger is not always better. Boards that are really tall or really wide may be difficult to read and/or contain too much information.

Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD.

As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley. - Theodore von Kármán (; 11 May 1881 6 May 1963) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist who was active primarily in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics. He is responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. He is regarded as the outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the twentieth century. - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888. - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students. Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College. - Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words \\"r\\", which means \\"air\\", and \\"nautik\\" which means \\"navigation\\", i.e. \\"navigation into the air\\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \\"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\\" and \\"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\\" - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. - Hans Wolfgang Liepmann ( July 3 , 1914 -- June 24 , 2009 ) was an American engineer and emeritus Theodore von Kármán Professor of Aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology .

He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. - Aerodynamics, from Greek \\"aer\\" (air) + (dynamics), is a branch of fluid dynamics concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. Aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term \\"aerodynamics\\" is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that \\"gas dynamics\\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, not limited to air. Formal aerodynamics study in the modern sense began in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag have been recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed the scientific basis for ongoing developments in heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow, turbulence, and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.

The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years. The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

My mom suggested that I organize a food drive in our development and donate what I collected to a local shelter.Anything that would help finish the project seemed like a good idea, so I agreed.I made up flyers asking for donations and placed flyers at every house in my neighborhood. I was getting ready to fetch the cans from my neighbor's yards on the day of the food drive when all of a sudden it started to pour.Rain flooded the roads and wind blew hard, but I was determined to complete my task.My mom drove me around our development and I jumped out at every house to collect items people had put out. When we finally arrived the shelter, I was a little nervous because I had never been there before.The woman in charge was extremely grateful for the donations and said that the world would be ganizing the food drive and delighted that my service to the community would make a difference in people's lives. As I was leaving the shelter, a man asked if I was the one who had brought all the food.I shyly nodded, and he said, \\"A round here, you are a hero.\\" From that point on, I made myself a promise that I would serve the community more often, even when it was not required.Through this school assignment, I have realized that caring for others is an important part of living and the world would be a completely different place if people all help those who are less fortunate.

Consider the context: Bailey is looking for a place to leave his vehicle, which implies he is searching for a parking spot. The fact that he can't find a parking lot anywhere suggests that the area he is in might be limited in size or infrastructure. 2. Analyze the options provided: - Business district: A small business district might have difficulty providing enough parking spots due to limited space for vehicles. However, it does not necessarily imply the reason Bailey couldn't find a parking lot. - City: A small city generally has enough parking infrastructure or at least designated areas for parking. This option is less likely to be the reason for Bailey's difficulty finding a parking spot. - Town: A small town implies that the infrastructure is quite limited, which could include an insufficient number of parking lots. This option is more likely to be the reason why Bailey couldn't find a parking lot. - Car: This option is irrelevant to Bailey's difficulty in finding a parking spot. - Vehicle: This option has nothing to do with the issue Bailey faces. 3.

This is Steve Jobs’ post-PC era writ large. “I’m trying to think of a good analogy,” Jobs said as he explained the concept to All Things D‘s audience last year. “When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks. But as people moved more towards urban centers, people started to get into cars. I think PCs are going to be like trucks. Less people will need them. And this transformation is going to make some people uneasy… because the PC has taken us a long way. They were amazing. But it changes. Vested interests are going to change. And, I think we’ve embarked on that change. Is it the iPad? Who knows? Will it be next year or five years? … We like to talk about the post-PC era, but when it really starts to happen, it’s uncomfortable.” “Uncomfortable” hardly begins to describe what HP is feeling right now. The company that swallowed Compaq and overtook Dell DELL to become the world’s largest PC vendor saw its margins shrink and its market share contract and decided it didn’t want to be in truck-making business anymore. And, sadly, when it tried to buy its way into the post-PC era by acquiring Palm, it couldn’t make that work either. The Pre’s slice of the smartphone market is too microscopic to show up in the pie charts, and the TouchPad has had the stink of death about it from the start. Two months after the tablet’s ballyhooed debut, thousands of unsold boxes are piling up in Best Buy’s warehouses. “Consumers are changing the use of their PC,” HP CEO Leo Apotheker told analysts Thursday. “The tablet effect is real and sales of the TouchPad are not meeting our expectations… The velocity of change in the personal device marketplace continues to increase as the competitive landscape is growing increasingly more complex especially around the personal computing arena. There’s a clear secular movement in the consumer PC space. The impact of the economy has impacted consumer sales and the tablet effect is real.” It could be, as TechCrunch‘s MG Siegler suggests, that buying Palm was the bright idea of disgraced former CEO Mark Hurd, and that the TouchPad’s bellyflop was the excuse Apotheker, who came from German enterprise software giant SAP SAP , had been looking for to get out of the consumer device business and remake the company in SAP’s — or IBM’s IBM or Oracle’s ORCL — image. But Apotheker was just the hatchet man. In the end, it was Apple that killed the TouchPad and left HP’s personal computer division circling the drain.","response":"In August 2011, Hewlett-Packard (HP) announced that it would discontinue its tablets and smartphones and potentially exit the personal computer market altogether. This decision was influenced by the increasing popularity of Apple's iPad and the shift towards a post-PC era, as predicted by Steve Jobs. HP's TouchPad failed to meet sales expectations, and the company realized that consumers were changing their PC usage habits. The tablet effect was real, with HP's market share and margins shrinking, leading the company to decide not to continue in the personal computing arena. Although factors such as the acquisition of Palm and the possible influence of former CEO Mark Hurd contributed to HP's troubles, it was primarily the rise of Apple's products that led to the discontinuation of the TouchPad and the potential exit of HP from the personal computer market."},{"question":"Sentence 1: Arrested Lawrence? I gasped. Sentence 2: I was shocked to hear that Lawrence had been arrested. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Both sentences convey the same core idea: Lawrence has been arrested, and the speaker is reacting with surprise. In both sentences, the implication is that the speaker has received this information and finds it unexpected or shocking. Entailment in this context means that the truth of the first sentence logically implies or necessitates the truth of the second sentence. In the first sentence, \\"Arrested Lawrence? I gasped,\\" the speaker expresses their shock through the words \\"I gasped\\". The use of \\"gasped\\" indicates that the revelation of Lawrence's arrest comes as a surprise, eliciting an audible and involuntary reaction from the speaker. The question-like statement \\"Arrested Lawrence?\\" emphasizes the sense of disbelief, as if the speaker is seeking confirmation or clarification, even though they already understand that Lawrence has been arrested. In the second sentence, \\"I was shocked to hear that Lawrence had been arrested,\\" the speaker explicitly states their emotional reaction to the news as being \\"shocked\\". Similar to the first sentence, this implies that the speaker was taken aback and found the information about Lawrence's arrest to be unexpected. Although the two sentences use different structures and wording, they both express the same fundamental idea – the speaker's surprise at learning about Lawrence's arrest. Since the truth of the first sentence logically leads to the truth of the second sentence, we can conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"question":"Given the question: Context: Remy was terrified of flying, but Taylor allayed Remy's fear by telling them how safe it was.

(CNN) -- A superpower needs a super attention span. Unfortunately, Americans seem to take little interest in the troubles of the world around them, even when those troubles threaten soon to vex Americans themselves. Americans fought two world wars -- and faced nuclear annihilation in a protracted Cold War -- to defend the freedom of Europe. In the thrilling days of 1989-91, four generations of American sacrifice were magnificently vindicated. The communist regimes of central Europe collapsed. The Soviet Union itself broke apart into smaller and less threatening pieces. For four centuries, the rulers of Russia had sought security for themselves by dominating first their own people, then their neighbors, then their neighbors' neighbors, then their neighbors' neighbors' neighbors ... until their power extended from Berlin to the Pacific Ocean.

Yet, it appears that the Kremlin has decided to test the limits of its influence once more. Recent actions in Crimea and ongoing tensions in Eastern Ukraine showcase a resurgence of Russian aggression, which poses a significant challenge to the stability of Europe and global peace. Americans, however, seem indifferent to this growing threat. With a rapidly changing world and numerous distractions at home, many have turned a blind eye to international conflicts. This lack of awareness is highly concerning, as history shows that disinterest can lead to devastating consequences. All it takes is one moment of complacency for a crisis to spiral out of control, and history has proven time and time again that unchecked aggression breeds more aggression. It is crucial that Americans shift their focus back to the global stage, recommit to the values and principles that have guided their nation for centuries, and engage in multifaceted and collaborative efforts with their allies. By doing this, the United States can not only safeguard its own interests but also uphold its responsibility as a superpower to maintain peace and stability around the world. Failure to confront the challenge of aggressive powers, whether it is Russia, China, or any other emerging global player, leaves America's allies in a precarious position. Can America still be counted on to protect the democratic values it once championed so vigorously? The answer lies within the American consciousness. Will they rediscover their collective will to actively participate in international affairs, or will they continue to let the world move forward without them? In a time when isolationism is no longer a viable option, the choice is clear: Americans must step up to the challenge and reaffirm their place as leaders in the global community.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who showed artistic promise from an early age?, what is it ?

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

OPT: [i] yes. [ii] it is not possible to tell. [iii] no.","response":"It is not possible to tell whether \\"A corgi jumping up to catch a ball indoors\\" can be concluded from the statement \\"A corgi jumps off a bale of hay, with water and buildings behind it.\\" These two statements describe different situations, and neither statement provides enough information to establish a definitive connection between the two scenarios. The first statement describes a scene where a corgi is jumping off a bale of hay, with water and buildings as a backdrop to the situation. This suggests that the scene is taking place outdoors, possibly in a rural or semi-urban setting. The presence of hay bales indicates that there may be a farm or agricultural area nearby. Furthermore, the fact that the corgi is jumping off the hay bale could imply that it is engaged in some form of play or physical activity. On the other hand, the second statement presents a situation where a corgi is indoors, jumping up to catch a ball. This is a completely different scenario, as it takes place inside a building and involves different actions performed by the corgi. The presence of a ball suggests that the corgi might be engaged in a play session or practicing its agility skills. There are several reasons why it is not possible to draw a conclusion between these two statements. Firstly, the settings for these events are different - one takes place outdoors, and the other indoors. Secondly, the actions performed by the corgi are different in each scenario. The corgi is jumping off a hay bale in the first statement, whereas it is jumping up to catch a ball in the second statement. Finally, these statements do not provide any information about a temporal connection between the events, meaning that we cannot determine whether they take place simultaneously, sequentially, or at entirely separate times. Thus, based on the information provided, the most appropriate response would be option [ii] - it is not possible to tell if \\"A corgi jumps off a bale of hay, with water and buildings behind it.\\" entails that \\"A corgi jumping up to catch a ball indoors.\\" Both scenarios are separate and distinct occurrences involving the corgi's actions in different contexts.

Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers had different pests attacking their plants. John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them. Mike had a slug problem, but had almost no aphides. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which farmer didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates? The answer to this question is:","response":"Mike is the farmer who didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates. This is because Mike was dealing with a slug problem and not an aphid problem like John was.

Such tasks typically involve evaluating and manipulating objects, using knowledge of forces, energy, stability, balance, and other factors. A detailed example of such a task is as follows: Task: Design and build a cantilever bridge using limited materials Objective: The goal is to construct a cantilever bridge that spans a specific distance while supporting a certain amount of weight without collapsing. Materials provided: - Craft sticks or popsicle sticks - Adhesive (glue, tape, or similar) - String or wire - Weights to test the bridge's strength (such as coins, washers, or marbles) Constraints: 1. The bridge cannot have any support in the middle of the span. 2. Participants can only use the provided materials. 3. The bridge should be able to support the specified weight for a minimum duration (e.g., 30 seconds). Steps to complete the task: 1. Research cantilever bridge design principles: Participants should first learn about the basic principles of cantilever bridge design, such as the distribution of forces, balance, mechanical advantage, and how these principles apply to various materials. 2. Create a blueprint: After understanding the fundamental principles, participants must design a blueprint for their bridge. They should plan the layout, including dimensions, joints, supports, and anchorage points. The design should be optimized to manage the stress and load effectively, using a combination of compression and tension elements. 3. Assemble the bridge: Using the blueprint as a guide, participants must assemble the bridge with the given materials. They should pay attention to crucial aspects such as achieving a strong and stable base, maintaining balance, and maximizing structural integrity. 4. Test the bridge: After completing the construction, participants must place the bridge between two platforms, with the specified span distance between them. Gradually add weights to the bridge (evenly distributed) until it reaches the required load it must support. Observe whether the bridge can handle the stress and how it adapts to changes in load distribution. 5. Analyze and iterate: If the bridge collapses during testing, participants should analyze the failure points and determine how to improve their design. This process may involve applying additional knowledge of physical principles, reinforcing weak areas, or redistributing the forces acting on the structure. Participants should iterate their design and test again until they achieve a successful outcome. Throughout this task, participants will be extensively using their physical reasoning abilities to understand the principles of bridge design and construction, balance forces, and manipulate materials to achieve the desired result. It tests their ability to apply physical concepts in real-world scenarios and adapt their designs based on experimentation and analysis. This task effectively demonstrates the practical applicability of physical reasoning skills."},{"question":"Answer the question...when did the last survivor of the american civil war die??","response":"The last survivor of the American Civil War, which was a big fight between people in the United States, passed away a very long time ago.

Eventually Frank approaches Archie in a cafe after getting over his loss and they both decide to travel to Perth to enlist. Before leaving, Archie gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he had decided to enlist. As Archie and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train, then walk across the desert and stop for the night at a cattle station. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank's father, an Irish immigrant. Due to Frank's Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the British Empire. However, Archie persuades him to try to enlist in the Light Horse. Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway: Bill (Robert Grubb), Barney (Tim McKenzie), and Snowy (David Argue).

The context is that the user feels that Kingston, another city in Jamaica, is usually given more attention as the \\"it spot\\", suggesting that there is a bias towards Kingston. Step 2: Determine the user's opinion or feeling In this tweet, the user wants to emphasize that Mandeville deserves attention too and that more locations on the island should be considered for weather forecasts.

Step 3: Assess the sentiment based on word choice and tone The user uses phrases like \\"not the only it spot\\" to make a point that Kingston should not be the only focus. The choice of words shows that the user is trying to assert the importance of Mandeville and other locations, in comparison to Kingston.

The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... The answer is:","response":"James Brown and Eastwood were the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre."},{"question":"Context: Addison drank a glass of water inside of the kitchen.

Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called New Zealand, there was a very exciting cricket game happening. It was a part of a big tournament called the World Cup. Cricket is a fun sport where people use a bat and a ball to score points called runs. This game was special because it was between two teams: Ireland and West Indies. The West Indies team was filled with strong players who had won many matches before. People thought they were going to win this game too. But, the Ireland team was brave and believed in themselves. They knew that they could surprise everyone and win if they did their best. On a lovely Sunday, the two teams got ready to play their first game in Pool B. Pool B is like a group of teams that have to play against each other before they can move to the next level in the World Cup. The game began, and both teams tried their hardest to score runs. The people watching were amazed when they saw how well the Ireland team played. The Ireland players hit the ball with the bat and ran as fast as they could to score points. They were doing such a good job that they were able to win the game by scoring four more wickets than West Indies. A wicket is a special point in cricket that is scored when a player gets the other team \\"out.\\" Ireland's win was a big surprise for everyone because no one expected them to beat the strong West Indies team. The Ireland players were very happy, and the people watching felt excited for them. This game was called the \\"first shock\\" of the World Cup because it was so unexpected and showed that even the underdog team can win if they work hard and believe in themselves! The end."},{"question":"Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Christopher Columbus circumnavigated the globe before anyone else.\\" Options: - yes - no Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","response":"No, the statement is factually incorrect. Let's consider the following reasoning process: 1. Christopher Columbus was known for his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean to the \\"New World,\\" primarily seeking a route to Asia for trade and exploration purposes. 2. Columbus completed four significant voyages between 1492 and 1502, but he never actually circumnavigated the globe. His travels were primarily focused in the Caribbean and some parts of Central and South America. 3. Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, is credited with the first successful circumnavigation of the Earth. His expedition set sail in 1519 and concluded in 1522, with only one of the original five ships, Victoria, returning to Spain after the journey. It should be noted that Magellan himself did not complete the full voyage, as he was killed in the Philippines in 1521. However, the surviving members of his crew, under the command of Juan Sebastian Elcano, continued the journey and successfully finished the circumnavigation. In conclusion, Christopher Columbus did not circumnavigate the globe before anyone else, and the statement is factually incorrect. Instead, it was the expedition initially led by Ferdinand Magellan that achieved this feat."},{"question":"How is \\"One example of this is pre-accession aid, which, as we all know, is awarded to potential candidate countries, but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established.\\" said in Romanian?","response":"Un exemplu în acest sens este ajutorul înainte de aderare, pe care, după cum știm cu toții, se acordă țărilor candidate potențiale, dar care are sens să fie plătit doar dacă statele în cauză abordează în mod eficient problemele lor de corupție sau dacă sunt instituite într-adevăr structurile necesare."},{"question":"Choose from: 1). You might find that your general optometrist has questions about your eye which you may have to ask yourself to see if this is a functional problem. Ask your eye specialist, your psychiatrist, your pharmacist or other medical professional who may be doing a better job of assessing your eyesight. 2). Your optometrist can then tell you if you have any existing eye problems or issues. Before you try eye exercises, you should ask your optometrist if these exercises would benefit your particular set of eyes. 3). Ask whether you should think about wearing glasses whenever you practice intense eye exercise. Your optometrist might recommend contact lenses to improve vision. 4).

Second question: How is Anonymous(Hacker Group) so successful? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options are: (a). no; (b). yes;","response":"First question: How anonymous is the Anonymous hacker group? The Anonymous hacker group is known for its anonymity, which has been crucial in the maneuvers of the collective. The group operates as a decentralized online community without a formal organizational structure or hierarchy. Members often engage in acts of hacktivism, targeting websites, governments, and corporations with DDoS attacks, defacing web pages, releasing confidential data, and spreading messages regarding their intentions or ideologies. The anonymity of the Anonymous hacker group is primarily achieved through several means: 1. Use of digital masks: Anonymous members often hide their identities by using proxies, virtual private networks (VPNs), and the Tor network. These tools allow the members to obfuscate their physical locations, IP addresses, and browsing activity from prying eyes. 2. Pseudonyms: Members of Anonymous often go by pseudonyms or online monikers to keep their true identities hidden. This makes it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to track individuals down. 3. Decentralization and lack of hierarchy: As there is no central leadership or formal structure within Anonymous, it becomes challenging to identify a chain of command or core group of members. This decentralization also helps in disseminating responsibilities and reducing the risk of being identified or caught. 4. Swarming tactics: Anonymous employs swarming tactics that involve launching simultaneous attacks from multiple (sometimes thousands) different sources. This makes it difficult to determine the origins of an attack or pinpoint responsible individuals. Second question: How is Anonymous(Hacker Group) so successful? The success of the Anonymous hacker group can be attributed to several factors: 1. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of the group allows it to function effectively without the need for a formal organizational structure. This makes it difficult for authorities to shut it down, as there is no central authority to target. 2. Shared ideologies: Although Anonymous members may have differing opinions, the common goal of fighting for freedom of speech, information, and digital rights unites the group. This collective ideology often helps rally support for the group's operations. 3. Global reach: The group's global reach, with members from various countries, enables it to coordinate and execute operations across the world, sometimes attacking multiple targets simultaneously. 4. Use of technology: Anonymous is proficient in utilizing tech tools, such as DDoS attacks, social engineering, and malware, to achieve its objectives. The group is also continually learning and adapting to new technologies to stay ahead of its adversaries. 5. Media coverage: Anonymous has been able to garner significant media attention for its operations. This visibility helps the group spread its message and ideas to a wider audience, sometimes recruiting new members in the process. 6. Symbolism: The symbol of the Guy Fawkes mask and the phrase \\"We Are Anonymous\\" resonates with many people who sympathize with the group's cause. This imagery helps unify the group's followers and creates a powerful, recognizable brand. In conclusion, the first question asks about the level of anonymity maintained by the Anonymous hacker group, while the second question inquires about the factors contributing to Anonymous' success. These two questions are not the same. Therefore, the correct answer is: (a) no."},{"question":"Triple: Brock Radunske YOUTH_CLUB Michigan State Spartans (NCAA); 2002-03 Edmonton Oilers season; Brock Radunske ROUND 3; PLAYER Brock Radunske What is a sentence that describes this triple?","response":"In the 2002-03 Edmonton Oilers season, Brock Radunske, a player from Michigan State Spartans (NCAA) Youth Club, was drafted in round 3."},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: As such if you can read this post the nameserver changes has NOT kicked in but should be doing so within the next 1224 hours or so","response":"As such, if you can read this post, the nameserver changes have NOT kicked in.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of magma formation in the ground. Direct effects: 1. If the massive change in the crust leads to an increase in temperature, it could cause more rock to melt, resulting in an increased amount of magma production. 2. The change in the crust may also alter the composition or location of magma chambers, affecting where magma accumulates and how it rises through the crust. 3. If the perturbation causes a shift in tectonic plates, it could lead to increased volcanic activity as the plates interact and create new pathways for magma to rise to the surface. Indirect effects: 1. The perturbation may cause changes in the Earth's mantle, altering the rate at which the mantle material rises to the crust and forms magma. 2. Changes in the crust could also alter the strength or permeability of the rock, affecting how magma moves through the crust and potentially leading to more or less frequent volcanic eruptions. 3. Massive changes in the crust may lead to increased seismic activity, which can, in turn, have an effect on magma movement and eruption processes. Overall, a massive change in the Earth's crust has the potential to significantly impact the formation, movement, and eruption of magma, both directly and indirectly."},{"question":"Q: Test for natural language inference.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...","response":"To answer the question, the full name of the person who campaigned to remove the inscription from the Monument to the Great Fire of London is not mentioned directly in the given context.

As of now, the world population is estimated to be around 7.9 billion people (7,900,000,000). According to recent data from the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States is about 332 million people (332,000,000). To calculate the percentage of the world's population that is American, we can use this simple formula: (American Population / World Population) x 100 By inputting the current numbers, we have: (332,000,000 / 7,900,000,000) x 100 = 4.20% So, the United States represents approximately 4.20% of the global population.

They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations.

Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television. - A presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programs (or segments thereof such as an infomercial advertiser) Nowadays, it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series, to become television personalities. - BBC Entertainment is an international television channel broadcasting comedy, drama, light entertainment, reality and children's programming (some regions only) from the BBC, Channel 4 and other UK production houses.

The controversial plan would have involved destroying \\"unrecognized\\" villages in the Negev, and resettling the displaced Bedouin citizens into \\"recognized\\" villages. Benny Begin, a former lawmaker who helped construct the plan, said Thursday it does not have enough votes in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, to move forward. The Prawer Plan was based on an effort to better integrate Israel's Bedouin population into Israeli society. Following recommendations of a committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan in 2011. The Cabinet also approved more economic development in the Bedouin sector of the Negev, the government said at the time. But the plan to displace Bedouins sparked anger. Last month, Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting. According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would have been affected by the plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000. In a statement Thursday, Begin said he has suggested that the law be halted, but efforts to develop the Bedouin communities in the Negev continue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \\"accepted my suggestion,\\" he said.

From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","response":"Gregor Mendel used common edible pea plants (Pisum sativum) to study inheritance patterns. He selected this species because they could be easily grown, had a relatively short generation time, and exhibited distinct traits that could be tracked from parent to offspring. Mendel's work with these plants laid the foundation for modern genetics, as he discovered fundamental principles such as independent assortment, dominant and recessive traits, heterozygotes and homozygotes, and discontinuous inheritance."},{"question":"Denny asked: If \\"A mother squatting near her child in a stroller.\\" does that mean that \\"A family is hanging out with each other.\\"?

They may be asserting that the said product or service falls short in terms of stability, and thus, should be improved. 2. Intent of the reviewer: On one hand, it seems that the reviewer is providing constructive criticism, bringing the attention of the manufacturer/service provider to this apparent shortcoming. This feedback can be invaluable in helping to enhance or rectify the product/service, ultimately leading to an overall improvement in the user experience. 3. Presentation of review: With only three words, a clear rating is not given and the rest of the context could provide valuable information for the company and other users. The lack of elaboration and details does not give readers a comprehensive understanding of the specific issues encountered by the reviewer. Consequently, a minimal rating is instructed.

Solution 1: Loosening and gently pulling off the helmet manually. This solution involves carefully loosening the helmet or mask from your face and then gently and gradually pulling it off until it is completely detached. Pros: 1. Simple and straightforward: No specialized tools or equipment are needed for this method. You can do this yourself with relative ease. 2. Control over the process: By manually removing the helmet, you can ensure that the process is executed with care and with a minimal risk of damaging the costume or causing any discomfort. Cons: 1. Potential for damage: The helmet and/or costume might have some delicate parts, which can accidentally be damaged during this hands-on method. 2. Discomfort or injury: If the helmet is not loosened enough, yanking it off could potentially cause some discomfort or bruises. It is vital to ensure that it's properly loosened before pulling it off to avoid any mishaps. Solution 2: Using a specialized tool, equipment, or product that aids in loosening and removing the helmet safely. This solution might involve using a device that helps in expanding the helmet's interior or by applying a gentle lubricant that makes it easy to slide off. Pros: 1. Reduced risk of damage: By using a specialized tool, equipment, or product, you can minimize the risk of damaging any delicate parts of the helmet or costume. 2. Comfort and safety: With a tool specifically designed for helmet removal, the chances of discomfort or injury are significantly reduced. 3. Solution tailored to specific helmet or costume: Some costumes may have unique designs or materials that would benefit from a specialized approach. Cons: 1. Cost: Investing in specialized tools or equipment that is designed for this specific purpose may lead to additional costs. 2. Accessibility: Such devices may not be readily available, requiring time and effort to locate a suitable product or tool. 3. Learning curve: Acquiring the specialized tool is one step, but learning to use it correctly and efficiently also requires time and practice so as not to damage or compromise the integrity of the helmet or costume in the process. After thoroughly evaluating both solutions, it is evident that Solution 1 (loosening and gently pulling off the helmet manually by hand) is the better option. It not only offers greater simplicity, lower costs, and more control over the process but also ensures that most individuals can comfortably execute it without risking significant discomfort or damage to the costume.

He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Context: Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a special programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird. Attenborough was named the most trusted celebrity in the UK in a 2006 Reader's Digest poll, and in 2007 he won The Culture Show's Living Icon Award. He has also been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten \\"Heroes of Our Time\\" according to New Statesman magazine. In September 2009, London's Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development. In December 2013, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Bristol. In 2012, Attenborough was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork - the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. The same year, Attenborough featured in the BBC Radio 4 series The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK \\"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands\\". In May 2016, it was announced that a new British polar research ship will be named RRS Sir David Attenborough in his honour. While an Internet poll suggesting the name of the ship had the most votes for Boaty McBoatface, Science Minister Jo Johnson said there were \\"more suitable names\\", and the official name was eventually picked up from one of the more favoured choices. However, one of its research subs will be named \\"Boaty\\" in recognition of the public vote. Question: What recognition has Attenborough received for his efforts?. Whats the answer?","response":"Sir David Attenborough, a famous nature person who talks about animals and plants on TV, has received many awards and recognitions for his work. People love and trust him a lot. Some of the cool things he got include being named the most trusted celebrity, winning a Living Icon Award, and being called one of the top ten \\"Heroes of Our Time\\". He also has a special room called the Attenborough Studio in a big museum in London. A big ship that will study cold places is named after him, called the RRS Sir David Attenborough, and a small underwater robot on that ship is named \\"Boaty\\" because people voted for a funny name online."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales Answer:","response":"The final step of the described process is: The bales are transported to recycling facilities or other designated locations for further processing or disposal.

Movie title: Lisa and the Devil Movie plot: [note: this synopsis is only for Mario Bava's true and original Lisa and the Devil (1973), not the re-shot, re-edited version 'The House of Exorcism' (1975)]Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic, Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps, apparently dead. Lisa...

Article: Harry Houdini was a man who astonished and attracted many people during his life. Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive. Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money. When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe. It was the right move. Harry's persistence and... Question: It can be inferred that Houdini's death was _ .

Options: - cup - cabinet - cardboard box - stumble - backpack Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"If you want to bring a sealed drink with you, the best option among the given choices would be a backpack. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Cup: A cup is meant for holding liquid when you want to drink it, but it doesn't provide a secure place to store a sealed drink while on the move. The drink might fall out easily or become unsealed if placed in the cup. 2. Cabinet: Cabinets are usually stationary and are used for storing items at home or in an office. It is not suitable for bringing a sealed drink with you while out, as it cannot be carried around conveniently. 3. Cardboard box: A cardboard box can provide protection to the sealed drink, but it would be inconvenient to carry while out. Also, a cardboard box can become easily damaged if it gets wet or damp, which is not ideal for carrying a sealed drink. 4. Stumble: \\"Stumble\\" is not an object or a container for carrying a drink. It's an action (to trip or lose balance), so it's not applicable in this context. 5. Backpack: A backpack is an ideal choice for bringing a sealed drink with you. It is a portable, wearable container specifically designed to carry various items while traveling or on the go. You can safely put the sealed drink inside the backpack, and it will be protected from damage, as well as be easy to carry along with any other belongings.

Therefore, she obeyed all of Remy's commands. Given the context: Why did Tracy do this? Possible answers: subvert Remy's authority through insubordination, maintain her independence and express free will, was in the military and Remy was her commanding officer Answer:","response":"Tracy obeyed all of Remy's commands because she was in the military and Remy was her commanding officer. In the context provided, it is mentioned that Tracy always did as she was told, which indicates a high level of discipline and commitment to following rules and orders. This behavior is consistent with someone who serves in the military, as military personnel are expected to follow orders and maintain a strict level of discipline in order to ensure operational efficiency and effectiveness. In a military setting, chain of command is crucial for the smooth functioning of the organization and the success of its missions. The chain of command is the order in which authority and responsibility are delegated from the highest-ranking officer down to the lowest-ranking enlisted personnel. This hierarchy ensures that everyone knows their role in the organization, their responsibilities, and to whom they report. As a result, military personnel are expected to follow the orders of their superior officers without question, unless those orders are deemed unlawful or morally wrong. In Tracy's case, obeying Remy's commands would not only demonstrate her commitment to the chain of command but also her understanding of the importance of following orders to maintain the military's overall discipline and effectiveness. By obeying Remy's commands, Tracy is fulfilling her duty as a subordinate and contributing to the success of her unit's objectives. The other possible answers, such as subverting Remy's authority through insubordination or maintaining her independence and expressing free will, are inconsistent with Tracy's demonstrated behavior of consistently doing as she is told. These answers suggest a defiance of authority or a desire for personal autonomy, which would contradict Tracy's adherence to following orders and her dedication to the military's organizational structure. Therefore, it can be concluded that Tracy obeyed all of Remy's commands because she was in the military, and Remy was her commanding officer."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given dialogue, and you have to find the most critical location in the given conversation.

Yes The sentence \\"It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World War II\\" answers the question, \\"What was located on the site that is now the Queen's Gallery?\\" by indicating that the location was previously the site of a chapel that was destroyed during an air raid in World War II. The Queen's Gallery is an art gallery at Buckingham Palace in London, England. It was established in 1962 and showcases art from the Royal Collection, which includes a variety of paintings, sculptures, and other artwork from various periods and artistic styles. This gallery is open to the public and offers guided tours and educational events. It is important to know the history of the site to better understand the context in which the Queen's Gallery was built. World War II had a significant impact on the United Kingdom, with air raids causing widespread destruction across many cities, including London. Many historical sites and buildings were damaged or destroyed during this time, including the chapel that once stood on the site where the Queen's Gallery is now located. In the aftermath of World War II, various reconstruction efforts were undertaken throughout the UK to rebuild and revitalize damaged cities and sites. The decision to construct the Queen's Gallery on the site of the destroyed chapel was likely influenced by the desire to create a space dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of art and culture, as well as to provide a lasting testament to the resilience and determination of the British people in overcoming the challenges of the war. In summary, the sentence provided answers the question by confirming that the Queen's Gallery occupies the site where a chapel destroyed in World War II once stood. This information provides valuable context for understanding the history of the site and the circumstances that led to the establishment of the Queen's Gallery."},{"question":"Article: Because your child is a toddler, she should have a toddler-sized bike. If the bike is too big, your child won’t be able to reach the pedals, so take her to pick out the bike when you purchase it. To determine if the bike is the right size: Help your child to get on to the bike. Have her stand above the top pipe of the frame with both feet on the ground. If she can do this comfortably, the bike is the appropriate size. Seat height is very important for proper pedaling. Begin by putting the bike seat at its lowest level so that your child can practice pushing the bike (rather than pedalling). Once your child is ready to start pedalling, adjust the seat so that it is consistent with your child’s height. To determine the seat height, make sure that your child can reach the pedal with her whole foot when the pedal is the lowest position. It is very likely that your child will tip over or fall off the bike while she learns how to pedal. Because of this, a helmet is of the utmost importance. Fit the helmet so that when it is strapped to your child’s head, it doesn’t wiggle very much, but is also not glued to your child’s head. The helmet should also sit levelly across your child’s forehead.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The reason being, the hypothesis introduces an unrelated element, which is \\"how to spell your own name.\\" This element is not related to the concept of net debt or the OECD definition of net financial liabilities. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: The net debt concept is based on the OECD definition of net financial liabilities that can be calculated by subtracting financial assets from financial liabilities. This premise is providing a definition for the net debt concept, which is a financial term. Net debt refers to the amount of money a business or government owes, adjusted for its financial assets, following the OECD definition of net financial liabilities. In theory, a higher net debt indicates a higher financial burden and risk for an organization. Hypothesis: The net debt concept is based on the OECD definition of net financial liabilities along with how to spell your own name. This hypothesis attempts to connect two unrelated topics: a financial concept (net debt) and personal information (how to spell your own name). It is incorrect to associate these two concepts because they are not related in any way. Knowing how to spell your own name has no bearing on understanding or defining the net debt concept. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not accurate, and we cannot accept that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise provides a clear definition of the net debt concept, whereas the hypothesis introduces an unrelated and irrelevant element to the definition."},{"question":"Gabriel was very jealous of my friendship with him , too .

Would \\"Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","response":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. The process of making tofu involves: 1. Soaking: Soybeans are soaked in water to soften them, which makes it easier to separate their components. This step also helps to hydrate the beans and increase their volume. 2. Grinding: The soaked soybeans are then ground into a smooth paste. This is usually done using a specialized grinder or blender for large-scale production. Smaller-scale tofu makers may use a mortar and pestle or a food processor to achieve a similar result. 3. Cooking: The ground soybean paste is then cooked, usually by boiling, to deactivate enzymes and eliminate any potential harmful components, such as lectins and trypsin inhibitors. This cooking process also helps to improve the flavor, texture, and digestibility of the final product. 4. Extracting Soy Milk: The cooked soybean paste is strained through a fine cloth or sieve to separate the liquid soy milk from the solid residue, known as okara. The resulting soy milk is then typically heated to further improve its quality. 5. Coagulating: Coagulating agents, such as magnesium chloride (nigari), calcium sulfate (gypsum), or glucono delta-lactone (GDL), are added to the heated soy milk. These agents cause the proteins in the soy milk to coagulate, forming curds. 6. Pressing: The curds are then transferred to a mould, usually lined with cheesecloth or a similar material, and pressure is applied to remove excess liquid, or whey. The duration and intensity of the pressing process help to determine the firmness of the final tofu product. 7. Finalizing: Once the desired firmness is achieved, the tofu is removed from the mould and, in some cases, briefly submerged in cold water to firm up its texture. It is then ready to be packaged, sold, and consumed. This entire process results in tofu, a versatile plant-based food product made from soybeans that can be used in a variety of culinary applications."},{"question":"Q: Generate a correct and concise answer for the question based on the words in the context.

He will transport anything, no questions asked, from Point A to Point B, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule #1: \\"No new deals, when it's a deal, it's a deal\\", Rule #2: \\"No names\\", and Rule #3: \\"Don't open the package\\".

After one gang member is killed by the others, Frank leaves with the remaining robbers. On delivery to their destination, they foist new money on Frank to drive further from the city. He refuses the deal, again adhering to Rule #1. The robbers escape in another car, and Frank leaves. Frank returns to his mansion in the south of France, and he finds out via the news that the gang was caught after crashing their getaway car in a pursuit. Later, local police Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), who happens to be a close acquaintance, arrives to question Frank about the robbery, since his make and model of car was the same used in the robbery. However, despite his suspicions about Frank's involvement, Tarconi has no concrete proof about the heist (due to Frank cleaning up the car and changing the licence plate) and leaves his Villa.

Chandler was the second overall pick of the 2001 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers, then was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls. He has also played for the New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Dallas Mavericks, and New York Knicks. As starting center for Dallas, he played an integral role in the franchise's first NBA championship in 2011. Context: Tyson Chandler was selected 2nd overall by the Los Angeles Clippers, who immediately traded his rights to the Chicago Bulls for former NBA Rookie of the Year Award recipient Elton Brand. The Bulls intended to pair Chandler with fellow high school phenomenon Eddy Curry in the front court. However, while both players had stretches of success during their time with the Bulls, they rarely coincided. In Chandler's case, back problems were a recurring issue throughout his career, particularly during the 2003-04 season. During the early part of his career, Chandler feuded with Brendan Haywood of the Washington Wizards and Amar'e Stoudemire of the Phoenix Suns. Later, although the feuds became less frequent, Chandler struggled with foul trouble, which limited his playing time. Chandler also played a major role in the Bulls' playoff run in the 2004-05 season. Finding a role as a fourth-quarter defensive specialist, with notable game-saving blocks against stars like Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony, he was rewarded with a long-term deal to remain with the Chicago Bulls for the next six years, reportedly worth close to 63 million. With Curry's departure after the 2004-05 season, Chandler became the last member of the Bulls left from the Jerry Krause era. During the 2005-2006 season, Chandler's biggest impact was on defense, but he struggled again with foul problems and averaged only 5.3 points per game. Due in part to his sub-par playoff performance and the Bulls' signing of four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace in the off-season after the 2005-2006 season, Bulls GM John Paxson began to consider moving Chandler. On July 5, 2006, the Bulls and the Hornets verbally agreed to a trade that would send Chandler to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for J. R. Smith and P.J. Brown. The deal was finalized the following week. Question: Did Chandlers came back to Bulls after he was traded to Hornets? Answer:","response":"No, Tyson Chandler did not come back to the Chicago Bulls after he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets. After playing for the Hornets, he continued his career with other teams, but he never returned to play for the Bulls again."},{"question":"To begin your free file analysis simply draganddrop your T3 file inside the dotted lines below or click Browse My Computer and select your file Please fix the punctuation.","response":"To begin your free file analysis, simply drag and drop your T3 file inside the dotted lines below, or click \\"Browse My Computer\\" and select your file."},{"question":"Article: I am starting this GoFundMe page for my wife Lisa Brown. We started one last year for her medical bills and going to Cleveland Clinic. We made the trip 5 times last year and 1 time to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami this year to see about a possible transplant. None of the Dr's were able to help get Lisa back on the road to recovery. As some of you may know, from previous articles, Lisa was in People Magazine last year spreading awareness for this HORRIBLE syndrome, SMAS. (Feel free to GOOGLE Lisa Brown SMAS, you will see all the articles about her) She was also later diagnosed with Gastroparesis. She spent a lot of time trying to help others, which i know she has. She dedicated so much time trying to cheer up anyone who was down. She would handmake personal cards for people who were/are sick, down about something, or just needed a little brightness in their day. She still continues to do this, however it is extremely hard for her to make time because she is so sick and weak. This October she entered into hospice care because she was declining so quickly. They have been trying to help keep her symptoms under control and trying their best to keep her pain free. Her overall health has and is declining rapidly now. I, her husband, am taking off of work on FMLA, and not getting paid, to spend the rest of the time she has with her. I am starting this fund to help pay for anything that she may want to keep her happy and comfortable in the last days she will be with us. It will also help cover the cost of her Memorial and for taking off work with no pay. We appreciate any help you may be able to give.

Thank you much, The Browns Share now to help this campaign Share Tweet 448 shares on Facebook shares on Facebook ||||| Lisa Brown, the 34-year-old woman who was slowly starving to death because of a rare disease she’d fought for six years, died at her home in Brookfield, Wisconsin, on Saturday night, her husband confirms to PEOPLE. “The last thing I said to her was, ‘Go be free,’ ” her husband, Patrick Brown, says. “I already miss her so much. I wish I could see her every day but she’s now at peace.” She was able to plan her own funeral and made one rule very clear: No black allowed. “Lisa said everyone has to wear bright colors and tell fun stories about her,” he says. “She even made a thank you card to everyone who comes. It’s beautifully decorated and shows an open gate.” Throughout Brown’s twenties, she was healthy, happy and excited for her future with her husband. But that all quickly changed when she became very ill shortly after turning 28. The 5’10” former model and substance abuse counselor began to lose weight and couldn’t figure out why. Her clothing became loose, she started vomiting after every meal and was barely able to move from severe stomach pain. When she finally stepped on a scale, she was shocked to see she weighed just 112 lbs. (down from 140 lbs., her normal weight). In December 2013, doctors at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee were finally able to make a diagnosis: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a rare digestive-system disorder where part of the small intestine is pinched, blocking food from getting through. After a corrective surgery didn’t help, doctors were at a loss as to what else was wrong. With her mother and best friend, Patricia Neuhauser, she flew to the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, to meet with a team with experts on SMAS. Of the 400 cases ever reported, they’ve treated 14 of those patients. Unable to get an intestinal transplant — something Brown was told could potentially save her life — she knew she’d continue to decline. Patricia says insurance wouldn’t cover the hefty bill that her mother estimates would end up being over 1 million. While some patients with Brown’s condition also have an eating disorder, Dr. Matthew Kroh who treated her at the Cleveland Clinic, says that there is no indication that she suffered from one. “Lisa is not anorexic or bulimic,” he told PEOPLE in 2015. Brown, who was just 77 lbs. when she died, stayed strong until her very last breath. Patrick vowed to be with her until she died. “I’ll do anything for her,” he says. “We’ve always made a really great team.” He’s also created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of her memorial and for the money he’s lost for taking off work to be by her side full time. RELATED VIDEO: From Modeling to Intensive Care: ‘I’m Starving to Death and I Can’t Help It’ On hospice care at home since October, she was still able to cook her husband an occasional dinner and work on her favorite pastime, arts and crafts. Days before her death, Brown told PEOPLE she was ready to end her long and grueling battle. “I’m not giving up,” she said, “I’ve just been fighting for so long. My body can’t take it.” ||||| A Brookfield woman beset by a rare condition is back in the hospital as her battle against her own body continues. After years of suffering from superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS), Lisa Brown remains determined to be not only a voice for the disorder, but also to win her own case. SMAS is a rare disorder that causes extreme weight loss and malnutrition. in the summer of 2012, Lisa found herself having difficulty eating and keeping food down. By winter, she had lost enough weight that her clothes weren't fitting and she had lost around 15 pounds. Three years later, Lisa was buoyed by hope that a surgery at a clinic in Cleveland this summer might allow her to reclaim health. For the most part, she has been bound to her residence because she has to be hooked up to a total parenteral nutrition system that delivers nutrients to her body intravenously. The surgery was intended to allow Lisa to switch to a feeding tube system that would give her more mobility and the ability to leave the house. Lisa has continued to use the feeding tube system since that surgery; however, in recent weeks, she has found herself losing weight again. Lisa's mother, Pat Neuhauser, regularly sends emails updating her daughter's status to interested parties. Last week, Pat informed them that Lisa had been checked into Elmbrook Memorial Hospital. \\"I had been getting almost 2,000 calories a day on that feeding tube. I really didn't put a lot of weight on with the tube, but the little bit I did gain, I was okay with that,\\" Lisa said. \\"When I start to lose that, I become concerned. I lost about 5 or 6 pounds in the last 10 weeks. That's like the average person losing 20.\\" Lisa is currently down to 86 pounds, the same weight that she was this spring before discovering the Cleveland clinic. \\"I'm always in pain, but I'm used to that and can usually handle it. The severity has increased over the last 6 to 8 weeks,\\" Lisa said. While the surgery over the summer has proven to be successful, it has led to further complications with Lisa being able to retain her body weight. \\"In October testing had revealed that the surgery had indeed worked and everything was passing through, but once it reached my small intestine, that's where everything gets completely hung up,\\" Lisa said. At that point, doctors in Cleveland recommended that Lisa pursue a small intestine transplant. However, in order to do so, Lisa will have to find yet another doctor in yet another city due to her insurance not covering the transplant in Cleveland. \\"I will have to seek out a hospital either in Miami or in Indianapolis,\\" Lisa said. \\"It's so extreme to have a small intestine transplant, so we're also hoping that there might be a different, less extreme option.\\" Despite the recent setback, Lisa is adamant that she is going to continue to fight SMAS and advocate for others suffering from the disorder. Lisa admits that in her current state, she isn't able to devote quite as much time to the board, but she is committed to staying involved. \\"Before I would provide links or I'd mail them information and really, really get involved,\\" Lisa said. \\"Now, I might just refer them to a website. But I'm on there every day.\\" While the board helps Lisa to stay connected with others going through the same fight, she notes that it also can bring bitter reminders. \\"One of the friends of mine on the support board just passed away Saturday in her sleep. She was diagnosed with SMAS and had a surgery scheduled but couldn't get in until January,\\" Lisa said. \\"It's just another example of how waiting is what kills us.\\" For now, Lisa plans to stay at Elmbrook until she feels strong and well enough to travel again, at which point she will continue to pursue a transplant or finding another option. \\"I would just like to thank everyone their prayers and well-wishes and support,\\" Lisa said. \\"It really has been overwhelming. It's still what holds me up when I'm so weak. It's really hard to stay positive, but because of the people who have supported me, I've been able to do that.\\" For those interested in supporting Lisa and her family with their medical and travel expenses or receiving updates from Lisa herself, go to http://www.gofundme.com/lisabrown. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The gastroenterologist took one look at her prior CT scans and angiograms to give her a diagnosis. (There have only been 400 documented cases of SMAS to date.) \\"She could see the pinched area of my intestine very clearly in the scan and the actual doctors reports. There were also notations by other doctors' about the pinch, suggesting further investigation for superior mesenteric artery syndrome, says Lisa. \\"But nobody ever told me, which is frustrating. Now, I tell people to be their own advocate and check your own medical records.\\" Most Popular But for the first time, Lisa had good news: A corrective surgery could relieve symptoms by rerouting food through a new passageway and bypassing the blocked intestine. But first, she had to gain weight — and strength. \\"I was in such bad shape that the doctor didn't think I would make it through surgery.\\" She went on a nasal feeding tube for three weeks and had the procedure in February 2012. For a few months, Lisa was able to keep down the foods she gradually reintroduced into her diet, even though she still had pain. \\"It was my little honeymoon period. I still couldn't eat large portions, but I didn't have any food restrictions.\\" She was able to go on their annual trip to Playa del Carmen. \\"My doctor said it seemed to be a total fix.\\" But in May, the vomiting returned. \\"It was pretty devastating and progressively became worse,\\" she says. A barrage of tests showed no additional explanations. To keep her malnutrition at bay, a nasal feeding tube was put in, followed by one surgically inserted into her stomach, and then finally a vascular feeding system. But still, she kept wasting away. The New Normal For 20 hours a day, Lisa is hooked up to the vascular feeding system through a port in her chest. After a restless night's sleep, her nutrient infusion ends at 8 a.m. and she has \\"four hours of freedom\\" before hooking up again at noon. \\"No matter how sick I'm feeling or how much pain I'm in, I get out of the house because I'm trapped here the rest of the time.\\" Lisa will run errands or go to the craft store. When Patrick, an engineer who travels frequently for work, is home, the couple go to their favorite coffee shop. A home, she's back on the pump — and on the phone for hours. \\"I have to deal with the insurance company and doctors offices: disputing bills and claims, making appointments, and getting things approved,\\" she says. \\"It's exhausting.\\" She finds solace in creating crafts and art projects, especially jewelry and intricate cards to send to people she knows through an SMAS Facebook support group. Her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, lives nearby, so when Patrick is on the road, she comes over to help her only child. \\"She helps with all the things I can't do anymore and will spend hours on the computer researching and looking for physicians,\\" says Lisa. \\"She puts everything she has into it. I'm blessed to have her and I'll never ever take her for granted.\\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Finding Answers \\"I was being shrugged off by the doctors at this point,\\" Lisa recalls of this winter. \\"I just kept on the TPN [total parenteral nutrition, her vascular feeding tube] and losing weight and losing weight.\\" Inspired by her friends on a Facebook support group, Lisa made an 11-minute video of her story and posted it on YouTube in January 2015. \\"The world needs to see and understand,\\" she says. \\"I thought, What does it matter if people see me in this light? They already see me and make a judgment. I might as well put it to good use.\\" Lisa heard about the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, a center for experts on SMAS, through her support group. In March, she booked the first available appointment for July 15. \\"I thought, I'm not going to live until then.\\" Desperate, her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, sent the video and a local news story on her to specialists at the clinic, which got their attention. They got her an earlier appointment, and a local business flew Lisa, who was too weak to take a commercial flight or drive, on their company jet for free. At the hospital, Lisa met with Dr. Matthew Kroh, director of surgical endoscopy. Their goal was to combat her malnutrition and find out what else was wrong besides her SMAS. \\"I was so ill when I arrived that it took two and a half weeks to stabilize me before they even felt comfortable doing any testing,\\" she explains. After she gained 6 pounds (bringing her weight to 94 pounds), doctors performed a test with a SmartPill, which was placed endoscopically in her stomach and traveled her intestinal tract, communicating hormone and vitamin levels, acidity, and digestion time. In early July, she got her second diagnosis: gastroparesis. While research on the causes of gastroparesis is limited, Lisa says it can be triggered by abdominal surgery. \\"The nerve endings that allow your stomach to pump to process the food and push it down your intestines are somehow damaged,\\" she explains. \\"They're paralyzed so your stomach can't drain.\\" Lisa Brown, in a January 2015 photo shoot for her video. Lois Bielefeld Photography Putting Their Relationship to the Test The couple admits that the last several years haven't been easy on their marriage. \\"It's not an equal partnership anymore,\\" Lisa says. \\"I used to be the caretaker: I cleaned, made all the meals, did the planning and shopping. Now, I need everything done for me.\\" But Patrick, who's a problem-solver by nature, struggles with the inability to fix this. \\"It's unbelievably frustrating, disheartening for him to accept that we don't have a solution right now — as he watches his wife die,\\" says Lisa. \\"He's so emotionally supportive of me, but it's torn him apart. I feel extremely guilty that more than half of our marriage has been illness.\\" While that's challenging, Patrick's concern is naturally for his wife.\\"What is it like to watch this? It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through,\\" Patrick says. Being gone so often doesn't help: \\"It's constantly on your mind that your wife is dying but you need to pay the bills. I worry daily, leaving and not knowing what could happen.\\" He admires Lisa's strength and willpower — and tells her she's beautiful all the time. \\"She absolutely is beautiful, on the outside and inside,\\" says Patrick. \\"I probably would have given up a long time ago. She just wants to survive and spread awareness of this horrible illness so that maybe somebody else doesn't have to go through it.\\" Though the pair has good insurance through Patrick's job, the bills keep adding up — especially because much of Lisa's care is specialized and often not covered. Her family has created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs. \\"After insurance, I think our expenses came out to 11,000 for her last 3-week stay in Cleveland,\\" Patrick says. \\"Who knows how long she will be there this time … But money's not worth anything if you don't have anyone to share it with.\\" Hope for the Future On July 15, she had a surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to put in a rejejunostomy feeding tube, which will give her more freedom to move around. Patrick says the surgery was successful. Because he was on a job site in Denver, her mother went with her. \\"Hopefully, Lisa can get some of her life back and have more freedom so she's not hooked up 24 hours a day to the pump. Then they will do some more testing.\\" Adds Lisa, \\"It's not a permanent fix, but this will hopefully get my stomach and my digestive tract working again — and finally keep me strong and stable.\\" Update, January 25, 2017: Tragically, after a five-year struggle with superior mesenteric artery syndrome and gastroparesis, Lisa Brown died on January 21, 2017. She was 34. \\"She was an amazing person,\\" her husband Patrick told GoodHousekeeping.com. \\"As much as she is missed, I am at ease knowing she isn't suffering anymore.\\" ||||| Lisa Brown’s mind frequently drifts back back to her 20s when she was having the time of her life. She went to college, then graduate school and married the love of her life, Patrick. “Everything was perfect,” Brown, now 34, tells PEOPLE. “I couldn’t have been happier.” The 5’10 former model and substance counselor spent her time working, making gourmet meals, frequenting flea markets and driving around in her parents’ classic Mustang convertible with Patrick. She was active and never sitting still. But things quickly took a turn for the worse shortly after her 28th birthday when she began to lose weight and couldn’t figure out why. Her clothing became loose, she started vomiting after every meal and was barely able to move from severe stomach pain. When she finally stepped on a scale, she was shocked to see she weighed just 112 pounds. Lisa Brown at home in Brookfield, Wisconsin Courtesy Lisa Brown As she continued to lose weight, stares and comments from strangers only became worse. “People would say I should eat a burger and they’d ask me why I was starving myself,” she says. “It was very hard to hear but I knew the truth.” Now, three years after a surgery she hoped would fix her ailing body didn’t work, she weighs just 77 pounds and knows she’s out of options. She’s living out her final days at home. “It’s my time to go,” she tells PEOPLE. “I’m done fighting.” Her Six-Year Battle In 2013, Brown was diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a rare digestive-system disorder where part of the small intestine is pinched, blocking food from getting through. The disease causes her to starve to death. “I was hopeful,” says Brown. “I knew it was bad but I thought I’d be one of the lucky ones to survive. ” In July 2015, Brown was down to just 89 pounds and didn’t know if she’d make it to her 33rd birthday. At the time, she sat down with PEOPLE at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where she was being treated for SMAS. To spread awareness about the debilitating syndrome, she created a video titled Be Brave SMAS Warriors, which she posted on YouTube. Her mother, Patricia Neuhauser, 68, then sent the video and a story a local news outlet did on Lisa to specialists at the Cleveland Clinic who are experts on SMAS- although there have only been 400 documented cases to date. Lisa and Patrick Brown on their wedding day. Lisa Brown It immediately caught their attention. After a corrective surgery didn’t help at another hospital, the two relocated from Brookfield, Wisconsin in May, 2015, hoping to get answers. Hooked up to a feeding device 20 hours a day, she went through numerous tests and was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition that prevents the stomach from emptying properly. Six months later, the hospital told Brown that she needed an intestinal transplant. It was something Lisa says she thinks would have worked, but insurance wouldn’t cover the hefty bill that her mother estimates would end up being over 1,000,000. “It was my last chance at surviving,” she says. “But it didn’t happen. It was way too expensive to do on our own.” After leaving the Cleveland Clinic, Lisa and Patrick didn’t give up. In May 2016, they flew to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, one of the few hospitals in the country that offers the transplant. She remembers barely surviving the long trip. “I was really deteriorating at that point,” she recalls, “and they told me I had to gain 20 pounds to have the surgery.” It was an ambitious and unreachable goal that left her feeling disheartened when doctors told her that there was nothing they could do. “I knew then and there I had no shot,” she says. “I couldn’t take it anymore.” Her Final Days Brown, who is now living out her final days with hospice care, still managed to cook Patrick one his favorite meals last week: Chicken green bean casserole. “She just won’t give up,” says Patrick, age 33. “It’s unbelievable. To see her making this meal while she’s so sick says so much.” In October, Brown decided to go to Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care to relieve some of the excruciating pain she was enduring a daily basis. “It’s not a scary thing. It doesn’t mean you’re ready for death; it means you’re finding another way to help your fight,” she says. “It doesn’t mean you’re giving up. I’ve never given up.” Dr. Paul Bullis, Lisa’s physician, says that for numerous reasons she wasn’t a candidate for further treatments after being seen by numerous experts who specialize in SMAS. “Her heart is still very strong,” he says, “and she’s still able to enjoy each day she has left.” While they’re now able to manage her unbearable pain intravenously, they have also given her some closure. “She’s ready to pass away,” he tells PEOPLE. “We just don’t know when.” Patrick, who typically spends more days on the road for work than he does at home, went on family and medical leave from his job in early December without pay to be with her. “I’ll be with her until it’s her time,” he says. “I’ll do anything for her. We’ve always made a really great team.” He’s also created a GoFundMe page to help with the costs of her memorial and for the money he’s lost for taking off work. Courtesy Lisa Brown Patrick has also found strength he never knew he had. “The hardest part is just sitting here watching her suffer,” he says. “But I promised her sickness and in health. I was just hoping for the health.” Brown’s days filled with fresh air, trips to her favorite local coffee shop and arts and crafts store are now mere memories for Lisa and her mother Patricia who lives just down the block from her. “I miss the things we used to do everything together because we are so close,” she tells PEOPLE. “The fun things that a lot of people take for granted. Stopping at the grocery store or anything like that.” When Patricia walks into a shop today that they used to frequent together, she can’t help but tear up. “I miss Lisa every day even though she’s still here,” she says. “My daughter is too young to die. We need more time.” For the past six years, Brown has never lost her determination, but now, she says, it’s her “time to go.” “I’m done fighting,” she says. “I’ve tried everything.” On Tuesday, Patricia and her husband Jack were able to take Brown to get her nails done. Naturally, she had them painted purple, the color for SMAS Awareness day, which is January 28. “It is rare I have the strength to leave the house lately, but mom took me out for this special manicure for a gift,” she wrote on Facebook. “Each day is more of a challenge for me as my body protests every intervention, but it is things like this that lift my spirits to fight another day.” ||||| What is a summary?","response":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a larger piece of information or text.

The statement claims that all mail carriers on the Pony Express were cowboys in classic chaps and hats. Step 1: Understand the context of the statement. The Pony Express was a mail delivery service that operated from April 1860 to October 1861 in the United States. It was known for its fast delivery of mail across a large distance, with relay stations and riders who changed horses frequently to maintain speed. Step 2: Examine the claim about mail carriers being cowboys. The term \\"cowboy\\" typically refers to individuals who work with cattle, primarily in North America, and are associated with a certain image characterized by boots, hats, chaps, and other specific attire. Step 3: Analyze the historical context of Pony Express riders. Pony Express riders were known for being young, lightweight, and experienced horsemen. While some riders may have been cowboys in the traditional sense, it is incorrect to claim that all Pony Express riders fit that description. Step 4: Check the statement against historical facts. Pony Express riders had to be able to ride well and quickly across challenging terrain. They were selected for their riding skills rather than their clothing or association with the cowboy archetype. As such, the attire of Pony Express riders may have varied and not necessarily included classic chaps and hats. In conclusion, the statement \\"Mail carriers on the Pony Express were all cowboys in classic chaps and hats\\" is inaccurate as it misrepresents the actual characteristics of Pony Express riders.

After demonstrating his potential as an accomplished high school quarterback, Brees caught the attention of various college teams. He chose to attend Purdue University in Indiana, where he became a Boilermaker from 1997 to 2000.

The clock is 500 feet tall and powered by the Earth's thermal cycles, Bezos said in a tweet Tuesday. \\"It's a special Clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking,\\" a blog post signed by Bezos says. The clock has been in the works for nearly three decades, according to the post, and is designed to tick once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. The project was initiated by Danny Hillis in 1989. Bezos said he's been \\"helping Danny with the project for the last half dozen years.\\" \\"Building a Clock inside a remote mountain is a big task. Construction is under way, and we're making progress every day,\\" the post reads. ||||| Some people say that they feel the future is slipping away from them. To me, the future is a big tractor-trailer slamming on its brakes in front of me just as I pull into its slip stream. I am about to crash into it. When I was a kid, three decades ago, the future was a long way off - so was the turn of the millennium. Dates like 1984 and 2001 were comfortably remote. But the funny thing is, that in all these years, the future that people think about has not moved past the millennium. It's as if the future has been shrinking one year, per year, for my entire life. 2005 is still too far away to plan for and 2030 is too far away to even think about. Why bother making plans when everything will change? How we name our years is part of the problem. Those three zeros in the millennium form a convenient barrier, a reassuring boundary by which we can hold on to the present and isolate ourselves from whatever comes next. Still, there is more to this shortening of the future than dates. It feels like something big is about to happen: graphs show us the yearly growth of populations, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, Net addresses, and Mbytes per dollar. They all soar up to form an asymptote just beyond the turn of the century: The Singularity. The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand. I think of the oak beams in the ceiling of College Hall at New College, Oxford. Last century, when the beams needed replacing, carpenters used oak trees that had been planted in 1386 when the dining hall was first built. The 14th-century builder had planted the trees in anticipation of the time, hundreds of years in the future, when the beams would need replacing. Did the carpenters plant new trees to replace the beams again a few hundred years from now? When I tell my friends about the millennium clock, either they get it or they don't. Most of them assume I'm not serious, or if I am, I must be having a midlife crisis. (That's nice, Danny, but why can't you just write a computer program to do the same thing? Or, Maybe you should start another company instead.) My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, Stewart Brand, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It's a Rorschach test - of time. Peter Gabriel, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist Brian Eno felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now. Ten thousand years - the life span I hope for the clock - is about as long as the history of human technology. We have fragments of pots that old. Geologically, it's a blink of an eye. When you start thinking about building something that lasts that long, the real problem is not decay and corrosion, or even the power source. The real problem is people. If something becomes unimportant to people, it gets scrapped for parts; if it becomes important, it turns into a symbol and must eventually be destroyed. The only way to survive over the long run is to be made of materials large and worthless, like Stonehenge and the Pyramids, or to become lost. The Dead Sea Scrolls managed to survive by remaining lost for a couple millennia. Now that they've been located and preserved in a museum, they're probably doomed. I give them two centuries - tops. The fate of really old things leads me to think that the clock should be copied and hidden. The idea of hiding the clock to preserve it has a natural corollary, but it takes Teller, the professional magician, to suggest it without shame: \\"The important thing is to make a very convincing documentary about building the clock and hiding it. Don't actually build one. That would spoil the myth if it was ever found.\\" In a way, Teller is right. The only clocks that have ever really survived over the long run (like the water clock of Su Sung, or the giant hourglass of Uqbar) have survived in books, drawings, and stories. In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last. Just before Jonas Salk died, I was lucky enough to sit next to him at a dinner. I didn't know him well, but in past conversations he had always encouraged my more mystical lines of thought. I was sure he would like the millennium clock. I was disappointed by his response: \\"Think about what problem you are trying to solve. What question are you really trying to ask?\\" I had never thought of the clock as a question. It was more of an answer, although I wasn't sure to what. I talked more, about the shrinking future, about the oak trees. \\"Oh, I see,\\" Salk said. \\"You want to preserve something of yourself, just as I am preserving something of myself by having this conversation with you.\\" I remembered this a few weeks later, when he died. \\"Be sure you think carefully about exactly what you want to preserve,\\" he said. OK, Jonas, OK, people of the future, here is a part of me that I want to preserve, and maybe the clock is my way of explaining it to you: I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future. Danny Hillis is an inventor, scientist, and computer designer. He pioneered the concept of massively parallel computers that is now the basis of most new supercomputer designs. Hillis is currently researching the creation of software by a process analogous to biological evolution. ||||| Image copyright Eyewire Inc A clock designed to run for ten millennia without human intervention is now under construction. The 10,000 Year Clock is a project of the Long Now Foundation, a non-profit organisation that wants to make \\"long-term thinking more common\\". It is being built on property owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, beneath a mountain in the middle of a desert in Texas, There is currently no completion date scheduled for the project. The clock's creator, American inventor Danny Hillis, first publicly shared the concept in an essay for Wired in 1995. In it, he describes his vision of a timepiece that ticks once every year, with a century hand that moves just once every 100 years and a cuckoo that emerges every 1,000. The clock is designed to capture energy from changes in temperature to power its timekeeping apparatus, according to the Long Now Foundation. But it will not be able to store enough energy to display the time unless visitors \\"wind\\" it with a hand-turned wheel. Bezos shared a video of the clock's construction on Twitter on Tuesday: The project has attracted the support of influential artists and thinkers in addition to Bezos, whose contribution of 42 million (£30m) makes him its largest financial backer. British musician Brian Eno, famous for his ambient compositions, has built a mechanical melody generator that will produce a different chime sequence every day for 10,000 years. Like the clock hands, the chimes will only work if visitors power the clock. The first prototype of the clock, which was completed in 1999, is now on display at the Science Museum in London. According to the Long Now Foundation, visitors will be able to hike to the site to see the finished product. ||||| The full scale 10,000 Year Clock is now under construction. While there is no completion date scheduled, we do plan to open it to the public once it is ready. The essay below by Long Now board member Kevin Kelly discusses what we hope the Clock will be once complete. This is one of several projects by Long Now to foster long-term thinking in the context of the next 10,000 years. Clock in the Mountain by Kevin Kelly There is a Clock ringing deep inside a mountain. It is a huge Clock, hundreds of feet tall, designed to tick for 10,000 years. Every once in a while the bells of this buried Clock play a melody. Each time the chimes ring, it’s a melody the Clock has never played before. The Clock’s chimes have been programmed to not repeat themselves for 10,000 years. Most times the Clock rings when a visitor has wound it, but the Clock hoards energy from a different source and occasionally it will ring itself when no one is around to hear it. It’s anyone’s guess how many beautiful songs will never be heard over the Clock’s 10 millennial lifespan. The Clock is real. It is now being built inside a mountain in western Texas. This Clock is the first of many millennial Clocks the designers hope will be built around the world and throughout time. There is a second site for another Clock already purchased at the top of a mountain in eastern Nevada, a site surrounded by a very large grove of 5,000-year-old bristlecone pines. Appropriately, bristlecone pines are among the longest-lived organisms on the planet. The designers of the Clock in Texas expect its chimes will keep ringing twice as long as the oldest 5 millennia-old bristlecone pine. Ten thousand years is about the age of civilization, so a 10K-year Clock would measure out a future of civilization equal to its past. That assumes we are in the middle of whatever journey we are on – an implicit statement of optimism. The Clock is now being machined and assembled in California and Seattle. Meantime the mountain in Texas is being readied. Why would anyone build a Clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years? Part of the answer: just so people will ask this question, and having asked it, prompt themselves to conjure with notions of generations and millennia. If you have a Clock ticking for 10,000 years what kinds of generational-scale questions and projects will it suggest? If a Clock can keep going for ten millennia, shouldn’t we make sure our civilization does as well? If the Clock keeps going after we are personally long dead, why not attempt other projects that require future generations to finish? The larger question is, as virologist Jonas Salk once asked, “Are we being good ancestors?” The Clock’s inventor introduced the idea of the Clock (in 01995) with this context: I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years. That’s Danny Hillis, a polymath inventor, computer engineer, and designer, inventor and prime genius of the Clock. He and Stewart Brand, a cultural pioneer and trained biologist, launched a non-profit foundation to build at least the first Clock. Fellow traveler and rock musician Brian Eno named the organization The Long Now Foundation to indicate the expanded sense of time the Clock provokes – not the short now of next quarter, next week, or the next five minutes, but the “long now” of centuries. Eno also composed the never-repeating melody generator that rings the Clock’s chimes inside the mountain. Other people unhappy with our society’s short-attention span are part of this group, including me, one of its charter officers. This Clock in the Mountain is being funded and built on property owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com. Bezos is also active in designing the full experience of the Clock. The first step in this multi-decade project was to construct a working 8-foot-tall prototype. This test version was finished (just in time) on New Year’s Eve 1999. At the stroke of midnight, the prototype 10,000-year Clock bonged twice to usher in the new millennia, the year 2000, in front of a small crowd at its temporary home in the Presidio, San Francisco. The Clock now resides in the London Science Museum. Somewhat worrisome, there have been moments when it was not wound. In contrast to the human-scale of the prototype, the Clock in the mountain will be monumental, almost architectural in scale. It will be roughly 200 feet tall. Located under a remote limestone mountain near Van Horn, Texas, it will require a day’s hike to reach its interior gears. Just reaching the entrance tunnel situated 1500 feet above the high scrub desert will leave some visitors out of breath, nicked by thorns, and wondering what they got themselves into. To see the Clock you need to start at dawn, like any pilgrimage. Once you arrive at its hidden entrance in an opening in the rock face, you will find a jade door rimmed in stainless steel, and then a second steel door beyond it. These act as a kind of crude airlock, keeping out dust and wild animals. You rotate its round handles to let yourself in, and then seal the doors behind you. It is totally black. You head into the darkness of a tunnel a few hundred feet long. At the end there’s the mildest hint of light on the floor. You look up. There is a tiny dot of light far away, at the top of top of a 500 foot long vertical tunnel about 12 feet in diameter. There is stuff hanging in the shaft. The dot of light beckons you. You begin the ascent. You start climbing a continuous spiral staircase, winding up the outer rim of the tunnel, rising toward the very faint light overhead. The stairs are carved out of the rock. The material above each step has been removed from the tunnel leaving astoundingly precise rock stairs. To cut the spiral staircase Stuart Kendall of Seattle Solstice invented a special stone slicing robot to continuously grind out the stairs at the rate of a few stairs per day. His robot incrementally creeps downward while the debris falls into the central shaft out of the way. Round the tunnel and up the tube toward the light you head. The first part of the Clock you encounter on the ascent up the spiral staircase is the counterweights of the Clock’s drive system. This is a huge stack of stone disks, about the size of a small car, and weighing 10,000 pounds. Depending on when the clock was last wound, you may have to climb 75 feet before you reach the weights. After you pass the weights, you arrive at the winding station. It is a horizontal windlass, or a capstan like the turnstile on an old sailing vessel that winds up an anchor. It takes two or three visitors to push around the capstan of the clock and to lift its 10,000-pound stones. You rotate around until you can no further. Now the clock is wound. You keep climbing. For the next 70-80 feet of ascent you pass 20 huge horizontal gears (called Geneva wheels), 8 feet in diameter, each weighing 1,000 pounds. This is the mechanical computer that calculates the over 3.5 million different melodies that the chimes will ring inside the mountain over the centuries. The chimes never repeat so that every visitor’s experience is unique, and the calculated variety creates a sense of progressive time, rather than endless recycling. And “calculate” is the correct word, because cut into the gears is an elaborate system of slots and sliding pins, which, much like a Babbage Difference Engine, will perform digital calculations, generating the next sequence of the ten bells. Only the Clock calculates without electricity, using your stored energy to moving its physical logic gates and bits. This is the world’s slowest computer. On days when visitors are there to wind it, the calculated melody is transmitted to the chimes, and if you are there at noon, the bells start ringing their unique one-time-only tune. The 10 chimes are optimized for the acoustics of the shaft space, and they are big. Finally, way out of breath, you arrive at the primary chamber. Here is the face of the Clock. A disk about 8 feet in diameter artfully displays the natural cycles of astronomical time, the pace of the stars and the planets, and the galactic time of the Earth’s procession. If you peer deep into the Clock’s workings you can also see the time of day. But in order to get the correct time, you need to “ask” the clock. When you first come upon the dials the time it displays is an older time given to the last person to visit. If no one has visited in a while, say, since 8 months and 3 days ago, it will show the time it was then. To save energy, the Clock will not move its dials unless they are turned, that is, powered, by a visitor. The Clock calculates the correct time, but will only display the correct time if you wind up its display wheel. So yet another hand-turned wheel awaits your effort to update the face of time. This one is much easier to wind because the dial motion consumes less power than ringing bells. You start winding and the calendar wheels whirr until BING, it stops and it shows the current date and time. So how does the Clock keep going if no one visits it for months, or years, or perhaps decades? If it is let to run down between visits, who would keep resetting it? The Clock is designed to run for 10,000 years even if no one ever visits (although it would not display the correct time till someone visited). If there is no attention for long periods of time the Clock uses the energy captured by changes in the temperature between day and night on the mountain top above to power its time-keeping apparatus. In a place like a top of a mountain, this diurnal difference of tens of degrees in temperature is significant and thus powerful. Thermal power has been used for small mantel clocks before, but it has not been done before at this scale. The differential power is transmitted to the interior of the Clock by long metal rods. As long as the sun shines and night comes, the Clock can keep time itself, without human help. But it can’t ring its chimes for long by itself, or show the time it knows, so it needs human visitors. If the sun shines through the clouds more often than expected, and if the nights are colder than usual, the extra power generated by this difference (beyond what is ordinarily needed to nudge the pendulum) will bleed over into the Clock weights. That means that over time, in ideal conditions, the sun will actually wind up the chimes, and wind them up sufficiently for them to ring when no one is there. The rotating dials, gears, spinning governor, and internal slips of pins and slots within the Clock will be visible only if you bring your own light. The meager dot of light above is not sufficient to see much otherwise. Lights off, the Clock sits in near total darkness, talking to itself in slow clicks, for perhaps years at a time. In the darkness you can hear things moving, crisp non-random pings, like a crude thought trying to form inside a dim unlit brain. Shining your light around the rest of the chamber you’ll see the pendulum and escapement encased in a shield of quartz glass – to keep out dust, air movements, and critters. The pendulum, which governs the timing of the Clock, is a 6-feet-long titanium assembly terminating with football-sized titanium weights. It swings at a satisfyingly slow 10-second period. The slight clicks of its escapement echo loudly in the silence of the mountain. Building something to last 10,000 years requires both a large dose of optimism and a lot of knowledge. There’s a huge geek-out factor in the Clock because the engineering challenges are formidable. What do you build with that won’t corrode in 100 centuries? How do you keep it accurate when no one is around? The Clock’s technical solutions are often ingenious. Almost any kind of artifact can last 10 millennia if stored and cared for properly. We have examples of 5,000-year-old wood staffs, papyrus, or leather sandals. On the other hand, even metal can corrode in a few years of rain. For longevity a 10K year environment is more important than the artifact’s material. The mountain top in Texas (and Nevada) is a high dry desert, and below, in the interior tunnel, the temperature is very even over seasons and by the day (55 degrees F) – another huge plus for longevity since freeze-thaw cycles are as corrosive as water. Dry, dark and stable temperatures are what archivists love. It’s an ideal world for a ceaseless Clock. Still, the Clock is a machine with moving parts, and parts wear down and lubricants evaporate or corrode. Most of the Clock will be made in a marine grade 316 stainless steel. Because the engineering tolerances of the huge Clock are in fractions of an inch, rather than thousandths, the microscopic expansion by a film of rust won’t hurt the time keeping. The main worry of the Clockmakers is that elements of a 10K-year Clock — by definition — will move slowly. The millennial dial creeps so slowly it can be said to not move at all during your lifetime. Metals in contact with each other over those time scales can fuse – defeating the whole purpose of an ongoing timepiece. Dissimilar metals in contact can eat each other in galvanic corrosion. To counteract these tendencies some of the key moving parts of the Clock are non-metal — they are stone and hi-tech ceramics. Ceramics will outlast most metals. We have found shards of clay pots 17,000 years old. And modern ceramics can be as hard as diamonds. All the bearings in the Clock will be engineered ceramic. Because these bearings are so hard, and rotate at very low speed, they require no lubrication – which normally attracts grit and eventually cause wear. There is more than just technology in the mountain. The ticks of time are a very human invention. Astronomical calendars are among the first pieces of culture, and often the mark of civilizations. The cave holds culture. The Clock in the mountain not only plays the music of an ever-changing slow melody, but it will collect cultural expressions of time, ticks to mark the passage of decades and centuries. Off to the side of the main cavern of the Clock are a series of small grottos to explore and collect these notices of time. Their contents will be a surprise. Behind the main chamber’s dials the stairs continue up to the outside summit of the mountain. The shaft above Clock continues to the surface, where its opening to the daylight is capped with a cupola of sapphire glass. This is the only part of the clock visible from outside, on the mountain peak. In this outdoor cupola sits the thermal-difference device to power the timekeeping, and also a solar synchronizer. Every sunny noon, a prism directs sunlight down the shaft and slightly heats up this ingenious mechanical device. That synchronizing signal is transmitted by rods further down to the Clock’s innards, where the imperceptible variations in the length of the day as the earth wobbles on its axis will be compensated so that the Clock can keep its noon on true solar noon. In that way the Clock is self-adjusting, and keeps good time over the centuries. The journey to the Clock in the mountain ends on the summit in light. It is the sun that powers its ringing below. Like a heart beating while we sleep, the Clock in the mountain keeps time even when we pretend the past did not happen and the future will not come. The biggest problem for the beating Clock will be the effects of its human visitors. Over the span of centuries, valuable stuff of any type tends to be stolen, kids climb everywhere, and hackers naturally try to see how things work or break. But it is humans that keep the Clock’s bells wound up, and humans who ask it the time. The Clock needs us. It will be an out of the way, long journey to get inside the Clock ringing inside a mountain. But as long as the Clock ticks, it keeps asking us, in whispers of buried bells, “Are we being good ancestors?” How do you become one of those time-conscious beings who visit and wind the Clock?

(AP) Obamacare consultant Jonathan Gruber is at the mike Tuesday, testifying in front of the House Oversight Committee, answering for a series of what he calls \\"glib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting comments\\" he made concerning the health-care law. The most recent and well-publicized of these are when Gruber was shown on tape saying the Affordable Care Act gamed the system in order to obtain passage and relied on the \\"stupidity of the American voter\\" and a \\"lack of transparency\\" to earn approval. The comments have recast (somewhat) the debate over Obamacare, as Republicans continue to try and undercut and/or get rid of the law, five years after its passage. Gruber's opening statement to the committee includes plenty of apologizing and explaining. Here it is, word for word, along with what he really meant: Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Cummings, and Distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify voluntarily today. I am pleased to be able to address some statements I have made regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the reactions to and interpretations of those statements. I am a Professor of Economics at MIT. I am not a political advisor nor a politician. Translation: I would really rather not be here, but here goes. Also, I'm not really in politics, so I'm not very good at what you might call \\"message control\\" or \\"recognizing that I am on camera.\\" Over the past decade I have used a complex economic microsimulation model to help a number of states and the federal government assess the impact that various legislative options for health care reform might have on the state and federal health care systems, government budgets, and overall economies. I have had the privilege of working for both Democratic and Republican administrations on health care reform efforts. For example, I worked extensively with Governor Romney’s Administration and the Massachusetts legislature to model the impact of Governor Romney’s landmark health reform legislation. Translation: I'm not a partisan hack. I have worked with Republicans, too. I later served as a technical consultant to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and provided similar support to both the Administration and Congress through economic microsimulation modeling of the Affordable Care Act. I did not draft Governor Romney’s health care plan, and I was not the “architect” of President Obama’s health care plan. I ran microsimulation models to help those in the state and federal executive and legislative branches better assess the likely outcomes of various possible policy choices. Translation: Reports labeling me as the \\"architect\\" of Obamacare were overzealous. I wasn't paid to write the bill (though I do conveniently fail to mention that I was paid 400,000 for my work on the law and that I gave advice to the president in the Oval Office when passage of the law was in doubt.) After the passage of the ACA, I made a series of speeches around the nation endeavoring to explain the law’s implications for the U.S. health care system from the perspective of a trained economist. Many of these speeches were to technical audiences at economic and academic conferences. Translation: Who could have known that popping off to a bunch of nerds would come back to bite me? Over the past weeks a number of videos have emerged from these appearances. In excerpts of these videos I am shown making a series of glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting comments. I apologized for the first of these videos earlier. But the ongoing attention paid to these videos has made me realize that a fuller accounting is necessary. I would like to begin by apologizing sincerely for the offending comments that I made. In some cases I made uninformed and glib comments about the political process behind health care reform. I am not an expert on politics and my tone implied that I was, which is wrong. Translation: I am very, very sorry. I misrepresented my involvement in the strategy of Obamacare. So when I said that the law was drafted to avoid the \\"tax\\" designation by the Congressional Budget Office (who's going to vote for a tax, after all?), I was blowing smoke. Mea culpa. In other cases I simply made insulting and mean comments that are totally uncalled for in any situation. I sincerely apologize both for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion. It is never appropriate to try to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others. I know better. I knew better. I am embarrassed, and I am sorry. Translation: I am very, very sorry, and I'm going to keep saying that. And again, I was speaking out of school. In addition to apologizing for my unacceptable remarks, I would like to clarify some misconceptions about the content and context of my comments. Let me be very clear: I do not think that the Affordable Care Act was passed in a non-transparent fashion. The issues I raised in my comments, such as redistribution of risk through insurance market reform and the structure of the Cadillac tax, were roundly debated throughout 2009 and early 2010 before the law was passed. Reasonable people can disagree about the merits of these policies, but it is completely clear that these issues were debated thoroughly during the drafting and passage of the ACA. Translation: Whatever I said about \\"lack of transparency,\\" taxes and the CBO, Obamacare was debated endlessly, so even if it was written deceptively, it would have been pretty hard to hide the true nature of the law. I also would like to clarify some misperceptions about my January 2012 remarks concerning the availability of tax credits in states that did not set up their own health insurance exchanges. The portion of these remarks that has received so much attention lately omits a critical component of the context in which I was speaking. The point I believe I was making was about the possibility that the federal government, for whatever reason, might not create a federal exchange. If that were to occur, and only in that context, then the only way that states could guarantee that their citizens would receive tax credits would be to set up their own exchanges. Translation: This is my less-publicized but perhaps more legally problematic gaffe, in which I said states weren't supposed to receive subsidies if they didn't set up their own exchanges (as many states did not). The law also appears to be written this way (oops!), but if had to abide by that, the law might implode on to itself. Republicans have seized on all of this as a way to dismantle the law, and the Supreme Court is hearing this case. But it's not really what I meant. (Again, I'm not a politician.) I have a long-standing and well-documented belief that health care reform legislation in general, and the ACA in particular, must include mechanisms for residents in all states to obtain tax credits. Indeed, my microsimulation model for the ACA expressly modeled for the citizens of all states to be eligible for tax credits, whether served directly by a state exchange or by a federal exchange. Translation: Here's some evidence that I didn't mean that. I am not an elected official, nor am I a political advisor. I am an economist who ran a complex microsimulation model to help Democratic and Republican politicians and their advisors understand the impact that their policies would have on the health care system. The recent response to my comments at academic and other conferences exceeds both their relevance and my role in federal health care reform. Translation: You got the wrong guy. I'm the consultant, man. I behaved badly, and I will have to live with that, but my own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act. The ACA is a milestone accomplishment for our nation that already has provided millions of Americans with health insurance. Our country is embarking on an exciting second open enrollment period that will provide new opportunities for these individuals, and millions more, to choose the insurance plan that works best for them. While I will continue to reflect on the causes of my own insensitivity, I hope that our country can move past the distraction of my misguided comments and focus on the enormous opportunities this law provides. Translation: Please don't let my comments screw this whole thing up. Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform grilled Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist and former adviser on the Affordable Care Act, for controversial comments he made about the law. (Julie Percha and Rebecca Schatz/The Washington Post) Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Jonathan Gruber, an economist, apologized for his past comments about the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which caused controversy when they were found last month.

To make butter in a mason jar, it's really easy! All you need is some heavy cream and a mason jar. Here's how you do it: 1. First, fill up the mason jar with heavy cream but not all the way - just about halfway. This will give enough room for the cream to move around when you shake it. 2. Now, put the lid on tight. Make sure it's closed really well so nothing spills out when you start shaking it. 3. Start shaking the jar! Shake it up and down, side to side, and all around. It might take a little while, so be patient and have fun with it. 4. After shaking it for about 5-10 minutes, you'll notice the cream starts to get thicker. Keep shaking until you see a solid lump of butter forming inside the jar. The liquid left behind is buttermilk, which you can use for other recipes or just drink it. 5. When you see the butter, open the jar and carefully pour out the buttermilk. Now, you can use a spoon or your clean hands to gather the butter and press it together into a ball. 6. Finally, you can wash the butter under cold water to rinse off any remaining buttermilk. Then enjoy your homemade butter on bread or in your favorite recipes! I hope this helps you understand how to make butter in a mason jar!

In fact, they change on a daily basis. But never so dramatically has rank been uprooted since the explosion of social media. Social media sites, especially the power houses of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, have become backlink central for affecting organic search results. Social media’s influence on driving business via the web is expected to surpass search engine optimization (SEO) in 2013, according to eMarketer. Web marketers and PR professionals must pay attention to how social media affects search, and ultimately how it can change the rules of online visibility and (online) brand engagement. Prior to Facebook’s takeover of the online universe (800 million active users today), online visibility in natural search was a sum of several measurable components: SEO site compliance on site structure and meta tags/content, directory link submissions and qualified and relevant site/blog linking. In 2010 the game officially changed, with Google’s support of social media — author reputation, bookmarking, commenting, as well as a number of other social factors (Likes, tweets, retweets, shares, etc.) — as a major factor in how it ranks websites and blogs in its algorithm. Real-time search in Google meant that search was only as valuable as the latest blog post, social share and comment. Today, the line is blurring. And this causes some confusion for web marketers. Should they focus on optimizing and driving traffic to their social pages? To their website? Where does their online brand live? How do they communicate their brand value proposition, whether their personal or corporate brand? The good news is that technology has advanced so that web marketers can manage their content and sites through the use of simple and effective blogging tools. Further, those blog tool properties, such as WordPress, support integration of social plug-ins and necessary content for social sharing including video, effective product/service literature and tagged imagery. And so, marketers can use social and manage their web presence to support online brand consistency. So, how can you use social media to increase your SEO rank and ensure that the rank and ensuing traffic will convert to web business? First, you must create and understand a parallel social media optimization/search engine optimization strategy. All creators of content on your team (copy, social commenting, videos and imagery) need to be on one brand team. The approach must be holistic. A unified brand message must drive visibility across all content and all channels. To define a common strategy for execution across standard SEO practices as well as across social media content development and sharing, marketers must rethink keyword development. The questions become less about search visibility versus obvious competition and more introspective in terms of what the corporate and executive brand mean. Ask your team questions such as: What is our brand value proposition? What do we want our audience to say about us? How will we incent out audience? How will we be leaders? Why will people follow us? Answering these questions will help you to zone in on your top branded, broad-based and narrow-based keywords. 3. Create a Plan of Action Once these target keyword phrases have been developed, you will need an actionable task plan to follow and with which to measure effectiveness of your new blended social/SEO strategy. The strategy must contain: content types and frequency, such as a weekly webinar production and planned outreach per social channel and media (social) buys/ads with effective messaging and resulting goals. Determining success in social affects search visibility such that the quality of the author, relevancy of the topical content, number of followers, number of comments/retweets and number of shares of blog posts must be considered and followed for search visibility to pull from success in these metrics. 4. Don’t Forget SEO Basics When determining how you will rank in natural search for branded and business-driving keywords, first do the ABCs of SEO work in terms of on-site optimization wherever your online marketing plan calls for conversion. Once that has been completed, rein in your social and search teams to determine your custom strategy and measurable plan. Remember that, just like traditional SEO practices, social media optimization work must be consistent, authentic, managed daily and measured for success.","response":"This news article talks about how to use social media to help your website show up better on Google.

To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2296: 0/2296 = (2296*m - 110208)/2296 0 = m - (110208 / 2296) Next, we need to divide 110208 by 2296: 110208 ÷ 2296 ≈ 48 So, our equation becomes: 0 = m - 48 To solve for m, we simply need to add 48 to both sides of the equation: m = 0 + 48 m = 48 Thus, the solution to the math problem is m = 48."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Golden Miller's Cheltenham Gold Cup victories came in the following years: 1. 1932: Ridden by Ted Leader, Golden Miller's first Gold Cup win was marked by his incredible stamina and speed. At the age of six, he displayed great potential and gave an early indication of his future dominance in the racing world. 2. 1933: In his second appearance at the Gold Cup with Ted Leader again as his jockey, Golden Miller was unstoppable. He won with a remarkable performance, making him the third horse in history to claim back-to-back Cheltenham Gold Cup victories. 3. 1934: T.W. Hyde took over as Golden Miller's jockey for the 1934 Cheltenham Gold Cup. In this race, Golden Miller showed his incredible prowess by claiming his third consecutive Gold Cup win, setting a new record and ensuring his place in racing folklore. 4. 1935: With Gerry Wilson as his jockey, Golden Miller continued his winning streak at the Cheltenham Festival. His fourth consecutive Gold Cup win was a testament to his skill, determination, and sheer dominance in the steeplechase event. 5. 1936: Partnered with Evan Williams, Golden Miller secured his fifth and final Cheltenham Gold Cup victory.

Let's analyze these two factors step by step: 1. Gestational Period for a Human Baby: On average, a human pregnancy lasts for approximately 40 weeks, which is equivalent to about 280 days. 2. Growth Period for Wheat Seeds: The duration of wheat growth can vary depending on the type, planting time, and climate, but the average time for wheat seeds to bloom is generally around 50 to 60 days after planting. Now, comparing these two durations: - Human gestation: ~280 days - Wheat seed blooming: ~50-60 days From this comparison, it is clear that the gestational period of a woman is significantly longer than the time it takes for wheat seeds to bloom.

(2) Explain the significance of these new figures in the context of the ongoing Syrian conflict and humanitarian crisis. The Syrian conflict has led to one of the largest humanitarian crises in recent times, with millions of Syrian citizens displaced within their own country and abroad. Recent estimates released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) indicate that the displacement crisis has taken a drastic turn for the worse – with approximately 2.5 million people now displaced within Syria. This shocking new statistic doubles the previous figure used by aid agencies, painting an even bleaker picture of the ongoing situation and underscoring the need for immediate action. A Closer Look at Displacement: (1) Define displacement and discuss its impact on affected individuals and communities. (2) Present a brief history of the Syrian conflict, which has led to massive displacement. Displacement refers to the forced movement of individuals away from their homes due to conflict, violence, persecution, or human rights violations. Displaced persons often face significant challenges, including a lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare. The Syrian conflict, which began in 2011, has been characterized by widespread violence, political instability, and human rights abuses. These conditions have driven millions of Syrians from their homes in search of safety and security. Growing Humanitarian Crisis: (1) Elaborate on the current state of the humanitarian crisis in Syria. (2) Discuss the role of international aid agencies in addressing the crisis, and the challenges they face in providing support due to the scale of the displacement. The updated displacement figures from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent provide evidence of an ever-growing humanitarian crisis within the country. Resources are being stretched thin as aid agencies struggle to provide adequate assistance to millions of displaced people. Access to healthcare, education, and other basic services remain severely limited, compounding the suffering of those affected. While international aid organizations continue to provide critical support, their efforts have been hindered by a lack of funding, bureaucratic obstacles, and the sheer magnitude of the crisis. Possible Solutions and the Way Forward: (1) Present potential solutions for addressing the displacement crisis, such as international intervention, diplomacy and ceasefire agreements, and increased humanitarian assistance. (2) Discuss the importance of a comprehensive and collaborative approach between governments, organizations, and the global community. Addressing the displacement crisis in Syria requires concerted efforts from various stakeholders. International intervention may be necessary to bring an end to the ongoing violence and facilitate the creation of safe zones for civilians. Additionally, diplomatic efforts should be intensified to broker ceasefire agreements and promote dialogue between conflicting parties. Moreover, increased funding and collaboration between humanitarian aid organizations can help provide much-needed assistance to those displaced by the conflict. In conclusion, the alarming displacement figures released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent serve as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of the Syrian conflict on its population. As the crisis continues to unfold, it's crucial for the international community to act in solidarity and take decisive steps to alleviate the suffering of millions of displaced Syrians and find sustainable solutions to this harrowing humanitarian crisis."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on this summary: eight asian middle eastern countries to form biotechnology center in india","response":"Eight countries from Asia and the Middle East are coming together to create a special science building in India, where they will study living things and make new, helpful inventions."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Rate your anger.

As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \\"lakes\\" disappear completely during each dry season.

Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others. - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry. - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U = 8 , V = 27 and W = 14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example . - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (\\"Coryphaena hippurus\\"), which is known as \\"dorado\\" in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation. What is the relationship between 'ab doradus moving group' and 'dorado'? The answer to this question is:","response":"The relationship between the 'AB Doradus Moving Group' and 'Dorado' can be understood from various perspectives. Firstly, the AB Doradus Moving Group consists of stars that are moving through space together and share similar properties such as age, metallicity, and motion. The group's name, AB Doradus, is derived from the primary star in the group, which itself is part of a quadruple star system located in the constellation Dorado. Dorado is a constellation in the southern sky, named after the dolphinfish or occasionally represented as a swordfish. It is one of the 88 modern recognized constellations and is an important region of the sky as it contains the majority of the Large Magellanic Cloud and the South Ecliptic pole. The connection between the AB Doradus Moving Group and Dorado can be summarized as follows: 1. Location: The AB Doradus Moving Group, including its primary star AB Doradus, is located within the boundaries of the constellation Dorado. This means that when we observe the stars in the AB Doradus Moving Group from Earth, they appear within the projected area of the Dorado constellation in the night sky. 2. Astrophysical significance: Both the AB Doradus Moving Group and the Dorado constellation are significant for their unique astronomical features. The proximity of the AB Doradus Moving Group to the Earth makes it valuable for studying the properties of young stars and their formation process. On the other hand, Dorado is known for hosting a significant portion of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and an important source of knowledge about galaxy formation and evolution. 3. Shared research interest: The presence of the AB Doradus Moving Group within the Dorado constellation makes it an important subject of study for astronomers observing the region. The constellation's unique features, combined with the presence of a co-moving group of young stars, provides valuable insight into various aspects of astrophysics, such as star formation, stellar evolution, and our understanding of the broader cosmos."},{"question":"Instructions: Craft one correct answer to the question given in input.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What happened after the writer wrote about OpenAdvantage? Options: - He became a knowledge worker - He became a peddler - not enough information - The founders hired him A:","response":"The founders hired him"},{"question":"Q:What is the last name of the person who conducted the 2010 production of L'incoronazione? Answer the above question based on the context below: The first recording of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a live stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only recording of the opera that predates the revival of the piece that began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as \\"far from authentic\\", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.Nikolaus Harnoncourt's 1974 version, the first recording without cuts, used period instruments in an effort to achieve a more authentic sound, although Denis Arnold has criticised Harnoncourt's \\"over-ornamentation\\" of the score, particularly his use of oboe and trumpet flourishes. Arnold showed more enthusiasm for Alan Curtis's 1980 recording, live from La Fenice in Venice. Curtis uses a small band of strings, recorders and continuo, with a trumpets reserved for the final coronation scene. Subsequent recordings have tended to follow the path of authenticity, with versions from baroque specialists including Richard Hickox and the City of London Baroque Sinfonia (1988), René Jacobs and Concerto Vocale (1990), and John Eliot Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists. Sergio Vartolo's production of the opera at Pigna, Corsica, was recorded for Brilliant Classics in 2004. A feature of this recording is the casting of a soprano Nerone in acts I and III, and a tenor Nerone in act II, to allow for the differing vocal requirements of the role in these acts. Vartolo accepts that \\"a staged performance would almost certainly require a different approach\\".In more recent years, videotape and DVD versions have proliferated. The first was in 1979, a version directed... A:","response":"Based on the provided context, the last name of the person who conducted the 2010 production of L'incoronazione is not mentioned.

Which language is this?","response":"The language used in the given sentence is Finnish. Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language and it is one of the two official languages of Finland, the other being Swedish. It is also an official minority language in Sweden. It is spoken by about 5.5 million people, most of whom reside in Finland. The Finno-Ugric family of languages, which also includes Estonian and Hungarian, is quite different in structure and vocabulary from the Indo-European languages, with which it shares only a few loanwords. Finnish tends to use an agglutinative structure, which means it often conveys information through the addition of various suffixes to words rather than using separate prepositions or auxiliary verbs. It is also known for having a few distinctly Finnish features such as the so-called \\"consonant gradation\\". Translating the given sentence into English gives: \\"The idea here is to at least partially share the costs resulting from membership in the European Union.\\" Just like other languages, Finnish has regional variations or accents. There are two forms of written Finnish: the \\"standard\\" or \\"book\\" Finnish used in official documents, literature, and newspapers; and the spoken Finnish which is used in everyday conversation and often varies by region. Finnish also has a large number of loanwords from Swedish, due to centuries of Swedish rule over Finland. These loanwords are found in all aspects of life, particularly in government, education, and law. In more recent times, Finnish has also loaned words from English, mainly related to technology and popular culture. Moreover, the Finnish language has its unique charm for foreigners interested in learning it. Although it is considered a hard language to master due to its complex grammar rules and pronunciation, many find the language extraordinarily beautiful, often likening its rhythmic and vowel-rich sound to the singing of birds. This characteristic finds its best expression in the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, which is written in an ancient form of the language and has inspired numerous works of art, literature, and music. All in all, the Finnish language represents an integral part of the Finns' identity and culture that has shaped and recorded their history, thoughts and way of life for centuries. Despite the challenge it poses to learners, its uniqueness and richness make the endeavor worthwhile."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which happened earlier, Ireland introduced a new constitution or the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration?\\" is in \\"The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.

Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence. Whatever the case, tensions between pro and anti-Seleucid Jewish factions led to the 174–135 BCE Maccabean Revolt of Judas Maccabeus (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of Hanukkah).

Step 2: Isolate the variable (j) Our goal is to solve the equation for j, which means we need to isolate j on one side of the equation. Step 3: Move the constant term to the other side To do this, we can add 3388 to both sides of the equation, which will cancel out the -3388 on the right side. This gives us: 15822 + 3388 = 565*j Step 4: Simplify the equation Now we can simplify the left side of the equation by adding the numbers together: 19210 = 565*j Step 5: Solve for the variable (j) We now need to solve for j by dividing both sides of the equation by 565: 19210 / 565 = j Step 6: Perform the calculation Dividing 19210 by 565, we get: 34 = j So, the answer is j = 34."},{"question":"Translate from English to Spanish: KAMAX strives for long-term partnerships with customers and suppliers","response":"KAMAX se esfuerza por tener asociaciones a largo plazo con clientes y proveedores.

The steps to solve the equation are as follows: Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable b The equation is 6829 = 153 * b + 427 * b - 7671. To combine the terms with the variable b, add the coefficients of these terms: 153 * b + 427 * b = (153 + 427) * b = 580 * b Now the equation becomes: 6829 = 580 * b - 7671 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable b In order to isolate the term with the variable b, we will move the constant term to the other side of the equation. So, add 7671 on both sides of the equation: 6829 + 7671 = 580 * b - 7671 + 7671 The equation becomes: 14500 = 580 * b Step 3: Solve for b Now to solve for b, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of b, which is 580: 14500 ÷ 580 = (580 * b) ÷ 580 This simplifies to: 25 = b So, the solution for the given equation, 6829 = 153 * b + 427 * b - 7671, is b = 25."},{"question":"Portugal: The country continued to be governed by a Junta de Salvação Nacional until the Portuguese legislative election of 1976.

Understand the hypothesis: \\"The Wiccan mail was polite, unlike some of the other mail we got.\\" - The hypothesis provides a comparison between the Wiccan mail and other mail. It implies that the Wiccan mail was polite, and some of the other mail was not. 3. Identify the key information in both the premise and the hypothesis: (a) Wiccan mail described as polite in the premise. (b) Wiccan mail described as polite in the hypothesis. (c) Hypothesis adds that other mail was not polite (unlike the Wiccan mail). 4. Compare the key information: - We can confirm that (a) and (b) are consistent - both state that Wiccan mail was polite. - Although the premise doesn't provide information about the politeness of other mail, the hypothesis makes a comparison. This implies that there is an observed difference in politeness levels between the Wiccan mail and other mail. 5. Conclude based on the comparison: - We can conclude that the part of the hypothesis referring to the Wiccan mail being polite is true, based on the given premise. - However, we are unable to confirm if the comparison with other mail is true, since the premise doesn't provide enough information about the politeness of other mail.

The menu is a treasure trove of delicious, healthy, and organic options, making it incredibly difficult to narrow down my choices. Fortunately, the attentive server was more than happy to offer suggestions based on my preferences and dietary requirements; her enthusiasm and knowledge of the dishes were both impressive and infectious. My meal started with a delightful Quinoa Salad, which combined exciting flavors and textures that harmoniously mingled with each bite. The crisp freshness of the greens, the chewiness of the quinoa, and the zestiness of the lemon vinaigrette created an addicting dish that left my taste buds dancing. For my main course, I opted for the Grilled Salmon with seasonal vegetables and a side of creamy mashed potatoes. The salmon was cooked to absolute perfection – flawlessly flaky with a slightly crispy exterior. The accompanying vegetables were cooked just right, giving the dish a satisfying crunch. To top it off, the generous helping of mashed potatoes was creamy and buttery, a delightful contrast to the fresh flavors of the salmon and vegetables. The climax of my meal was, without a doubt, the heavenly Chocolate Mousse Cake for dessert. This divine concoction featured varying levels of chocolatey goodness – ranging from light and fluffy mousse to a rich and velvety ganache. The delicate sweetness of the dessert married well with a hint of bitterness, striking the perfect balance that left me craving for more.

In cities, dialects are less common than on the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment. Q: In what geographic part of Germany are dialects more common?","response":"In general, dialects are more commonly spoken in the southern part of Germany. This region has a higher prevalence of dialect usage due to various historical, cultural, and social factors. The diversity and persistence of dialects in southern Germany can be attributed to the region's fragmented history and the strong regional identities that have been preserved over time. During the Holy Roman Empire and later the German Confederation, Germany was a collection of separate states and territories, each with their own distinct customs, traditions, and languages. Southern Germany, in particular, was home to a number of these distinct states, including Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, and Swabia. With the passage of time, the inhabitants of these regions developed unique linguistic features in their speech, which have persisted despite the process of German unification in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Factors like geographic isolation and strong regional identities have led to the continued use of dialects in southern Germany. Furthermore, the rural nature and strong agricultural communities in southern Germany have contributed to the preservation and use of dialects. In rural areas, people tend to have a closer connection to their local communities and traditions, which makes them more likely to use and maintain regional dialects. Moreover, the influence of neighboring countries and languages has also played a role in shaping the dialect landscape of southern Germany. Regions bordering Austria, Switzerland, and France have often incorporated elements of these neighboring languages into their dialects, creating a rich and diverse linguistic environment. While the use of dialects is more common in the southern part of Germany, it is important to note that dialects can still be found throughout the entire country. However, their prevalence and usage tend to decrease in the North, in urban areas, and in more formal public environments, often replaced by the use of standard German or Hochdeutsch."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est mignon.\\" Explanation: This sentence is in French, which is a different language than English.

She wanted to go to Beijing to watch the 2008 Olympics. Only one month ago, Lamu still thought it would be difficult. In the past Tibet had no railroad . If Lamu took a bus, it would take her a long time to reach Beijing. And a plane ticket would cost lots of money. However, things changed for Lamu. She was able to buy a ticket to the world's highest railroad. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway had been completed! The 1,142-kilometer railroad runs on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau . Lamu could reach Beijing by train in 48 hours! About 550 kilometers of the railroad are constructed on the frozen earth . When the frozen earth warms in summer, it can move the track. But Chinese scientists have built a special structure to solve the problem. The Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been designed with the wild animals in the designers' minds. It also has special underpasses for animals like Tibetan antelopes to go through. \\"The new railroad greatly helps Tibet's tourism,\\"said Liu Yueqin, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . As more tourists take trains to Tibet, there are more money for Tibetans. With the money, more kids can go to school. The railroad also makes things less expensive in Tibet. Now one can buy a TV set for about 1,500 yuan. It used to be much higher than that price. When there was no railroad, it had been difficult to send things in and out of Tibet.

The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the \\"power grid\\" in North America, or just \\"the grid\\". In the United Kingdom, the network is known as the \\"National Grid\\". - The coulomb (unit symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. It is the charge (symbol: \\"Q\\" or \\"q\\") transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second: - Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted or , but more often simply as \\"V\\" or \\"U\\", for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the test charge between two points and is measured in units of \\"volts\\" (a joule per coulomb). - In physics, potential energy is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position relative to others, stresses within itself, electric charge, and other factors. Common types include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, which has the symbol \\"J\\". - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links. - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - An electric potential (also called the \\"electric field potential\\" or the \\"electrostatic potential\\") is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point electric charge would have if located at any point in space, and is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from the arbitrarily chosen reference point (usually infinity) to that point without any acceleration. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The joule, symbol J, is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N·m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (18181889). - An electric field is a vector field that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point. Electric fields converge and diverge at electric charges and can be induced by time-varying magnetic fields. The electric field combines with the magnetic field to form the electromagnetic field. - Electric potential energy, or electrostatic potential energy, is a potential energy (measured in joules) that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An \\"object\\" may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged \\"objects\\". - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (17451827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery. - Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second. - Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - Sidney is a city and county seat of Cheyenne County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 6,757 at the 2010 census. - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. - Pressure (symbol: \\"p\\" or \\"P\\") is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge pressure (also spelled \\"gage\\" pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure. - Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, power supplies, thermocouples, solar cells, or dynamos. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - The ohm (symbol: ) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm. Although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, the British Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861. The definition of the ohm was revised several times. Today the definition of the ohm is expressed from the quantum Hall effect. - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Capacitance is the ability of a body to store an electric charge. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: \\"self capacitance\\" and \\"mutual capacitance\\", that are usually both designated by the same term \\"capacitance\\". A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage, than one with low capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with resistors and inductors). - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities. - Virginia Smith Converter Station is a High - voltage direct current ( HVDC ) back - to - back station near Sidney , Nebraska at 41 ° 09 51 \`\` N 102 ° 59 15 '' W named for former Congresswoman Virginia Smith , a Nebraska Republican who represented Nebraska 's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991 . Virginia Smith Converter Station was built by Siemens and began service in 1988 . The station can transfer a maximum power of 200 megawatts ; the voltage used by the station is 55.5 kV . Timing differences in continental - sized nations make national power grids based solely on conventional alternating current impossible . However , power can be transferred over longer distances and between separate AC grids by conversion to direct current during transmission , and conversion to alternating current in phase with the local line frequency at the delivery point . By the early 21st century , high - power semiconductors began to make the more difficult DC - to - AC conversion technically and economically possible at the high power levels needed in power grids . The Virginia Smith Converter station is significant for being the first interchange between eastern and western United States electrical grids . - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Nebraska's 3rd congressional district seat encompasses the western three-fourths of the state; it is one of the largest non-at-large Congressional districts in the country, covering nearly , two time zones and 68.5 counties.

Hold your small dog to the same standards as a larger dog. Reward positive behavior. Encourage your dog to relax around larger dogs. Inform others how to interact with your dog. Get help from a licensed trainer. Article:","response":"Title: Treat Your Little Dog Like a Big Dog: Tips for a Happier Pooch Did you know that little dogs need the same love, care, and training as big dogs? Yes, that's right! No matter if your dog is tiny like a Chihuahua or big like a Golden Retriever, they all need the same things. Here are some tips to help your small dog be even happier and healthier: 1. Don't Pick Them Up Too Much We know that little dogs are super cute and easy to lift. But carrying them around too much is not good for them. Think about big dogs; we don't pick them up, so we shouldn't do it to our little ones all the time. When your little dog is on the ground, they can explore, play, and be more independent. This makes them grow up to be confident and happy dogs. 2. Set Rules and Expectations Just like big dogs, little dogs need to follow the rules too. Teach your small dog not to bark too much, not to jump on the furniture, or not to beg for food. If you let them do whatever they want, they may become bossy and have bad manners. So, be a good friend and teach them how to behave well. 3. Praise and Reward Good Actions When your dog does something good, like sitting down or coming when you call them, make sure you praise them and give them a treat. This helps them learn that doing good things makes you happy, and they will want to keep doing it! 4. Help Them Make Friends with Big Dogs Sometimes little dogs can be scared of big dogs because they are much bigger than them. That's okay, but you can help your dog feel more comfortable around big friends. Let your little dog play with other dogs when you go to the park, and show them that there's no need to be afraid. Big dogs can be gentle friends too! 5. Teach People How to Treat Your Dog Your friends and family may not always know how to treat your little dog. Explain to them that they shouldn't carry your dog around, and that your dog needs to follow rules just like any other dog. This will help your dog become more respected and confident in the world. 6. Ask a Professional Trainer for Help If you need some extra help teaching your small dog good manners and behavior, you can ask a professional dog trainer. They have lots of experience working with all kinds of dogs - even small ones like yours! They can give you tips and tricks to make training your dog fun and easy. In the end, it's important to remember that little dogs and big dogs are more alike than you might think. Treat your small dog like you would a big dog, and they will grow up to be happy, well-mannered, and confident members of the family."},{"question":"Article:The 54-year-old man became ill at a property in Sackville Road, Dartford, at about 11:50 GMT on Saturday, Kent Police said.

Therefore, instead of presenting a simple statement, I am going to elaborate on the concept of brief sentences, their structure, and functions within communication. A brief sentence, also known as a short sentence or simple sentence, is a type of sentence that typically features a subject and a single verb, which effectively conveys a singular thought. These types of sentences support efficient and clear communication, facilitating an immediate understanding of the intended message. The construction of a brief sentence involves using essential components, including: 1. Subject: The person, place, thing, or idea responsible for the action within the sentence. 2. Verb: The action or state portrayed by the subject in the sentence. 3. Object (optional): The recipient or end-result of the action performed by the subject. In some instances, brief sentences may also contain additional elements, such as adjectives, adverbs, or additional descriptors. However, these should be used sparingly to maintain the concise nature of the sentence. For example, the following sentences illustrate the concept of a brief sentence: - \\"She cooks.\\" - \\"Dogs bark.\\" - \\"I work.\\" When used in written or spoken communication, brief sentences effectively communicate the core idea in a straight-to-the-point manner.

Carrie was happy to clear their elderly neighbour's driveway but Angela was not because","response":"of a past incident. Angela had lived in the neighbourhood for the past 10 years after her family moved here from a different city. Carrie, on the other hand, had bought her house just a few months back. They lived next door to each other, and despite Angela's apprehensions of clearing the elderly neighbour's driveway, they'd become inseparable. As they stood at the edge of old Mrs. Thompson's driveway, trying to ignore the biting cold wind, Angela remembered the incident from six years ago. Mrs. Thompson's late husband, Mr. Thompson, was known to be a bit of a recluse, with rumours circulating about his ill-temper and mysterious past. During one harsh winter, Angela, then a teenager, took it upon herself to help the elderly couple by clearing their driveway. As she worked, Mr. Thompson stormed out of the house, unleashing an unexpected tirade against her. He accused Angela of trying to snoop around and invade their privacy. No matter how Angela tried to convince him that she was only trying to help, Mr. Thompson refused to believe her. Ever since then, Angela avoided engaging with the Thompsons. She couldn't muster enough courage to look past the harsh memory. When Mr. Thompson passed away two years ago, Angela felt somewhat relieved, but the fear of betraying their privacy never left her. Carrie, however, knew nothing of Angela's past with the Thompsons. Over a hot cup of cocoa a few days back, Mrs. Thompson had mentioned her struggle to keep up with the winter chores, especially clearing the snow. Mrs. Thompson had aged considerably in recent years, and her frailty and loneliness touched Carrie. Thus, she saw the snowfall as an opportunity to help the elderly lady. \\"Come on, Angela, it's no big deal!\\" Carrie nudged her friend, picking up the shovel and starting to dig into the first pile of snow. \\"Besides, it's just Mrs. Thompson, and she seems pretty sweet.\\" Angela sighed, \\"I know, Carrie, but I just can't shake this feeling of guilt. There's a history there.\\" Carrie paused, looking at Angela with a concerned expression. \\"You've never told me about this. What happened?\\" As Angela recounted the story, Carrie listened carefully. She could see the pain in Angela's eyes. Once her friend had finished, Carrie took a deep breath and said, \\"You were just trying to be kind, Angela. And look, I'll be with you this time. We can do this together.\\" Angela hesitated for a moment before agreeing. She whispered a soft \\"thank you\\" to her friend and picked up another shovel. The snow fell gently around them as they worked, the two friends cautiously clearing the driveway while keeping an eye on Mrs. Thompson's house. At some point, as they progressed and their shovels tirelessly cleared the way, the front door creaked open. Mrs. Thompson appeared, her eyes widened as she noticed her neighbours working in her driveway. She stepped out carefully, clutching her shawl tightly around her. Carrie and Angela tensed up, not knowing what to expect. \\"Girls,\\" Mrs. Thompson called, her voice wavering, \\"thank you for doing this.\\" Surprisingly, her expression wasn't one of confusion or anger, but genuine gratitude. Angela looked up, her eyes filling with tears; she was finally free from her self-inflicted burden. In that moment, she knew she had misjudged the Thompsons a long time ago. Perhaps there was a lot more to them than she'd ever given them the chance to show. Carrie caught Angela's gaze and saw the unspoken relief in her friend's eyes as they continued to clear the driveway. Winter bitterness had brought them together and, in that fleeting moment, the cold felt just a little warmer."},{"question":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Wes. for the following movie plot: Sean (Graham Kosakoski), Ritch (Brody Harms), Wes (Tyler Hoechlin), and Lauren (Kate Todd) celebrate their college graduation by breaking into Saranoc Grotto, a forest heavily marked with \\"No Trespassing\\" signs and surrounded by a tall fence.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured.

Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement.

In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992.

As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that \\"Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility\\". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, Áed became Hugh, etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more...

He is considered one of the most influential and innovative authors in the Latin American literary scene. Cortázar's work often explores fantastical and surreal themes, blurring the lines between reality and imagination. Some of his most famous works include the short story collection \\"Bestiary\\" (1951) and the novel \\"Hopscotch\\" (1963), which is notable for its unorthodox narrative structure, allowing the reader to jump between chapters in a non-linear fashion. Norman Lindsay (1879-1969) was an Australian writer, along with being an artist and illustrator. He gained recognition in various creative fields, including drawing, etching, painting, and sculpture. As a writer, he is best known for his novel \\"The Magic Pudding\\" (1918), a witty and imaginative children's book that remains popular in Australia. Lindsay also authored several other novels, essays, and plays, often featuring controversial themes for his time. Satirical and critical of society, his works frequently sparked debates and even led to some of them being banned or censored. In summary, both Julio Cortázar and Norman Lindsay are writers, although they hail from different geographical and cultural backgrounds and focus on varied themes, writing styles, and topics in their works."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

Choices: - rain forest - tropical areas - pet store - library - story book The rationale to choose \\"story book\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","response":"\\"story book\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"story book\\" as the answer to the question of where a child can learn about the adventures of a talking monkey lies in understanding the nature and context of each choice provided. - Rain Forest: While rain forests are inhabited by various species of monkeys and primates, the likelihood of encountering a talking monkey in reality or learning about their adventures in such an environment is slim to none. The rainforest is a natural habitat for animals, not a place where kids go to learn about the adventures of fantastical creatures or characters. - Tropical Areas: Similar to the rain forest, tropical areas around the world may be where monkeys live, but this does not serve as an educational or learning environment for children to discover the adventures of a talking monkey. - Pet Store: Pet stores typically sell small animals, reptiles, and fishes. Monkeys, especially talking ones, are not common pets and are not usually found in pet stores. Even if the pet store would have a monkey, it would not be a talking one, and the child would not be able to learn about their adventures there. - Library: A library is a place where children can find various resources, including books, to learn about a wide array of subjects and explore the world of literature and storytelling. Here, a child is more likely to have access to storybooks that narrate the adventures of a talking monkey. Libraries are known as repositories of knowledge and adventure, making it an ideal place where a child can learn about the adventures of a talking monkey. - Story Book: A storybook is a book containing a collection of stories, often designed for children, and may feature illustrations, narratives, and different themes. It is in a storybook where a child can learn about the adventures of a talking monkey through imaginative storytelling and engaging visuals. Storybooks have the unique ability to transport children to different worlds, introduce them to new characters, and share exciting stories that evoke emotions and stimulate creativity. Considering the options presented, a \\"story book\\" is the most suitable and rational choice since it directly addresses the requirement of learning about the adventures of a talking monkey, whereas the other choices are not geared towards providing an educational or fictional experience that revolves around a talking monkey's adventures."},{"question":"\\"The impact of her interest and work on the provision of legal services in the state of California is immeasurable,\\" said Patricia Philips, senior of-counsel for Los Angeles' Morrison & Foerster. \\"Its value is felt every day by someone who would otherwise be floundering around in the legal system yet dealing with very serious problems.\\" Zelon's public-interest work has not gone unnoticed.

A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers.

In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. Shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns. \\"Bullet hell\\" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a .

Boasting an all-star cast including Donald Glover, Beyoncé, and James Earl Jones, the movie retains its classic charm while incorporating new elements to make it fresh for a modern audience. Step 2: Summary of the plot (without spoilers) The plot closely follows the original animated movie, as we return to Pride Rock and the story of young Simba. Simba, the son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, learns important life lessons and discovers his destiny to become king. After the tragic death of his father, Simba is manipulated into exile by his villainous uncle Scar. Along the way, Simba meets animated and offbeat characters that help shape his journey back to reclaim his rightful place as king of the Pride Lands. Step 3: Analyze characters and performances Donald Glover, as adult Simba, delivers a powerful yet vulnerable performance, expertly showcasing the complex emotions Simba goes through during his journey. Beyoncé offers a fierce, empowering portrayal of adult Nala, Simba's childhood friend and love interest. James Earl Jones reprises his role as King Mufasa, capturing his wisdom and love for his family. Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as Scar brings a darker, more cunning interpretation to the villain, while Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen serve as entertaining comic-relief as the lovable duo Timon and Pumbaa. Step 4: Examine the visual and technical aspects The film's ground-breaking photorealistic animation is nothing short of astonishing, allowing for an immersive experience that transports audiences to the heart of the African savanna. Wildlife and landscapes are stunningly detailed, and the character animations appear incredibly lifelike. The music, both classic favorites like \\"Circle of Life\\" and new contributions such as Beyoncé's \\"Spirit,\\" complements the story flawlessly, eliciting nostalgia and excitement throughout the film. Step 5: Evaluate the movie’s strengths and weaknesses One of the main strengths of the film is its faithfulness to the original story while updating character dynamics and introducing new elements, making it fresh and engaging for both new and returning fans. Additionally, the animation and sound design contribute to creating a beautiful and immersive experience. However, the film is not without its weaknesses. Some argue that the photorealistic animation, though impressive, can limit the characters' emotive expressions, somewhat reducing the emotional impact certain scenes may have had in the original film. Step 6: Give a final verdict In conclusion, Disney's live-action remake of The Lion King is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful journey, honoring the essence of the beloved classic. With superb vocal performances, nostalgic music, and groundbreaking animation, it's a film that will surely delight audiences of all ages. While some may miss the expressiveness of the original animation, the overall experience is still impressive and highly enjoyable."},{"question":"Write the answer: Which author wrote the Hunger Games series of novels?","response":"The Hunger Games series of novels was written by the talented American author Suzanne Collins. Born on August 10, 1962, in Hartford, Connecticut, Collins is known for her exceptional gift in storytelling and her ability to connect with readers from different age groups. Before the success of The Hunger Games series, Suzanne Collins worked on children's television programs as a writer, including significant projects such as Nickelodeon's \\"Clarissa Explains It All\\" and \\"The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.\\" Additionally, Collins earned a remarkable reputation as a children's book author when she published The Underland Chronicles, a fantastical five-book series. The Hunger Games trilogy, however, propelled her career to an international level. The series consists of three novels – \\"The Hunger Games\\" (2008), \\"Catching Fire\\" (2009), and \\"Mockingjay\\" (2010). Set in the dystopian world of Panem, the story revolves around the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, who volunteers to participate in the deadly Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. The games are a brutal, annual event imposed by the Capitol, Panem's totalitarian government, requiring each district to send two youths as tributes to compete in a televised battle to the death. As the story unfolds, Katniss shifts from a survivor to a symbol of rebellion against the oppressive Capitol regime and its manipulative leader, President Snow. The Hunger Games series is praised for its thought-provoking themes, including political control, inequality, social stratification, and the influence of media. Moreover, Collins' vivid descriptions and captivating storytelling keep readers engaged from the beginning to the end. Besides its underlying criticisms of societal inequalities, the series has also been commended for its female protagonist, who embodies resilience, resourcefulness, and leadership. Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games series has immensely impacted the young adult literature genre and been translated into numerous languages. The novels have also been adapted into successful films, further amplifying their influence and popularity. Through this series and her other works, Suzanne Collins has secured her place as a prolific and extraordinary author in contemporary literature."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect. Which friend studied more about short wavelength solar energy?

It is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture. Missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it, when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California. Tlingit has a complex system of pronominals, which vary depending on their relationship to the verb. The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot. The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb \\"complex\\"), but most are graphically independent. They are divided into three classes, the verbal object, nominal object, and postpositional object. There are also the independent pronominals which are completely separate from the verb and can be used in dependent clauses or in subject or object position. The pronominals all have related semantic values, and their organization can hence easily be visualized in a table. The numbers in the first column represent the usual concept of person, i.e. first, second, or third. Story and Naish identified a fourth person, but this term is inappropriate since they did not describe a clear separation between the so-called fourth person and the other impersonal pronominals. When analyzing a sentence, the pronominal type is given first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1SINGULAR SUBJECT is the first person singular subject pronominal, realized as xhat. The RECIPROCAL does not uniquely identify one of the two reciprocal pronominals, but since they are both phonetically identical as woosh, it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them. There is also a notional zeroth person which can be of subject, object, or independent form. This is not realized in Tlingit, instead it is an empty placeholder for analysis.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is the 1st class?","response":"In the Tlingit language, the first class of pronominals is associated with the verb and its relationship to the subject and object. As mentioned in the given text, \\"The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot.\\" This class deals with how the subject pronouns are integrated into the verb and how their meaning and usage can be affected by their position within the verb structure. Furthermore, the text states that \\"The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb \\"complex\\"), but most are graphically independent.\\" This indicates that the first class of pronominals in Tlingit also includes the object pronouns and their integration into the verb, although they maintain a level of independence from the verb itself."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest?","response":"Title: Yardage Battles: Comparing the Longest and Shortest Touchdown Runs in History Introduction Throughout the storied history of professional football, we have seen countless thrilling and memorable touchdown runs. From overpowered running backs bulldozing defenders to fleet-footed wide receivers displaying their agility, these exciting plays never cease to amaze. In this article, we will explore the fascinating disparity between the longest and shortest touchdown runs in professional football history, sighting notable examples and analyzing just how many yards separated these two extremes. The Longest Touchdown Run The longest touchdown run in NFL history clocked in at an impressive 99 yards. This extraordinary feat was first achieved in 1983 by Tony Dorsett, a Pro Football Hall of Fame running back who played for the Dallas Cowboys at the time. During a game against the Minnesota Vikings, Dorsett found an opening and sprinted the entire length of the field before crossing into the end zone. Remarkably, this incredible play occurred when the Cowboys were lined up on their own 1-yard line. Incredibly, Dorsett's record still stands to this day and has only been equaled once since then. In 2011, Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson matched Dorsett's record with his own 99-yard touchdown run against the New York Jets. The Shortest Touchdown Run On the opposite end of the spectrum, the shortest possible touchdown run in professional football measures a mere 1 yard. These diminutive plays often occur in goal-line situations or \\"dive\\" runs, wherein the running back barely crosses the threshold into the end zone. Examples of 1-yard touchdowns are plentiful, with numerous instances recorded throughout the years. However, a more intriguing variation of the shortest touchdown run occurs when a player manages to score from a distance of 0 yards. Naturally, this may cause some confusion: How can a player run for a touchdown without gaining a single yard? The answer lies in fumble recoveries. In certain situations, when an offensive player fumbles the ball within their own end zone and a teammate recovers it, the resulting play counts as a 0-yard touchdown run. One such example occurred in 2017, when Chicago Bears running back Benny Cunningham recovered a fumble in the end zone against the Green Bay Packers, scoring without advancing the ball a single inch. The Difference in Yards Now that we have established the parameters of the longest and shortest touchdown runs, we can finally answer the question posed at the outset of this article: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest? In the case of Tony Dorsett's and Chris Johnson's incredible 99-yard touchdown runs, the difference between their record-breaking plays and a 1-yard goal-line touchdown is a staggering 98 yards. When comparing to a 0-yard touchdown run resulting from a fumble recovery, the difference becomes even more impressive, with the longest touchdown run spanning a full 99 yards more than the shortest possible scoring play. Conclusion From Tony Dorsett's jaw-dropping sprint to Benny Cunningham's opportune fumble recovery, the longest and shortest touchdown runs in football history demonstrate the diverse range of ways in which players can find their way into the end zone. The 98- or 99-yard disparity between the two extremes serves as a testament to the unpredictable and thrilling nature of the sport. Whichever kind of touchdown you prefer, one thing is for certain – each hold its unique place in the annals of professional football history."},{"question":"Deborah Anne \\"Debby\\" Boone (born September 22, 1956), is an American singer, author, and actress. She is best known for her 1977 hit, \\"You Light Up My Life\\", which spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year. Boone later focused her music career on country music resulting in the 1980 No. 1 country hit \\"Are You on the Road to Lovin' Me Again\\". In the 1980s, she recorded Christian music which garnered her four top 10 Contemporary Christian albums as well as two more Grammys. With her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer Mike Curb to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, \\"You Light Up My Life\\" (which had been featured in the film of the same name) in 1977. The song became the biggest hit of the 1970s spending ten consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 -- longer than any other song in Hot 100 history to that point. (In 2008, Billboard ranked the song No. 7 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.) The song earned Boone a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop Single of 1977. She also received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female and Record of the Year won by, respectively, Barbra Streisand (\\"Love Theme From \\"A Star Is Born\\" (Evergreen)\\") and the Eagles (\\"Hotel California\\"). \\"You Light Up My Life\\" also succeeded on Billboard's Adult Contemporary (No. 1 for one week) and Country (No. 4) singles charts. The single and the album (No. 6 Pop, No. 6 Country) of the same name were both certified platinum. The song, written and produced by Joe Brooks, was from the film of the same name. Brooks earned Song of the Year awards at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song. (Boone performed the song at both awards shows.) Boone's version was not used in the movie or featured on its soundtrack. The song was lip-synched in the film by its star, Didi Conn, performing to vocals recorded by Kacey Cisyk. It was written as a love song, but Boone interpreted the song as inspirational and stated that she recorded the song for God. Boone's overnight success led to a tour with her father and frequent television appearances, but she was unable to maintain her success in pop music after \\"You Light Up My Life\\". Her follow-up single, \\"California\\" (also written and produced by Joe Brooks), peaked at No. 50 Pop and No. 20 AC. \\"California\\" was included on Boone's second album, Midstream, which faltered at No. 147 Pop. Her next single, the double-sided \\"God Knows\\"/\\"Baby I'm Yours\\", also struggled, peaking at No. 74 Pop, becoming her last entry on the Hot 100. However, the single charted AC (No. 14) and returned Boone to the country chart (No. 22). Boone then released another movie theme, \\"When You're Loved\\", from The Magic of Lassie. Like \\"You Light Up My Life\\", the song was nominated for an Academy Award for its composers, the Sherman Brothers, but it failed to replicate the success of her first single charting only No. 48 AC. Boone's wholesome persona contrasted with the image-conscious pop-music industry, leading her career in different musical directions. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did it receive any other awards?","response":"Yes, \\"You Light Up My Life\\" earned Debby Boone a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop Single of 1977. The song's writer and producer, Joe Brooks, also won Song of the Year awards at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song."},{"question":"From the following options, what is the question \\"Where can I find scientific data , \`\` research papers , '' on textile engineering ?\\" asking about? 1). description; 2). entity; 3). abbreviation; 4). human; 5). numeric; 6). location;","response":"The question \\"Where can I find scientific data, \`\`research papers, '' on textile engineering?\\" is asking about option 6). location, because it is asking for a place or source to find research papers on textile engineering."},{"question":"Given the question: What type of details about bunny brief can be gathered from the following bio?

In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \\"fucking sick of the whole thing\\", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \\"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\\"Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage.

He decides to collect water from a nearby stream and boil it to make it safe for drinking. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will boiling the water increase or decrease entropy? The answer is:","response":"Boiling the water will increase entropy. Entropy is a measure of the level of disorder or randomness in a thermodynamic system. When water is heated and reaches its boiling point, the water molecules gain more energy and start to move faster. This increased movement causes the molecules to spread out and form water vapor, transitioning from a more ordered liquid state to a less ordered gaseous state. The transformation from liquid to gas increases the overall disorder of the system, thus increasing entropy."},{"question":"Please answer this question: Which ‘A’ is another name for an enemy or opponent?","response":"Step 1: Understand the question.

Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and was actually known as \\"Crescendo\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls.\\" After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up.

In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children's ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written \\"I'll be home for Christmas.\\" The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy's chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane.

Answer:","response":"As the credits begin to roll for \\"Black Christmas,\\" the audience has already been taken on a thrilling ride of suspense and horror. The film's tense atmosphere has been built up throughout the movie, thanks to its eerie setting, sinister characters, and terrifying plot. Here is a brief summary of what happens as the credits roll, but remember that you should watch the entire movie to fully understand the events and their significance. First, let's recap the events leading up to the conclusion of the movie. Billy Lenz, a deranged mental institution patient, has escaped his cell after brutally murdering a security guard and stealing the costume of a volunteer dressed as Santa, all while planning to go back to his childhood home, now the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house. At the same time, we see the sorority house bustling with Christmas Eve activity and the unsuspecting inhabitants unaware of the horror that awaits them. As the credits roll, we can expect several things to unfold in the story. For starters, Billy Lenz will likely make his way towards the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house to enact his twisted plan of terror. In doing so, he will undoubtedly bring chaos, fear, and bloodshed to what would otherwise be a peaceful and idyllic holiday night. The various characters that have been introduced so far, such as Kelli Presley and her boyfriend Kyle Autry, will likely find themselves having to confront the sinister murderer in their midst. Each character will be tested in terms of their grit, resourcefulness, and ability to survive under dire circumstances. Throughout their ordeal, we can expect to see acts of bravery, intelligence, and possibly even self-sacrifice. As the movie plot progresses toward its climax, it's likely that additional twists and surprises await the audience. We might witness unexpected betrayals, chilling revelations about the characters, or even the involvement of other parties with connections to Billy Lenz's murderous past. Finally, the conclusion of the movie will resolve the conflict between the sorority members and the murderer. Whether this resolution involves the defeat or capture of Billy Lenz, or the heartbreaking loss of one or more characters, is something that can only be revealed by watching the film itself. In summary, as the credits roll for \\"Black Christmas,\\" the stage is set for an intense and chilling confrontation between the killer Billy Lenz and the unsuspecting residents of the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house. The movie promises to be a rollercoaster ride of emotions, as the characters fight for their survival amidst a whirlwind of horror, thrills, and unexpected twists. For those interested in investing in this film proposal, it's essential to consider if the movie's genre, storyline, and mix of suspense and surprise can generate a positive response from the target audience. Elements such as the movie's production values, marketing strategy, and the appeal of the cast and crew would also play critical roles in determining the film's potential success."},{"question":"The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Skeletal muscles and heart muscles are alike because _ . A) both can move voluntarily B) both are thick muscles C) both are bigger than smooth muscles D) both have stripes called striations The answer to this question is:","response":"D) both have stripes called striations"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two men are working in the park.

Answer:","response":"To accurately answer this elaborate question about Canterbury College's affiliations and the approximate number of undergraduate students in the affiliated college, we first need to gather relevant information about Canterbury College and its associated institutions. According to the information available online, there are multiple establishments using the name \\"Canterbury College\\". The first step is to identify which Canterbury College is being referred to in the question. Based on the context, we can narrow it down to Canterbury College in the United Kingdom and the one in New Zealand. 1. Canterbury College in the United Kingdom: This Canterbury College is a further and higher education institution located in Canterbury, Kent, England. After researching various sources, there does not appear to be any notable affiliation between Canterbury College in the UK and another college or university where undergraduate students are specifically counted. 2. Canterbury College in New Zealand: The second institution is the Canterbury College in Christchurch, New Zealand, which is mainly a high school and not an undergraduate college or university. Typically, high schools do not have affiliations with undergraduate colleges or universities in a manner that would uniquely influence the number of undergraduate students at the affiliated institution. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately provide the approximate number of undergraduate students at a college affiliated with Canterbury College, as the question does not specify which Canterbury College is in question, and neither appears to have a notable affiliation with an undergraduate institution.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. Question: \\"Who took action outside of her training?\\" Answer: \\"Ong\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","response":"Yes, the answer is correct. Betty Ong, a flight attendant on the hijacked plane, took action outside of her training by contacting the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, to report an emergency aboard the flight.

In the woods lives an old woman. Options: -- unacceptable; -- acceptable;","response":"A linguist would most likely find the following sentence to be acceptable grammatically: \\"In the woods lives an old woman.\\" This sentence is an example of a less conventional, yet still grammatically correct, word order in English. The typical canonical word order in English is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). However, the sentence above uses a structure known as \\"inversion,\\" where the subject and the verb are inverted – the sentence essentially starts with a prepositional phrase (i.e., \\"In the woods\\"), followed by the verb (i.e., \\"lives\\"), and then introduces the subject (i.e., \\"an old woman\\"). Such inversions can be used in English for a range of reasons, which include emphasis or style. In this case, the inversion allows for added emphasis on the location (\\"in the woods\\"), creating an engaging setup with a sense of mystery for the listener or reader. While inversions might not be the standard way of constructing sentences in English, they are still considered grammatically acceptable in certain contexts, and are often used in literature or other forms of creative writing to create interest, dramatic effect, or emphasize specific elements within the sentence. As such, the sentence in question not only adheres to the rules of English grammar but also demonstrates the flexibility and richness of the language, and a linguist would recognize this variation as acceptable."},{"question":"CHAPTER XV THE CASTAWAYS OF THE GULF \\"It vos der earthkvake!\\" yelled Hans, as he scrambled to his feet. \\"Der oceans vos all busted up alretty!

Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

He had two older brothers, William and Isidor. He spent part of his youth in Mount Vernon, New York. Context: He moved into television with scripts for Danger, The Gulf Playhouse and Manhunt. Philco Television Playhouse producer Fred Coe saw the Danger and Manhunt episodes and enlisted Chayefsky to adapt the story It Happened on the Brooklyn Subway about a photographer on a New York subway train who reunites a concentration camp survivor with his long-lost wife. Chayefsky's first script to be telecast was a 1949 adaptation of Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? for Philco. Since he had always wanted to use a synagogue as backdrop, he wrote Holiday Song, telecast in 1952 and also in 1954. He submitted more work to Philco, including Printer's Measure, The Bachelor Party (1953) and The Big Deal (1953). One of these teleplays, Mother (April 4, 1954), received a new production October 24, 1994 on Great Performances with Anne Bancroft in the title role. Curiously, original teleplays from the 1950s are almost never revived for new TV productions, so the 1994 production of Mother was a conspicuous rarity. In 1953, Chayefsky wrote Marty, which was premiered on The Philco Television Playhouse, with Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand. Marty is about a decent, hard-working Bronx butcher, pining for the company of a woman in his life but despairing of ever finding true love in a relationship. Fate pairs him with a plain, shy schoolteacher named Clara whom he rescues from the embarrassment of being abandoned by her blind date in a local dance hall. The production, the actors and Chayefsky's naturalistic dialogue received much critical acclaim and influenced subsequent live television dramas. Chayefsky had a unique clause in his Marty contract that stated that only he could write the screenplay, which he did for the 1955 movie. Chayefsky's The Great American Hoax was broadcast May 15, 1957 during the second season of The 20th Century Fox Hour. This was actually a rewrite of his earlier Fox film, As Young as You Feel (1951) with Monty Woolley and Marilyn Monroe. The Great American Hoax was shown on the FX channel after Fox restored some The 20th Century Fox Hour episodes and telecast them under the new title Fox Hour of Stars beginning in 2002. Question: Was any of his scripts written successful? Answer:","response":"Yes, several of Chayefsky's scripts were successful. His script for Marty, which premiered on The Philco Television Playhouse in 1953, received critical acclaim, and he went on to write the screenplay for the 1955 movie version of Marty. The success of Marty's television production and its naturalistic dialogue earned praise and influenced subsequent live television dramas. Additionally, other scripts such as Printer's Measure, The Bachelor Party (1953), and The Big Deal (1953) were submitted to Philco, demonstrating his continuous involvement in television at the time. His 1949 adaptation of Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? for Philco also marked an important milestone as his first script to be telecast."},{"question":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): Gorgo is a 1961 British-American science fiction monster film directed by Eugène Lourié.

Movie title: King Rat Movie plot: George Segal plays Corporal King, an American soldier in a Japanese prison camp who manages all the black market operations amongst the enforced holding of a group of English and Americans. His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system.

The eggs from Lindsey's farm taste better than the ones Amy produces.","response":"The eggs from Lindsey's farm taste better than the ones Amy produces, likely due to a number of factors contributing to the overall quality and freshness of the eggs. One possible reason is that Lindsey's hens could be receiving a more diverse and nutritious diet, resulting in eggs with richer flavors and more vibrant yolks. The chickens may be fed with a combination of high-quality grain mixtures, vegetables, and free-range access to insects and grasses in the surrounding environment. Step 1: Acknowledge the taste difference between Lindsey's and Amy's eggs Step 2: Consider possible reasons for the taste difference, such as the chickens' diet Another factor to consider in the taste difference is the living conditions of the hens on each farm. If Lindsey's chickens are given ample space to roam and exercise, this could result in less stress for the animals and, ultimately, tastier eggs. In contrast, if Amy's chickens are kept in confined or cramped conditions, the stress they experience may negatively impact the quality and taste of their eggs. Step 3: Examine living conditions as a factor for taste differences The freshness of the eggs might also play a role in the taste difference. If Lindsey regularly collects and sells her eggs soon after they are laid, this ensures that customers receive the freshest possible product. On the other hand, if Amy collects her eggs less frequently or they spend more time on store shelves before being purchased, this can lead to a decline in taste quality. Step 4: Assess the impact of egg freshness on taste differences Finally, it is important to consider each farm's approach to the use of hormones, antibiotics, and other treatments for their chickens. Lindsey's farm may be more conscious of ethical and sustainable practices, using fewer chemicals and prioritizing the overall health and well-being of the chickens. This attention to the chickens' care could directly translate to better-tasting eggs. Meanwhile, Amy's farm might use more conventional farming methods, which could have a less favorable impact on the taste of the eggs. Step 5: Evaluate the potential influence of farm practices on egg taste In conclusion, the taste difference between Lindsey's and Amy's eggs can be attributed to factors such as diet, living conditions, freshness, and farm practices. It is essential for both producers and consumers to be aware of these factors, as they have a direct influence on the taste and quality of the eggs they enjoy."},{"question":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Answer the above question based on the context below: One evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a naiad-like character (called a \\"Narf\\") from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\", a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf. Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To recover from her wounds and return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer. A:","response":"In order to return home, the woman from the Blue World, Story, needs the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. These individuals will play specific roles in ensuring her safe passage back to the Blue World, where she is destined to be a great leader. 1. The Symbolist: The Symbolist is responsible for deciphering the complex signs and messages from the Blue World. They must possess the knowledge and understanding to interpret these signs, which will ultimately guide Story's actions and decisions. In the context presented, it was initially thought that Dury was the Symbolist; however, this conclusion might be flawed due to Farber's misadvice. It is essential to identify the correct Symbolist for Story to receive proper guidance. 2. The Guardian: The Guardian's role is to protect Story from the dangers she might face during her journey, particularly from the Scrunt, who is intent on attacking her despite the Tartutic's protection. Cleveland Heep is believed to be Story's Guardian, and as such, he takes on the responsibility of keeping her safe from harm. His duty will involve risk assessments, strategizing, and occasionally engaging in combat to defend Story. 3. The Guild: Comprising a group of individuals, the Guild plays a crucial role in completing specific tasks and providing support for Story's return. They work in unison, offering their unique skills and expertise to aid in the fulfillment of her mission. Initially, the five nameless smokers were identified as the Guild, but this conclusion might also be incorrect due to Farber's misguidance. Identifying the true Guild members is necessary for the effective execution of tasks related to Story's safe return to the Blue World. 4. The Healer: Last but not least, the Healer is required to help Story recover from her wounds sustained during her encounters with the Scrunt. The Healer possesses the ability to promote physical, emotional, or spiritual healing and well-being. In the context provided, Bell was erroneously assumed to be the Healer as a result of Farber's poorly-guided advice. Discovering the true identity of the Healer is of utmost importance, as Story's wellbeing directly affects her chances of a successful return. To summarize, the woman from the Blue World, Story, needs the collective assistance of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer to return home safely. These individuals play pivotal roles in interpreting messages from her world, protecting her from harm, executing crucial tasks, and ensuring her recovery from wounds. The initial identification of these roles may have been misguided due to Farber's advice; therefore, it is vital to accurately determine the identities of these individuals for the successful completion of Story's mission and her return to the Blue World."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: dimensional map of the state individual islands labeled","response":"In the sentence, \\"dimensional map of the state individual islands labeled,\\" the most salient words are: 1. Dimensional - This word describes the nature of the map being discussed. A dimensional map emphasizes the representation of geographical attributes in a specific manner. It could be a two-dimensional (2D), a three-dimensional (3D), or any other kind of dimensional map with specific visualization properties. 2. Map - This word is the core element of the sentence, around which the meaning revolves. A map is a graphic representation of a defined space or area, usually depicted on a flat surface. Maps serve as essential tools for understanding geographical features, boundaries, and other aspects of the physical world. 3. State - This term indicates the geographical area being represented by the map. A state is a politically defined territory with its boundaries, and in this context, it means that the map aims to depict a specific state with its constituent parts, such as cities, towns, and other geographical features. 4. Individual - This adjective is used to describe the islands mentioned in the sentence. It implies that the islands are separate and distinct from one another, and that each island has been given specific attention in the map. This suggests that the map provides a detailed view of each island rather than presenting them as a collective, generalized whole. 5. Islands - This term refers to the specific geographical features being represented in the state. Islands are masses of land surrounded by water, which may vary in size and shape. The mention of islands implies that the state consists of multiple islands, each with its distinctive features that need to be represented in the map. 6. Labeled - This word describes the way the islands are depicted on the dimensional map of the state. A labeled map signifies that each island has been marked, named, or otherwise identified in some manner.

Four years ago, Thomas Manning received devastating news: He had cancer and needed to have his penis amputated. This, of course, took a toll on him both psychologically and physically. Manning, though, was undeterred and later became just the third person—and the first American—to receive a penis transplant. The pioneering surgery, performed at Massachusetts General Hospital in May, lasted for 15 hours and has since been heralded as a major medical breakthrough. Today, Manning, 64, is cancer-free and waiting for doctors to tell him it’s safe to pop a Viagra. Talking with him at his home in Halifax, one thing becomes remarkably clear: Manning is not shy about anything. What were the circumstances that led you to volunteer for this experimental surgery? Let’s start four years ago when I had an accident. I had slipped on some black ice while working. I was pushing a cart that carries moving boxes. It went up in the air, too, and landed on me—on top of my stomach—and pushed 30 percent of my colon down into my groin. While I was being treated at Mass General, doctors performed all of these tests on me. At first, they couldn’t find anything. But then one doctor was examining my groin and all of a sudden said, “You have cancer.” They biopsied a piece of my penis and confirmed I had cancer. They said the only treatment available was that the entire penis had to be removed. They were worried it was in my lymph nodes. More than a week later, the doctor amputated my penis. What were the psychological consequences and the physical challenges of having the amputation? It was a real kick in the chops. I actually thought I was going to die. Then I thought I was going to have tubes forever hanging off of me. I wondered how I was going to go to the bathroom. The doctor told me not to jump to conclusions. When I woke up from the surgery, my penis was gone and they had put in a catheter. I didn’t look at it for a few days—maybe three days. I didn’t have the courage to look at myself. Were there physical complications? One after another. One of my testicles blew up to the size of a basketball. All of this fluid had built up in it. So here I am with my penis chopped off and my testicles blown up. They had to operate again. I was thinking what everyone else probably would be thinking: What kind of guy am I going to be? Am I going to be disabled for the rest of my life? I confronted it. How was I supposed to feel? You’re never the same after something like this. How did you pee? They sent me home with a catheter and I became rather comfortable with it. I think it made it easier for me to learn to accept the position that I was in. Without the catheter, I just had a wound, and you couldn’t expose that wound. The only way to deal with it was with a catheter. Did you still think about sex? I didn’t think there was going to be any more of that. I just came to terms with it. I didn’t dwell on it. Were you resigned to living the rest of your life without a penis? Oh, yeah. I wasn’t getting anywhere with the doctors for a long time. Your whole life is upside down. I was dealing with it, but I kept thinking there were [other patients in the hospital] all around me who were much worse. So how did you end up consulting a medical team about a penis transplant? I didn’t sit around and wait. I wanted this and kept pushing my doctors to ask about it. They initially told me I wasn’t a candidate for it because I had a heart condition. So they put me on the inactive list. Right away, I called my doctors to get a cardiologist appointment so that I could limit the risk [from my] heart condition and be considered a better candidate for the transplant and surgery. What did your doctors tell you about the realities of having a transplant? Were there major risks? Yes. It was a 16-hour-long surgery, so they were concerned about my heart condition. The real tough part of this, though, was the medication that I would need to take to stop the body from rejecting the transplant. They told me it would knock years off my life because of the stress it puts on your body and kidneys. I was initially very concerned about that. Was there any talk about the size, girth, and skin tone of the donor’s penis? The only concerns were about skin tone and blood type. Those were the two things they look to match up. Everything else is hit or miss. How did they find a donor? I went on a list, the donor list. Were there challenges in finding a consenting donor? I had type B blood, and that’s pretty rare. I was pretty lucky that they found a donor. I was lucky because I was ready, they were ready, and we found a donor within our time frame. Everything just came together. Do you know anything about your donor? They didn’t give us much information at all. This person had died in Maine. Eight people received organs from this donor. The doctors were there [just before he died] and had a religious service. All of the family members were with the doctors and said prayers. He was kept on the machine while they said their prayers and then they [removed] the organs, and he was taken off the machine. ||||| The Interview: Thomas Manning, America’s First Penis Transplant Recipient He has a lot to say. You kept the fact that you were planning to undergo transplant surgery a secret from your family until just before the procedure. Why is that? I initially had told some people, but then the doctors canceled plans for the procedure. I didn’t want to tell my family again that I was going to do it, and again have it not happen. I wanted to wait, and for them to know that it was really happening. I had been telling them for four years how I wanted a transplant and I think many thought I was just blowing smoke. I just didn’t want it to be a false alarm. That would’ve been a huge disappointment for me. I knew this was going to be a big deal. What was your family’s reaction? Some of them didn’t find out until they saw me on TV talking about it. I don’t know how they all feel about it. Some of them came to the hospital. Were you concerned about being stigmatized, given that this is such a rare procedure and such a socially sensitive part of the anatomy? Any time you’re dealing with the penis, vagina, or breasts, it’s sex, sex, sex. Everything gets blown out of proportion and becomes “dirty.” When you’re dealing with this straight up and bluntly, it’s really just life itself. Life is dirty sometimes. I really wasn’t concerned with it too much. Walk me through the first time you looked at your new penis. What was going on in your head and what was your initial perception? It was tough. It was black and blue—and I mean black and blue. I was all cut up—I had stitches everywhere. I took one look at it three days after the surgery, and I was in shock. It knocked me down and I couldn’t believe it. I looked at it a couple of times and then I didn’t want to look at it anymore. I wanted it to heal and do what it’s supposed to do. If I were to keep looking at it and dwelling on it, it would’ve gotten to me and I didn’t want it to. So I gave it time, and when it was ready, it would be ready. I didn’t look again until a week later. Where are you in terms of recovery? Is there still a chance that your body could reject the transplant? It’s not like you’re dealing with a kidney or liver. You can see if it’s working or not. My doctors tell me your body can reject it at any point. But so far, so good. The doctors tell me I’m doing well. So is the team of surgeons closely monitoring you and documenting your progress? I won’t have full feeling there until March, but they think I’m ahead of schedule. I’m at the hospital frequently. Many people would shy away from talking about this. Why are you so candid, and what has the response been? I have a choice. I can be up front or I can hide. If I lie about it, then it turns into another lie after another lie. I’m just not in the mood to cover up something that I just don’t have to. If other people can’t deal with it, they can’t deal with it. I mean, it’s always going to be there, so what am I going to do? What was it like to go on national television to discuss your experience? I was on The Dr. Oz Show, and people still stop me and ask about it. You get so many different responses. The majority of people are pretty intrigued and don’t give me grief about it. I know people have jokes, but I won’t let anyone joke about the donor. I won’t tolerate that. That donor can’t fight for himself, so I have to stand here and be his surrogate and speak for him. Is there any type of physical therapy that you have to go through? No. The only physical therapy I had was initially getting out of the hospital, and whether I could walk up the stairs. There’s not a lot of physical therapy you can do for this, if you know what I mean. How does it work? What is a successful outcome in the eyes of your doctors, and what is a successful outcome in your eyes? The first milestone was, could I use the toilet? They didn’t think that would happen for a while, but they were very, very happy with the progress because it happened so fast. They say I’ll be able to do everything I’m supposed to do—go to the john, have a sex life, and regain full sensation. In my eyes, if I have to live without one of those things, then I learn to live without. I’ll learn to live with what I have. I expect to be in and out of the hospital for a long time. There are so many things involved here. Based on what you’re telling me, I assume you’re not able to masturbate or have sex with your new penis? Not yet, and I’ll tell you up front, I’m not even going to attempt to do that until March, maybe longer. Are you nervous about that? I’m not dwelling on it. You know, it’s important to me that I can do that. If [sex or masturbation] does happen, it would be a miracle, if you really think about it. I mean, when you think about what I had four years ago compared to what I have now—that’s a lot. It’s emotional for me. I get emotional about this. I sometimes want to be alone to think about how I really feel about this. I belong to a very exclusive club. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Thomas Manning, America's first penis transplant recipient, openly discusses his journey from amputation due to cancer to the successful 15-hour transplant surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The iconic ’90s failure known as Crystal Pepsi is set to hit supermarket shelves for four weeks starting July 11. A 20-ounce bottle will retail for 1.79 — so definitely not ’90s prices. When the doomed drink originally debuted in 1992, it was so tremendously unpopular it went off the market the next year. It resurfaced briefly last year as part of a sweepstakes in which the company gave away 13,000 six-packs of Crystal in less than two days, according to Advertising Age. Now, after testing the waters — or bubbles — the see-through soda is back again. \\"Pepsi is all about pop culture and few things are as hot right now in pop culture as the 1990s,\\" said Pepsi marketing director Linda Lagos. To coincide with its clear drink release, Pepsi is debuting a “Oregon Trail”-style video game called “The Crystal Pepsi Trail.” Littered with ’90s references including everything from Furby to Tamagotchi to pagers, the goal of the game is to “collect as many 90s items along the trail as you can with your dawgs,\\" according to a developmental version of the game. This isn’t the first dated drink to make a return to store shelves. In 2014, Coca-Cola relaunched Surge. More recently, Hi-C Ecto Coolers and Mtn Dew Pitch came back as well. Earlier this month, Pepsi also announced the controversial decision to resurrect its aspartame formula of Diet Pepsi. The move was not especially popular online. “Just found out you're putting aspartame back in diet Pepsi,” one woman wrote on the company’s Facebook page. The reactions to Crystal Pepsi were a little more mixed. “Crystal Pepsi sounds stupid until you realize you can use it to make a totally clear rum and cola,” IGN host Max Scoville wrote on Twitter. Some reactions were a little more tongue-in-cheek. “Crystal Pepsi is coming back which is great timing because I was just sitting here thinking of new ways to damage my pancreas,” wrote Twitter user Martin Munson. A lot of tweets were just openly negative. “As a former soda pitchman I’m as qualified to comment on beverages as Corey Lewandowski is to be on CNN.

Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman), and the younger Detective Felix Owens (Thomas Jane) question him. Hearst changes his story several times: he was jogging with a neighbour's dog, he found her, the dog found her, he was jogging without the dog, so the police think he has done it.Benezet is pressured by his boss (Miguel Ángel Suárez) to free Hearst so that he can give his speech. However, as there is no conclusive proof, Benezet has to let him go.At the party, a crowd is gossiping, and Chantal Hearst (Monica Bellucci), his wife, has to keep her composure. She will be questioned later, after her husband gives his speech without his wig, to confirm why she and her husband sleep in separate rooms.

Hearst says that Chantal and artist Paco Rodríguez (Luis Caballero) are lovers. He's the husband of Chantal's sister María (Jacqueline Duprey). Chantal says that he saw Hearst with her niece Camille (Isabel Algaze) giving her presents and trying to seduce her.

The question asks, \\"Where could there be more than one college?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking about possible locations where multiple colleges might be present. So, we need to look for answers that fit this criteria. Step 2: Analyzing the possible answers - Electrical circuit: This is not relevant to the question, as it involves electrical components and has nothing to do with the location of colleges. - Big town: A location where multiple colleges could possibly exist due to a larger population and more resources. - Big city: Similar to Big town, this is a location where multiple colleges could possibly exist due to larger populations and more available resources. - Building: Although there could technically be more than one college located within a single building, this is less likely and less common, compared to larger human settlements like big towns or big cities. - Fraternity house: This is a specific housing arrangement for college students and is not relevant to the question, as it does not indicate a location that necessarily hosts multiple colleges. Step 3: Justifying the answer \\"Big town\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it makes sense that larger towns would have more resources and a larger population. This would enable the establishment and operation of multiple colleges to cater to the educational needs of the people living there."},{"question":"The harder the batter hits the ball, the greater will be its acceleration. Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are harder or softer ): If Jim wants to increase the amount of acceleration applied to a baseball he must hit it harder or softer?","response":"Jim must hit the baseball harder in order to increase the amount of acceleration applied to it. This is because the force exerted on the baseball is directly related to the acceleration it experiences. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration can be found in Sir Isaac Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F = m * a). When Jim hits the baseball with a greater amount of force, the acceleration of the ball will also increase. This is because the ball's mass remains constant, and in order to maintain the equation, an increase in force will result in a corresponding increase in acceleration. Hitting a baseball harder involves utilizing more muscular strength, increasing swing speed, and making solid contact with the ball. As the bat comes into contact with the ball, the force of the collision is transferred from the bat to the ball, causing it to accelerate away from the point of contact. The harder the ball is hit, the greater the force exerted, and thus, the higher the acceleration experienced by the ball. In summary, if Jim wants to increase the amount of acceleration applied to a baseball, he must hit it harder. This will result in a more powerful impact and cause the ball to experience a greater change in velocity in a shorter amount of time, leading to increased acceleration."},{"question":"Q:Trees have woody stems covered with bark, and pines in general are popular trees.

Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Paragraph: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","response":"Organic semiconductors are a class of materials that exhibit electronic and optical properties similar to conventional inorganic semiconductors, but are primarily composed of organic (carbon-based) molecules or polymers instead of inorganic crystalline structures. They are attractive candidates for a wide range of applications, such as in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and various sensing and display technologies, due to their unique properties such as mechanical flexibility, solution-processability, and tunable optical and electronic properties. The concept of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) play critical roles in understanding the electronic properties of organic semiconductors. They are essential for characterizing the energy of the frontier orbitals of molecules that define charge distributions, band gaps, and electronic transitions. The HOMO level corresponds to the highest energy level filled with electrons, whereas the LUMO level is the lowest energy level above the HOMO that is unoccupied by electrons. The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels is also known as the bandgap, which determines the material's light absorption and emission properties, as well as its conductivity. The suggested answer alludes to the phenomena of low mobility and stabilization of unpaired electrons in charge-transfer complexes. While these factors may play a role in some organic semiconductors, this answer alone does not provide a comprehensive overview of what organic semiconductors are and the importance of HOMO and LUMO concepts. A more accurate and detailed response would include: 1. A definition of organic semiconductors as carbon-based materials with electronic and optical properties similar to inorganic semiconductors. 2. An explanation of the structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors, such as the influence of molecular orientation, intermolecular interactions, and crystal packing on charge transport and device performance. 3. A description of the HOMO and LUMO levels, as well as their significance in determining the bandgap, optical properties, and conductivity of organic semiconductors. 4. An elaboration of the mentioned phenomena of low mobility and stabilization of unpaired electrons, discussing the role of charge-transfer complexes and other factors that contribute to the unique electronic properties of organic semiconductors. In conclusion, the proposed answer does not adequately address the question and should not be validated. Instead, a response should be formulated that incorporates the key aspects of organic semiconductors and the HOMO-LUMO concept, as outlined above."},{"question":"Question: what is a good bank road?

Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location. Which brother studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters? A:","response":"The brother who studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters would be Dan. This is because the movement of rocks, especially on a massive scale that measures in centimeters or meters, is usually associated with seismic activity, or earthquakes. The study of earthquakes and their locations is known as seismology, a sub-discipline of geology. This involves understanding the tectonic forces that cause rocks to move, which can sometimes result in earthquakes. On the other hand, Bob, who studied sedimentary rocks, was likely more focused on layers of rocks that form from the accumulation of sediments over time, but not necessarily how they move. While geological processes can lead to the displacement of such rocks over vast periods of time, the primary focus in the study of sedimentary rocks is not their movement. Therefore, between the two brothers, Dan would have a better understanding of how and why rocks move several centimeters."},{"question":"What is the title of the 1983 film in which teenager Tom Cruise turns his parents home into a brothel?","response":"The 1983 film in which teenager Tom Cruise turns his parents' home into a brothel is titled \\"Risky Business.\\" This American teen sex comedy-drama film was directed and written by Paul Brickman, marking his directorial debut.

Q: So my girlfriend(22) recently got made at me(22) for watching a show on Netflix without her. A little background here; we both live at our respected parental units home as we are recent grads, she lives and hour away,we both enjoy watching tv shows a lot, but she has a tough time grasping overarching themes and some subtle signs in shows. So she loves so ask questions in the middle of shows, which I do not mind at all, especially if I’ve seen it before. However, I noticed that while we’re watching the show she tends not to pay attention. Either going on her phone, playing on her switch, or just straight up sleeping in the middle of our show. It’s not like we’re binging either, we may watch 2 or 3 episodes of a show in a given night and after the first I’m begging her to pay attention. I constantly say her name and asked if she caught what just happened. Most of the time she doesn’t catch what happened or understands not because she’s not smart but because she’s simply paying attention to something else. So I’ve begun to watch ahead for some of the shows I truly enjoy. Because we don’t live together it’s hard to see each other on the weekday with work and logistics. So she comes over on random Wednesday and be pissed that I watched 2 or 3 episodes ahead of her. I never explicitly told her I’d wait, she just kinda assumes I’ll wait. I don’t mind watching it over again w her at all either. It helps me answer her questions better and allows me to catch anything I may have missed.

But I don’t believe you have to have a lot for it to become burdensome. Money has always seemed to be a burden. Either you have it and the obligation and responsibility becomes a burden (so I’ve been told, ha) or you don’t have it and life without money becomes a burden. I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills. Let me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas. I was able to pay my bills and juggle things around to afford what the girls needed for school and what not. When I didn’t have money for something they wanted I felt like I carried the world on my shoulders. I didn’t let them know how stressful it all was because I felt like it was none of their business. They were kids and needed to be kids. They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn’t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids. Once, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her 5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around. She said “No, Mom, you can be dead-assed broke and the world is still going to go around.” That was when I quit letting money be a burden.

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

The figure highlights the company's newly aggressive stance against malicious or suspicious accounts in the wake of Russian disinformation efforts during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Last week, Twitter confirmed a Washington Post report that it had suspended 70 million accounts in May and June. The cavalcade of suspensions has raised questions as to whether the crackdown could affect Twitter's user growth and whether the company should have warned investors earlier. The new figure sheds light on Twitter's attempt to improve \\"information quality\\" on its service, its term for countering fake accounts, bots, disinformation, and other malicious occurrences. Such activity was rampant on Twitter and other social-media networks during the 2016 campaign, much of it originating with the Internet Research Agency, a since-shuttered Russian \\"troll farm\\" implicated in election-disruption efforts by the US special counsel and congressional investigations. Twitter declined to comment on the data. But its executives have said that efforts to clean up the platform are a priority, while acknowledging that its crackdown has affected and may continue to affect user numbers. (Netflix shares just took a beating over subscriber numbers.) Expand this summary.","response":"Twitter is a place where people can share their thoughts and communicate with others. However, sometimes people create fake accounts or use programs called \\"bots\\" to spread wrong information.

To fix this issue, Twitter started to find and remove these bad accounts towards the end of 2017. They removed a huge number, about 58 million accounts in just three months! They continued this work throughout 2018, removing 70 million more accounts. This helps make Twitter a safer and more trustworthy place for everyone. Some people wonder if removing all these accounts will make Twitter less popular or cause problems for the company.

They continue to scrape out of the mulch while measuring out the area and leads into one cutting the grass around the tree. After the grass has been trimmed, they then proceed to apply the measured mulch evenly across the base of the tree, ensuring a neat and aesthetically pleasing appearance. As a companion begins to water the area, another team member checks the branches for any signs of disease or damage to maintain the health of the tree. Simultaneously, other members of the group are focused on different tasks, such as pruning dead or overgrown branches, removing invasive weeds, and placing protective barriers for the tree against potential insects or pests. They work together, communicating effectively, and exchanging tools and ideas to achieve their shared goal of maintaining the tree and its surrounding landscape. As the work progresses, one member of the group skillfully captures the efforts on camera, documenting the process and occasionally directing others to provide the best angles and moments for their video or photo collection. This visual documentation serves not only as a testament to their collective hard work, but also as an informational resource for future tree care and preservation projects. Their ongoing dedication to the health and vitality of the tree not only improves the appearance and appeal of the local environment, but also ensures the continued survival of the tree, providing shade and benefits for the ecosystem that it supports.

Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects.

We have two groups of apples, one with 32 apples in it, and the other with 29 apples in it. 1. First, we want to see how many more apples are in the group with 32 than the group with 29. To do that, we can subtract 29 apples from both sides of the equation. 32 * v - 29 * v + 39 = 29 * v - 29 * v 2. Now, we find the difference in apples. (32 - 29) * v + 39 = 0 3 * v + 39 = 0 3. Our next step is to find out how many sets of three apples are there. We will do that by taking away the 39 from both sides of the equation. 3 * v + 39 - 39 = 0 - 39 3 * v = -39 4. Finally, let's see how many apples are in each group of three. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 3. (3 * v) / 3 = (-39) / 3 v = -13 So, the answer is v = -13. Which means there are -13 apples in each group of three. But since we can't have negative apples in real life, it's just a math answer that helps us practice and learn more about math!"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Neil Ellwood Peart, (born September 12, 1952), is a Canadian-American musician and author, best known as the drummer and primary lyricist for the rock band Rush.

Rebecca didn't enjoy the heat as much as Lindsey so","response":"Rebecca didn't enjoy the heat as much as Lindsey so she decided to take a different approach to make the most of their summer vacation together. Unlike Lindsey, who seemed to thrive under the incessant sun, soaking up its warmth with a smile on her face, Rebecca felt drained and irritable in the scorching temperatures. She longed for the comfort of a cooler climate and respite from the oppressive heat. Determined to find her place in the sun, Rebecca came up with an ingenious plan to adapt to the trying conditions. She thought that with some cooperation from Lindsey, they could discover an itinerary that both of them would enjoy. One morning, as they were lounging by the pool and sweating out their sunscreen, Rebecca turned to Lindsey and proposed her idea. \\"Hey, Lindsey, maybe instead of spending every day roasting ourselves by the pool, we could try some indoor activities and explore more of what this place has to offer. What do you think?\\" Much to her surprise, Lindsey was more than receptive to the suggestion.

The friends decided to create a list of attractions they would like to visit, comprising a mix of indoor and outdoor activities. They were sure to find the perfect balance between cooling off indoors and still enjoying the bright summer days. The following days were filled with adventures that made the most of both their preferences. They spent mornings exploring the local art galleries, museums, and shopping malls that offered air-conditioned comfort and an endless variety of experiences. These indoor activities rejuvenated Rebecca, who could then summon the energy to take on the more sun-soaked pursuits planned for the afternoons. Together, they enjoyed languid picnics under the canopies of banyan trees, swam in the gentle blue ocean waves, and hiked through dappled forests that provided enough shade to keep Rebecca cool. Lindsey was elated that their friendship seemed to have gotten even stronger through their shared activities. As dusk fell upon their vacation, Rebecca and Lindsey found themselves enamored with the breathtaking sunsets that painted the sky in hues of orange and magenta. It was in these quiet moments, with the sun taking its final bow for the day, that Rebecca realized that she had grown to appreciate the summer heat, all thanks to her faithful friend Lindsey's unwavering companionship and adaptability. In the end, despite her initial aversion to the heat, Rebecca managed to find her place in the sun by embracing its glow and discovering the beauty only summer days could offer.

It influences health, intelligence and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times.

Article: A book review tells not only what a book is about, but also how successful it is at what it is trying to do. Professors often assign book reviews as practice in careful analytical reading. As a reviewer, you bring together the two parts of accurate, analytical reading and strong, personal response when you indicate what the book is about and what it might mean to a reader. In other words, reviewers answer not only the WHAT but the SO WHAT question about a book. Thus, in writing a review, you combine the skills of describing what is on the page,analyzing how the book tried to achieve its purpose, and expressing your own reactions. Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book, like: Title. Author. Place of publication, publisher, date of publication. Number of pages. The review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say. The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again, so your readers don't have to look up to find this information. You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book, the purpose or audience for the book, and your reaction and evaluation.

The data that can be extracted from this sentence is as follows: 1. Car Models: a. DeSoto Custom: This car model is manufactured by DeSoto Custom, which is presumably an automotive company dedicated to producing the DeSoto. Since there is no specific model year mentioned for the DeSoto Custom, it can be assumed that it refers to the general production line under this model. b. Dodge Coronet: This car is not specified further in the sentence, but knowledge about automobile brands leads to the conclusion that it is produced by the Dodge automobile manufacturing company. Similarly, without a specific model year mentioned, it refers to the overall production line of this model. 2. Similarities: The sentence states that the DeSoto Custom and Dodge Coronet vehicles are alike, which implies that they share similarities in terms of design, features, or specifications. However, the specific details of these similarities are not provided. 3. Relation to the 1955 Dodge: The DeSoto Custom is mentioned to be related to the 1955 Dodge, which means there is a connection between these two car models.

With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Ivory Coast or Côte d'Ivoire , officially named the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, is a country located in West Africa. Ivory Coast's political capital is Yamoussoukro, and its economic capital and largest city is the port city of Abidjan.

The Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) is located south of Ivory Coast. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - The Bight of Benin or Bay of Benin is a bight in the Gulf of Guinea area on the western African coast. - Tegbessou (alternatively Tegbesu) or Bossa Ahadee was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbessou was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1718-1740), but was selected after Agaja's death to be the king after winning a succession struggle with a brother. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - Benin (or -; ), officially the Republic of Benin and formerly Dahomey, is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east, and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north. A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin, part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo, but the seat of government is in Cotonou, the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million. Benin is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation, highly dependent on agriculture, with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - The Cape of Good Hope (, ) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. - Dutch trading posts and plantations in the Americas precede the much wider known colonization activities of the Dutch in Asia. While the first Dutch fort in Asia was built in 1600 (in present-day Indonesia), the first forts and settlements on the Essequibo River in Guyana date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with other European nations. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of the 17th century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of Suriname until it gained independence in 1975, as well as the Netherlands Antilles, of which the islands remain within the Kingdom of the Netherlands today. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Fon people, also called Fon nu, Agadja or Dahomey, are a major West African ethnic and linguistic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Benin found particularly in its south region; they are also found in southwest Nigeria and Togo.

Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - Pepper Coast was the name given by European traders to a coastal area of western Africa, between Cape Mesurado and Cape Palmas. It encloses the present republic of Liberia. It got its name from the melegueta pepper. The pepper is also known as the \\"grain of paradise\\", which gave rise to an alternative name, the Grain Coast. The importance of the spice is shown by the designation of the area from the Saint John River (at present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the \\"Grain Coast\\" in honor of the availability of grains of paradise. In some cases (as shown on the map) this term covers a wider area incorporating Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. - The Oyo Empire was a Yoruba empire of what is today Western and North central Nigeria, and Eastern Benin. Established in the 15th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Yoruba, wealth gained from trade and its powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin to the west. - The Slave Coast is a historical name formerly used for parts of coastal West Africa along the Bight of Benin. The name is derived from the fact that it was a major source of African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade from the early 16th century to the 19th century. Other nearby coastal regions historically known by their prime colonial export are the Gold Coast, the Ivory Coast, and the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast). - Dutch West India Company (or ) was a chartered company (known as the \\"WIC\\") of Dutch merchants. Among its founding fathers was Willem Usselincx (15671647). On June 3, 1621, it was granted a for a trade monopoly in the West Indies (meaning the Caribbean) by the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and given jurisdiction over the Atlantic slave trade, Brazil, the Caribbean, and North America. The area where the company could operate consisted of West Africa (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Cape of Good Hope) and the Americas, which included the Pacific Ocean and the eastern part of New Guinea. The intended purpose of the charter was to eliminate competition, particularly Spanish or Portuguese, between the various trading posts established by the merchants. The company became instrumental in the Dutch colonization of the Americas. - Dahomey was an African kingdom (located in the area of the present-day country of Benin) that existed from about 1600 until 1894, when the last king, Behanzin, was defeated by the French, and the country was annexed into the French colonial empire. Dahomey developed on the Abomey Plateau amongst the Fon people in the early 17th century and became a regional power in the 18th century by conquering key cities on the Atlantic coast. - The Tropic of Cancer, also referred to as the Northern Tropic is north of the Equator. It is the most northerly circle of latitude on the Earth at which the Sun can be directly overhead. This occurs on the June solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun to its maximum extent. - Willem Usselincx (15671647) was a Flemish slave owner, slave trader, merchant, investor and diplomat who was instrumental in drawing both Dutch and Swedish attention to the importance of the New World.

A distinction is generally made between the \\"first colonial empire\\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the \\"second colonial empire\\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars in Vietnam (1955) and Algeria (1962), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960. - Agaja (also spelled Agadja and also known as Trudo Agaja or Trudo Audati) was a King of the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, who ruled from 1718 until 1740. He came to the throne after his brother King Akaba. During his reign, Dahomey expanded significantly and took control of key trade routes for the Atlantic slave trade by conquering Allada (1724) and Whydah (1727). Wars with the powerful Oyo Empire to the east of Dahomey resulted in Agaja accepting tributary status to that empire and providing yearly gifts. After this, Agaja attempted to control the new territory of the kingdom of Dahomey through militarily suppressing revolts and creating administrative and ceremonial systems. Agaja died in 1740 after another war with the Oyo Empire and his son Tegbessou became the new king. Agaja is credited with creating many of the key government structures of Dahomey, including the \\"Yovogan\\" and the \\"Mehu\\". - Allada is a town, arrondissement, and commune, located in the Atlantique Department of Benin.

Given the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\", is \\"Rinse it off\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"Yes, \\"Rinse it off\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\" after washing Riley's face with medical soap. To provide more context to this situation, let's consider the whole process of washing someone's face with medical soap - which is typically used as an antiseptic or for medical purposes like pre-operative skin preparation or wound cleansing. 1. Preparation: Bailey must have ensured that both their hands and Riley's face are clean prior to using the medical soap. Preparation usually involves removing any dirt, debris, or makeup on the face and ensuring that the environment is clean and hygienic. 2. Applying the medical soap: Bailey would have dispensed an appropriate amount of the medical soap in their hands and started gently applying it to Riley's face. This could involve circular motions with the fingertips, focusing on areas that require thorough cleansing or treatment. 3. Creating lather: If the medical soap is meant to be lathered up, Bailey would then work it into a foam-like consistency to ensure that all areas of the face are adequately covered. 4. Treatment time: Depending on the instructions provided with the medical soap, Bailey may have needed to leave it on Riley's face for a specific duration. This ensures that the soap has ample time to perform its intended function, such as killing bacteria or providing antiseptic benefits. 5. Rinsing off the medical soap: After the recommended time has elapsed, the next step would be to rinse off the soap from Riley's face. Using clean water, Bailey would gently splash or wipe away the soap, ensuring no residue is left behind. 6. Drying and aftercare: Once the soap has been completely rinsed off, Bailey should pat Riley's face dry using a clean towel and, if necessary, apply any additional aftercare products like moisturizer or wound dressings. Given this detailed process of washing a face with medical soap, it is clear that \\"Rinse it off\\" is a crucial and valid step in the procedure. This ensures that the face is clean, free of soap residue, and ready for any subsequent aftercare treatments."},{"question":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. Polyester, also known as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is a widely used thermoplastic polymer with a variety of applications, particularly in the textile and packaging industries. In the context of textiles, it has become popularly known as \\"polyester,\\" and it is commonly used to produce fibers for clothing, fabrics, and other textile products. It is known for its strength, durability, and resistance to wrinkles, which make it suitable for various types of fabrics. Additionally, polyester fibers blend well with other natural and synthetic fibers, allowing for the creation of a wide range of textiles with different properties and uses. On the other hand, when discussing packaging, PET is often used as the main term, and it is an essential material for one of the most common types of food-safe packaging: rigid plastic containers such as bottles, trays, and containers. The abbreviation \\"PET\\" is typically used in the context of packaging, primarily because other forms of polyester materials are not suitable or not commonly used in the packaging industry, and to distinguish it from textile applications. The reason for PET being widely used in the packaging sector is due to its excellent properties, which include: 1. Clarity and transparency: PET is a clear and transparent material, making it suitable for displaying products while protecting them from environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, and UV light. 2. Strength and impact resistance: PET boasts a high strength-to-weight ratio and is resistant to breaking or cracking. This characteristic ensures that products packaged in PET are well protected during transportation and handling. 3. Lightweight: PET has a low density, which means that it is lightweight, making it ideal for reducing shipping costs and overall material usage. 4. Recyclability: PET is highly recyclable, and its recycling process is efficient and well-developed. This factor contributes to the circular economy and reduces the overall environmental impact of packaging materials. 5. Barrier properties and chemical resistance: PET has excellent barrier properties against gases and moisture, making it ideal for packaging food and beverages, including sensitive and perishable products. Additionally, PET is resistant to a wide range of chemicals, which adds to its stability and suitability for packaging applications. In summary, the answer found on Google is correct. Polyester, known as PET in the context of packaging, is a versatile material used for various applications in both the textile and packaging industries. The terminology differs depending on the context in which it is used, with \\"polyester\\" referring to textile applications and \\"PET\\" primarily used when discussing packaging applications."},{"question":"CB4 was awful, but it may have given Cundieff the idea to it better.

Which general burned Atlanta in the American Civil War?","response":"General William Tecumseh Sherman, a Union Army leader, was responsible for the burning of Atlanta during the American Civil War. Born in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman's military career began as a graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1840. He held various positions in the military as well as in civilian life, but eventually returned to the army during the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Sherman is most famous for his \\"March to the Sea\\" campaign, which epitomized the concept of \\"total war\\" – a strategy designed to break the Confederacy's will to fight by destroying its resources and infrastructure. Known for his ruthless and uncompromising approach to warfare, Sherman sought to weaken the enemy's ability to wage war by attacking not only military targets but also civilian property, infrastructure, and resources. The burning of Atlanta was an important event in Sherman's campaign through the South, which began in the summer of 1864. At that time, Atlanta was a critical transportation hub and industrial center, providing vital support to the Confederate war effort. By capturing and subsequently destroying the city, Sherman intended to weaken the Confederate Army significantly and disrupt its supply lines and communication. On ascertaining that the city of Atlanta was a strategic military target, Sherman ordered his troops to lay siege to the city starting in July 1864. After several heated battles and skirmishes around the city, the Confederate defenders of Atlanta, led by General John Bell Hood, decided to abandon the position in September 1864. On September 2, 1864, Union forces entered Atlanta, essentially capturing it without much resistance. Following the capture of Atlanta, Sherman made the controversial decision to evacuate the city's civilian population to reduce the burden of providing for them, as they could interrupt the Union's military activities. The city was then largely abandoned to the Union forces, who remained stationed there for about two months. Before departing Atlanta and embarking on his legendary \\"March to the Sea,\\" Sherman realized the importance of leaving the city in a state that would render it useless to the Confederacy. From November 11-16, 1864, he ordered the systematic destruction of key infrastructure, military facilities, industrial targets, and civilian property. This destruction aimed at ensuring the Confederates could not utilize the resources when attempting to regain control of the city or maintain their war effort. The exact extent of the conflagration that ensued during the burning of Atlanta is a topic of historical debate, with some accounts suggesting that around 40% of the city was razed. However, it is clear that the burning had devastating consequences for both the inhabitants of the city and the Confederacy as a whole. Sherman's decision to burn Atlanta and his infamous \\"March to the Sea\\" attracted both praise and scorn. Some saw him as a genius military strategist for severing the Confederacy's heart and crippling its capacity to wage war, while others perceived him as a cruel and heartless commander. Despite the controversy surrounding his actions, it is undeniable that General William Tecumseh Sherman played a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of the American Civil War."},{"question":"Information: - Diane Crespo is a producer and director of feature films and documentaries .

It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors . Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids , including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body , as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles . The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is Tetraceratops insignis from the Lower Permian . Therapsids evolved from pelycosaurs ( specifically sphenacodonts ) 275 million years ago . They replaced the pelycosaurs as the dominant large land animals in the Middle Permian and were replaced , in turn , by the archosauromorphs in the Triassic , although one group of therapsids , the kannemeyeriiforms , remained diverse in the Late Triassic . The therapsids included the cynodonts , the group that gave rise to mammals in the Late Triassic around 225 million years ago . Of the non-mammalian therapsids , only cynodonts and dicynodonts survived the Triassic -- Jurassic extinction event . The last of the non-mammalian therapsids , the tritylodontid cynodonts , became extinct in the Early Cretaceous , approximately 100 million years ago . - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events.

That's incredible! How does the time machine work? Professor Leon: It's all based on complex quantum mechanics and my revolutionary theory of temporal displacement. By creating a focused energy field, this machine can bend the very fabric of spacetime itself, generating a temporal portal that allows us to travel to the past or future. Ada: That sounds both complicated and fascinating, Professor. But, I must ask, are there any potential dangers or consequences associated with time travel? Professor Leon: (pausing for a moment) That's a great question, Ada. Like any groundbreaking technology, time travel certainly has its risks. For one, the butterfly effect is something we must always keep in mind. Even the smallest action in the past could create drastic, unforeseen changes in the present. This is why we need to be extremely cautious when going back in time. Remember, our main goal is to learn and understand history, not to interfere with it. Ada: That makes sense. Now, what about traveling to the future? What possible problems might we face there? Professor Leon: Ah, the future. It's full of potential and numerous uncertainties. One of the main concerns is getting \\"trapped\\" in a future from which there is no return. Say, for example, an event occurs that prevents the time machine from functioning properly. In such a case, our traveler could be stranded in the future. Ada: Those risks do sound rather daunting. Yet, despite these concerns, the prospect of time travel is massively exciting. Have you had the chance to test the time machine yourself, Professor? Professor Leon: Not yet, Ada. I'm very close to perfecting the final adjustments on the machine. However, I still need to run a few more simulations and safety checks before I can confidently send someone through time. It's imperative that the machine is foolproof before we embark on our first journey. Ada: Well, I'm sure the world can't wait for the news of your breakthrough. Just imagine all the incredible possibilities that time travel would unlock! Professor, do you already have plans for where – or rather, when – you're going to visit first? Professor Leon: (smiling) It's been the hardest decision so far, but I think my first destination will be to visit some of the greatest scientific minds in history: Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albert Einstein. I long to have a conversation with them, to learn from their experiences and see firsthand how they shaped the world of science. Ada: That sounds incredible, Professor Leon. I can't wait to read about your experiences, and I'm sure the rest of the world will be just as eager. Thank you for sharing your exciting invention with us! Professor Leon: It was my pleasure, Ada.

Police, EMT personnel and firefighters were called to the two-story, colonial-style home of police Capt. Mark Anderko shortly before 4 a.m. on May 20. Anderko was in the house with his wife, two children and 92-year old mother. The fire was extinguished within 10 to 15 minutes and there were no injuries, but the house was damaged. \\"The investigators described it as considerable, one part of the house had damage on the first and second floor of the home, \\" said Jim O'Neil, spokesman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. Dotro, 35, was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated arson, authorities said. A nine-year veteran of the Edison police department, he was suspended from his job with pay. Dotro's lawyer, Lawrence Bitterman, said that his client is \\"in shock\\" and had told Bitterman that \\"he can't believe he's being arrested.\\" Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz on Friday upheld previously set bail conditions on Friday, which included a 5 million bail. If the bail is posted, Dotro must surrender his firearms and passport and may not have any contact with the victims. 1. When did law enforcement respond to the scene? 2.

Wipe the bowl with vinegar and a cloth. Rinse and dry the bowl thoroughly. Put everything back into the bowl and top it off with bottled water. Article:","response":"Title: Keeping Your Aquarium Clean and Healthy: A Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Fish Tank Introduction A well-maintained aquarium can be a stunning and fascinating addition to any home. It provides a delightful and relaxing setting while offering a glimpse into the lives of beautiful and unique aquatic creatures. However, maintaining and cleaning an aquarium can be a daunting and time-consuming task, as it is essential to ensure the well-being of your fish. Fortunately, with the right tools and techniques, cleaning your fish tank can become an easy and straightforward process. In this article, we will guide you step-by-step to clean your aquarium effectively using a shop vac, vinegar, and bottled water. Step 1: Suck Up Dirt and Waste with a Shop Vac The first step in cleaning your aquarium is removing dirt and waste from the tank using a shop vac. Before you begin, it is essential to unplug all electrical devices in the tank and remove any decorations, plants, and fish from the bowl for their safety. A shop vac, also known as a wet/dry vacuum cleaner, is specifically designed to deal with large amounts of debris in a short amount of time. Follow these steps to clean the tank using a shop vac: 1. Remove any aquarium accessories, plants, and decorations before vacuuming. 2. Carefully suction out all visible dirt, waste, and debris from the tank. Be cautious of gravel or small stones, as you may need to adjust the suction strength of the vacuum accordingly. 3. Regularly check and empty the shop vac's collection container, ensuring that it does not overflow. Step 2: Wipe the Bowl with Vinegar and a Cloth Once you have removed the majority of dirt and waste from your aquarium, you must clean the glass and other surfaces thoroughly. Vinegar is an excellent natural cleaning agent that can effectively remove stains, algae, and dirt without harming your aquatic pets. To clean the aquarium glass with vinegar, use a soft, non-abrasive cloth and follow these steps: 1. Mix equal parts of distilled white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. 2. Generously spray the aquarium surfaces, avoiding any live plants or decorations that may be sensitive to vinegar. 3. Gently scrub the glass and other surfaces of the tank with a cloth, paying close attention to crevices and corners where dirt and algae may accumulate. 4. Once the surfaces are clean, use a separate cloth soaked in clean water to remove any residual vinegar from the tank. Step 3: Rinse and Dry the Bowl Thoroughly After cleaning the aquarium with vinegar, ensure that it is thoroughly rinsed and dried to remove any leftover debris, cleaning solution, or mineral deposits from the water. To do this: 1. Fill the empty aquarium with clean water and swirl it around to rinse off the glass and other surfaces. 2. Dispose of the rinsing water and repeat the process until the tank is completely free of vinegar or any other contaminants. 3. Wipe and pat dry the aquarium with a clean cloth or paper towels before proceeding to the next step. Step 4: Put Everything Back into the Bowl and Top It Off with Bottled Water Reassemble your aquarium by returning the plants, decorations, and fish to their respective places inside the tank. It is essential to ensure that your fish have a comfortable and stable environment after cleaning, which is why we recommend topping off your aquarium with bottled water. Bottled water typically has fewer impurities and contaminants than tap water, ensuring that your fish thrive in a healthy environment. To complete this step: 1. Carefully place the plants, decorations, and accessories back into the cleaned aquarium. 2. Reintroduce your fish to the aquarium, taking care not to shock them by gradually acclimating them to the new water. 3. Fill the aquarium with bottled water, ensuring that there is enough space for your fish to swim comfortably and the water level is suitable for your aquarium's filtration system. Conclusion Cleaning your aquarium may seem like a daunting task, but by following this step-by-step guide, you can easily maintain a clean and healthy environment for your fish. Using a shop vac, vinegar, and bottled water to clean and refill your tank not only ensures the well-being of your aquatic friends but also guarantees a stunning and thriving aquatic display in your home."},{"question":"After a huge win on the road, the Steelers returned home for a game against the Buccaneers.

John was a bank clerk and Agnes was a pianist. Joan's two older sisters, Betty and Mary Brodel, shared their mother's musical interest and started to learn how to play instruments, such as the saxophone and the banjo, at an early age. They began performing in front of audiences in acts that included singing and dancing. In 1936, Leslie caught the attention of a talent scout from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) when the three Brodel sisters were performing in New York. She was given a six-month contract with the studio, earning 200 per week. While working at the studio, she attended MGM's Little Red Schoolhouse with other child actors like Mickey Rooney and Freddie Bartholomew. Her first film role was in Camille (1936), a romantic drama starring Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor. She played Taylor's younger sister Marie Jeanette, but her speaking scenes were deleted and she was uncredited. MGM had trouble finding suitable roles for her, and she was let go by the studio along with Deanna Durbin. Leslie returned to New York, working on the radio and as a model. During this time, her older sister Mary was signed to Universal Studios. Leslie returned to Hollywood with the rest of her family, working for different studios as a freelancer. She mainly worked for RKO Pictures. Leslie was selected to play a small role in Men with Wings (1938). While shooting the film, director William A. Wellman discovered that Leslie's mother had lied about her daughter's age and that she was only thirteen years old. For the remainder of the filming schedule, Wellman replaced her with Mary. Leslie gained her first credited role in Winter Carnival (1939) as Betsy Phillips. She was chosen for the part because the director was searching for an actress with a southern accent. She was billed as Joan Brodel. Later that year, she co-starred with Jimmy Lydon in Two Thoroughbreds, in which she played the daughter of a horse owner. At age 15, Leslie was selected by a group of Hollywood directors as one of 13 \\"baby stars of 1940.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is an example of one of Joan's early roles?","response":"An example of one of Joan's early roles is Betsy Phillips in Winter Carnival (1939)."},{"question":"Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"how many australian states and territories?\\" Answer:","response":"There are 6 states and 10 territories in Australia, but only 8 of these territories are considered as Australian territories: 6 states and 2 mainland territories."},{"question":"The Jones family went jogging last Saturday.

The modern scientific or polite words \`\` vulva '' and \`\` vagina '' both stem from Latin , but originally they had different meanings . The different words '' Vulva \`\` and '' Vagina \`\` are both from Latin , but originally they had modern scientific or polite meanings .","response":"First, let's break down the sentences and analyze their components to compare their meanings: Sentence 1: - The modern scientific or polite words \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina\\" both stem from Latin - Originally, they had different meanings Sentence 2: - The different words \\"Vulva\\" and \\"Vagina\\" are both from Latin - Originally, they had modern scientific or polite meanings Now let's analyze and compare the sentences: 1. Both sentences mention that \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina\\" are from Latin, which indicates that the words have a common linguistic origin. 2. Sentence 1 states that the words had different meanings originally, which implies that these terms have evolved to relate to similar concepts in modern times. Sentence 2 also mentions that the words are different but does not refer explicitly to the shift or evolution in their meanings. It can be inferred but is less explicit. 3. Sentence 1 describes the terms as modern scientific or polite words, emphasizing the contemporary usage and context for these terms. Sentence 2, however, states that the terms originally had modern scientific or polite meanings, which seems to be contradictory since it refers to their original (i.e., non-modern) meanings. This part is unclear and possibly incorrect. In conclusion, the two sentences do not have the same meaning. While they both reference the Latin origin of the words \\"vulva\\" and \\"vagina,\\" the first sentence focuses on how the words have evolved over time and become modern scientific or polite terms, while the second sentence has an unclear and possibly incorrect reference to the original meanings of the terms."},{"question":"Brown signed a reserve/future contract with the Rams on Monday.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's examine each sentence step by step and evaluate their logic. Sentence A: \\"She brings a sandwich wrapped in newspaper for lunch every day.\\" 1. She brings a sandwich: This part is logical. People often bring sandwiches for lunch. 2. Wrapped in newspaper: This part might not be highly common, but it's not entirely illogical. People may use various materials to wrap food, although newspaper ink could transfer onto the sandwich, which could be a concern. Sentence B: \\"She brings a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil for lunch every day.\\" 1. She brings a sandwich: Again, this part is logical as mentioned earlier. 2. Wrapped in aluminum foil: This part is logical as well. Aluminum foil is a common material used to wrap food for transportation, preservation, and avoiding contamination. Based on the step-by-step evaluation, Sentence A appears to be less logical than Sentence B, as using newspapers to wrap food isn't a very common or practical choice due to concerns about ink transfer and contamination. Therefore, Sentence A: \\"She brings a sandwich wrapped in newspaper for lunch every day\\" is the sentence that is not logical."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Question: What room does Vollin perish in?

Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe-inspired traps.

Therefore, instead of offering a simple, concise sentence, I will provide an elaboration on what makes an impactful brief sentence. A well-constructed brief sentence typically incorporates a subject, a verb, and an object, thereby successfully conveying the essential message concisely and efficiently. One of the most powerful aspects of a brief sentence is its ability to grab the attention of the reader or listener, especially when placed strategically within a larger body of text or during verbal communication. In fact, a well-placed brief sentence can often stand out amongst paragraphs with longer and more complex sentences. When crafting a brief sentence, the writer should choose each word carefully, ensuring optimal clarity, readability, and effectiveness. Although brief sentences may seem simple, their ability to convey a message effectively is often a mark of skillful language use. The importance of precision in word choice cannot be overstated, as a brief sentence leaves little room for unnecessary or vague language. Furthermore, the sentence must adhere to grammatical rules and structures, including the use of proper punctuation. Brief sentences can serve multiple purposes. They may function as thesis statements, providing a clear and concise summary of the writer's primary argument or position. They can work as transition statements, bridging the gap between separate ideas or sections within a larger work. Alternatively, they may serve as a means of emphasis, summarizing a key point and driving it home for the audience. Despite their short length, brief sentences have the potential to convey powerful messages and emotions, making them a valuable tool in many different kinds of communication. Embracing the art of brevity when expressing oneself can contribute to a more engaging, efficient, and effective language.

Donald, his chest heaving with each breath, couldn't shake the nagging thought that perhaps he had let his anger get the best of him. But his pride prevented him from admitting it. All the while, Joel fought to keep his emotions in check, aware that responding in kind could only make matters worse. Step 5: Set the stage for potential consequences. The room's atmosphere grew thick with tension, like a rubber band stretched to its breaking point. One wrong move by either party could set off a chain reaction that nobody wanted to witness. Step 6: Present possible turning points for the story. At that very moment, a knock on the door startled everyone, momentarily disrupting the palpable hostility in the air.

Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it. Especially, when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time, so that was why I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres. Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another.

How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","response":"To find out how many students got a final grade of B and above, we need to follow these steps: 1. Determine the percentage of students who got a final grade of B and above. 2. Apply this percentage to the total number of students in the class to find the number of students. Step 1: Determine the percentage of students who got a final grade of B and above. Since we know that 40% of the students got a final grade below B, we can find the percentage of students who got a final grade of B and above by subtracting 40% from 100%. 100% - 40% = 60% So, 60% of the students got a final grade of B and above. Step 2: Apply this percentage to the total number of students in the class. Mr. Sanchez has a total of 60 students in Grade 5. To find out how many students got a final grade of B and above, we apply the percentage (60%) to the total number of students: (60% * 60 students) = (0.6 * 60) = 36 students Therefore, 36 students in Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 class got a final grade of B and above."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. I am facing a new situation today: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Springfield have more or less air pollution than Nillmar? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article, Springfield, the city that relies on nuclear power for its energy production, is likely to have less air pollution compared to Nillmar, which uses coal as its primary source of electricity production. The reason for this difference in air pollution levels stems from the distinct methods of energy production used by each city. When coal is burned to generate electricity, it releases a variety of pollutants into the atmosphere. These pollutants include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and even heavy metals like mercury. The burning of coal also contributes to the production of carbon dioxide, which is a significant greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. As a result, Nillmar, being primarily powered by coal, would exhibit higher levels of air pollution due to the release of these harmful substances during the energy production process. On the other hand, Springfield uses nuclear power as its energy source. The primary advantage of using nuclear fission for energy production is that it does not release harmful air pollutants during the process. Nuclear fission reactions generate heat, which is used to produce steam, which in turn drives turbines to produce electricity. Compared to burning fossil fuels, like coal, nuclear fission is a much cleaner process as it emits no greenhouse gases or other pollutants that contribute to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. However, it is important to note that there is still some environmental impact associated with the nuclear power production process. This mainly involves the disposal and storage of radioactive waste, which poses different sets of challenges and risks. Nevertheless, when strictly comparing the air pollution levels between the two energy sources, Springfield would have less air pollution due to its reliance on nuclear fission. In conclusion, the alien in the given scenario would likely report back to his superiors that Springfield, with its nuclear power source, experiences lower levels of air pollution compared to Nillmar, which relies on the burning of coal to generate electricity. This difference in air quality demonstrates the environmental advantages and drawbacks associated with each method of energy production, and highlights the need for continuous efforts in developing and implementing clean energy solutions on Earth."},{"question":"Hunting: In most parts of medieval Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin Hood legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they \\"hunt the King's deer\\". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Who did Anglophone colonies democratically glorify hunting for?","response":"Anglophone colonies democratically glorified hunting for all people, meaning everyone could enjoy hunting."},{"question":"Information: - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'religion'.","response":"The subject entity is \\"Jesus Christ\\" and the object entity is \\"Christianity\\"."},{"question":"Given the question: Information: - Multi-purpose stadiums are a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events. While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event, this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity. It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most popular outdoor team sports football and baseball require radically different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges. - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - Sermersooq (\\"Place of Much Ice\\") is a new municipality in Greenland, operational from 1 January 2009. It is home to Nuuk (formerly called Godthåb), the capital of Greenland, and is the most populous municipality in the country, with 21,868 inhabitants as of January 2013. The municipality consists of former municipalities of eastern and southwestern Greenland, each named after the largest settlement at the time of formation: - Nuuk is the capital and largest city of Greenland. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a quarter of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316, making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population. - Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Nuuk , Greenland . It is currently used mostly for football matches . The stadium has a capacity for 2,000 . - A stadium (plural stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event. - Iqaluit is the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut; its largest community, and its only city. Until 1987, the city was known as Frobisher Bay, after the large bay on the coast of which the city is situated. In 1999, Iqaluit became the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories. Before this event, Iqaluit was (relatively speaking) an insignificant city and not well-known outside of the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensively imported supplies as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road, rail, or even ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city also possesses a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island; this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, even though the city is well south of the Arctic Circle. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The oral Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit Sign Language is a critically endangered language isolate spoken in Nunavut. - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay.

Article: It is probably the strangest sport anyone has ever invented. And at first sight, it looks like the easiest. Competitors have to do two things. The first is to stand still. The second is to place their hand anywhere on the body of a car, and keep it there. This is where things start getting difficult. Lots of other people are doing the same thing. And the winner of the \\"handathon\\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time. That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation. Most say they will prepare by \\"getting lots of sleep\\". Others say they will \\"eat healthy food\\" or \\"pray for success\\". The whole event gives ordinary people the chance to do something interesting and win something at the end. Handathons are competitions, but there is little rivalry between the competitors. They help each other out and keep each other's spirits up. People who drop out early return with food, drink and encouragement for those still standing.

If x gallons of the 2 percent grade, y gallons of the 3 percent grade, and z gallons of the 5 percent grade are mixed to give x+y+z gallons of a 4 percent grade, what is x in terms of y and z? Options: (A) y + 3z (B) (y +z) / 4 (C) 2y + 3z (D) z/2 (E) 3y + 4.5z Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the value of x in terms of y and z, we can begin by setting up an equation that represents the given problem. We know how much fat is in each grade of milk (percentages), and we want to combine them to create a 4 percent mixture. We can start by expressing the fat amount in each grade by multiplying their volumes by their respective fat percentages: - 2 percent grade: 0.02x - 3 percent grade: 0.03y - 5 percent grade: 0.05z Now, we want to mix them together to obtain a 4 percent mixture. The total gallons of milk in the mixture would be (x+y+z), and the total fat in this mixture would be 4 percent of this volume, which is 0.04(x+y+z). Since the fat content of each milk grade, when mixed, must equal the fat content of the total mixture, we can set the sum of the individual fat contents equal to the total mixture: 0.02x + 0.03y + 0.05z = 0.04(x+y+z) Now, we can solve it for x in terms of y and z: 0.02x + 0.03y + 0.05z = 0.04x + 0.04y + 0.04z Subtracting 0.04x, 0.04y, and 0.04z from both sides to isolate x: -0.02x = -0.01y - 0.01z Now, divide by -0.02: x = (1/2)y + (1/2)z So, the answer is: x = (1/2)(y + z) Therefore, the correct option is (B) (y + z) / 4."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Q: Abstract: The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks underlying cell differentiation from high-throughput gene expression and chromatin data remains a challenge. Here, we derive dynamic gene regulatory networks for human myeloid differentiation using a 5-day time series of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. We profile HL-60 promyelocytes differentiating into macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. We find a rapid response in the expression of key transcription factors and lineage markers that only regulate a subset of their targets at a given time, which is followed by chromatin accessibility changes that occur later along with further gene expression changes. We observe differences between promyelocyte- and monocyte-derived macrophages at both the transcriptional and chromatin landscape level, despite using the same differentiation stimulus, which suggest that the path taken by cells in the differentiation landscape defines their end cell state. More generally, our approach of combining neighboring time points and replicates to achieve greater sequencing depth can efficiently infer footprint-based regulatory networks from long series data..

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \\"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\\" He further stated: \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.

Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of 2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of AlO (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion. Individual elements can often form multiple oxides, each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen. In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in other cases by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Certain elements can form many different oxides, such those of nitrogen. - Koskullskulle is a locality situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 874 inhabitants in 2010. - Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores. With the chemical formula FeO, it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore. - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods. - Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above . - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921). - Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (72.4% Fe), hematite (69.9% Fe), goethite (62.9% Fe), limonite or siderite (48.2% Fe). - Luleå Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Luleå, which is also the county seat of Norrbotten County. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Main Line Through Upper Norrland is a long railway line between Bräcke, Jämtland County and Boden, Norrbotten County in Sweden. For military and regional policy reasons, it was built in very sparsely populated areas, far away from the more densely populated coast. The line has several branches to settlements on the coast, the ones to Umeå and Luleå being considered part of the line itself. Today the three largest settlements along the line are Boden (pop 18800), Älvsbyn (pop 5500) and Vännäs (pop 4100). - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014. - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. - Northern or North Sami (disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp), sometimes also simply referred to as Sami, is the most widely spoken of all Sami languages. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden. - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family. - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB). - Svappavaara is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 417 inhabitants in 2010. It is a mining village. Mining was started around 1650. Large scale iron mining started in 1965. The mine was closed in 1983, but enrichment of iron ore from the mine at Kiruna is still going on. The mine is owned by LKAB, and there is an ongoing project to open it again for production around year 2015. - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east. - Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nHO, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Goethite (FeO(OH)), named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832), an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group, is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri or Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid- 17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Luleå made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology . - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - SSAB AB, earlier \\"Svenskt Stål AB\\" (English: Swedish Steel), is a Swedish-Finnish company, formed in 1978 and specialised in processing raw material to steel. The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland. - An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - Luossavaara (Northern Sami: \\"Luossavárri\\") is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden. It is the site of a now-inactive iron ore mine formerly operated by the Swedish mining company LKAB. Today it has a ski lift and slope, as well as a hiking path called \\"Midnattsolstigen\\" (the Midnight Sun Trail). - Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - The Ofoten Line is a railway line in Narvik, Norway. It runs from the Port of Narvik to Riksgränsen on the NorwaySweden border, where the line continues as the Ore Line via Kiruna and Gällivare to Luleå. The Ofoten Line is single track, electrified at and has seven stations. The line only connects to the rest of the Norwegian railway network via Sweden. The main traffic is up to twelve daily freight trains operated by Malmtrafik that haul iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. In addition, CargoNet operates container trains, branded as the Arctic Rail Express (ARE), and SJ operates passenger trains, including a night train to Stockholm. The Ofoten Line is also part of the Northern East West Freight Corridor, which hauls containers from China and India to North America. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards. - Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO). It takes its name from the Greek word \\"sideros,\\" iron. It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Sami is a group of Uralic languages spoken by the Sami people in Northern Europe (in parts of northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and extreme northwestern Russia). There are, depending on the nature and terms of division, ten or more Sami languages. Several names are used for the Sami languages: \\"Saami\\", \\"Sámi\\", \\"Saame\\", \\"Samic\\", \\"kukhulas\\", as well as the exonyms \\"Lappish\\" and \\"Lappic\\". The last two, along with the term \\"Lapp\\", are now often considered derogatory. - Gällivare (or ) is a locality and the seat of Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,449 inhabitants in 2010. The town was founded in the 17th century. Together with nearby towns Malmberget and Koskullskulle it forms a conurbation with some 15,000 inhabitants. This conurbation is the second northernmost significant urban area of Sweden after Kiruna. - The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year. - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare. - The Iron Ore Line is a long railway line between Riksgränsen and Boden in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The line contains two branches, from Kiruna to Svappavaara and from Gällivare to Koskullskulle. The term is often colloquially used to also include the Ofoten Line, from Riksgränsen to Narvik in Norway, and the northernmost part of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland from Boden to Luleå. The railway from Narvik to Luleå is long. - Norrbotten County (\\"Norrbottens län\\") is the northernmost county or \\"län\\" of Sweden. It borders Västerbotten County to the southwest, the Gulf of Bothnia to the southeast. It also borders the counties of Nordland and Troms in Norway to the northwest, and Lapland Province in Finland to the northeast. - Aktiebolag (\\"stock company\\") is the Swedish term for \\"limited company\\" or \\"corporation\\". When used in company names, it is abbreviated AB (in Sweden), Ab (in Finland), or A/B (for some older companies), roughly equivalent to the abbreviations \\"Ltd\\" and \\"PLC\\". The State authority responsible for registration of aktiebolag in Sweden is called the Swedish Companies Registration Office. - Riksgränsen, \\"The National Border\\" in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle.

Solve -580*u + 358*u + 19422 = 857*u for u.","response":"To solve the equation -580*u + 358*u + 19422 = 857*u for the variable u, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -580*u and 358*u are like terms because they both have the variable u. To combine them, simply add their coefficients: -580*u + 358*u = (-580 + 358)*u = -222*u The equation now becomes: -222*u + 19422 = 857*u Step 2: Move the term with the variable (u) to one side of the equation. To get all the terms involving u on one side and the constants on the other side, add 222*u to both sides of the equation: -222*u + 222*u + 19422 = 857*u + 222*u Simplifying this gives: 19422 = 1079*u Step 3: Isolate u by dividing by the coefficient. Now, we have an equation with u on one side and a constant on the other side. To isolate u, divide both sides by the coefficient of u (which is 1079): 19422 / 1079 = 1079*u / 1079 This simplifies to: u = 19422 / 1079 Step 4: Calculate the value of u. Now we have the value of u in a fraction form. To get its exact value, divide 19422 by 1079: u = 18 Thus, the solution to the equation -580*u + 358*u + 19422 = 857*u is u = 18."},{"question":"Here's a logic test: An orange experiences more friction rolling across a grove floor compared to a dining table.

This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Input: Question: Viruses were assumed to exist before they were first seen with an electron microscope in which decade? Answer: 1930 ' s Output:","response":"Supporting Fact 1: Prior to the 1930s, scientists had observed negative effects on organisms, such as diseases, but could not directly visualize the causative agents due to the limitations of light microscopes, which had a resolution of only 0.2 micrometers. They presumed these agents to be viruses, which are much smaller than bacteria. Supporting Fact 2: The discovery and use of the electron microscope, developed in the early 1930s by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, allowed for much higher resolution (50 picometers) and magnification, enabling scientists to finally visualize these extremely small particles. Supporting Fact 3: After the electron microscope's invention, researchers in the 1930s managed to visualize the tobacco mosaic virus's structure, which provided substantial evidence for the existence of viruses. This discovery was significant because it helped to solidify the understanding that viruses cause specific diseases in organisms. Supporting Fact 4: The existence of viruses was further supported by the development of new laboratory techniques that allowed researchers to isolate, cultivate, and study the characteristics of these infectious particles. Methods such as viral cultivation in host organisms and filtration techniques provided further evidence, even before their visualization under the electron microscope. Supporting Fact 5: During the 1930s, significant advancements were made in virology as well, including the concept of virus-host interactions, mechanisms of infection, and the identification of specific viral strains. These scientific developments strengthened the understanding of viral existence and their role in causing diseases in the living organisms."},{"question":"Two brothers got sick and weren't feeling well.

The Isle of Forgotten Voices is an ancient local legend that embodies long-lost tales and experiences that have slipped into collective oblivion. According to the myth, whenever something or someone is forgotten, their essence becomes trapped in an ethereal island where their voices echo and long to be heard once again. When Roy arrives, he is initially intrigued by the enigmatic folklore and tries to gather more information for his next book. As Roy delves deeper into unraveling the mystery, he starts encountering people around the village claiming to have witnessed ghostly apparitions of long-lost relatives, friends, and lovers. They believe these apparitions are a sign that the Isle of Forgotten Voices is calling them and pleading for their help. Despite the locals' strange experiences, Roy remains skeptical but cannot ignore the intense pull towards the island. During a rainy night, Roy walks along the shoreline and suddenly hears the faint voices of his deceased parents and younger sister, all of whom perished in a tragic accident years ago and blames himself for their untimely demise. Overcome by fear and curiosity, Roy decides to seek help from the village's wise elder, Augustina. She explains to him that the Isle of Forgotten Voices serves as a bridge between worlds – the living and the dead – and that helping the forgotten souls would set them free. To save his family and discover the secret of the Isle, Roy forms a team with a courageous young fisherman, Sara, and a resourceful historian, Diego. Together, they embark on a perilous journey across the treacherous ocean and uncover the isle's hidden history – from ancient Celtic lore to battles gone untold. The Isle of Forgotten Voices reveals itself to be not only a pathway for forgotten souls, but also a sanctuary for forgotten stories. As they explore the eerie island, the trio slowly releases the trapped souls and forgotten stories, allowing them to find solace and reintegrate into the memories of those who have forgotten them. In the process, Roy uncovers a shocking revelation that his own family's history is intertwined with the Isle, and in embracing and sharing its tales, he can finally face his personal grief and reconcile with the loss of his loved ones. As the last soul takes flight, the Isle of Forgotten Voices vanishes, signaling the end of an era of forgetfulness.

[…] One of the current trending products in the muscle-building supplement market is Xtreme No. Many fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders in Carletonville, South Africa, are trying to find reviews and information about this supplement to determine if it will help them achieve their desired muscle mass. The competition among muscle-building supplements is fierce, with each product claiming to be the best. Among these products, Super Charge Xtreme No has received a significant number of positive reviews, making it a popular choice for many seeking to boost their muscle mass and overall body weight. However, there are always skeptics wondering if these products truly work as advertised. As with any supplement, results vary among individuals, but it is essential to examine the ingredients, potential benefits, and side effects before incorporating a new supplement into one's routine. Xtreme No is marketed as a nitric oxide booster. Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring gas in the body that assists in a variety of functions, especially in the areas of blood circulation and oxygen transport. This product contains L-arginine, an amino acid that boosts nitric oxide production. When properly used, Xtreme No can potentially: 1. Increase muscle mass - The improved blood flow provides muscles with the necessary nutrients to grow faster and larger. 2. Enhance strength and endurance - Heightened blood circulation means adequate oxygen transport, which reduces fatigue and results in better overall performance during workouts. 3. Promote faster recovery - The boosted blood flow allows for quicker healing and reduced muscle soreness after intense workouts. 4. Improve pumps - With better nutrient and oxygen delivery, muscles experience more powerful and pronounced pumps during workouts. Comparing Xtreme No to Super Charge Xtreme No can be difficult since both products claim to deliver similar benefits. When deciding on a supplement, it's crucial to look at the ingredient list, user reviews, and product history to make an informed decision. When assessing the effectiveness of Xtreme No, here are a few factors to consider: 1. Ingredients - Xtreme No contains L-arginine, as well as other natural elements that promote muscle mass and improve circulation. 2. User reviews - It's helpful to evaluate user reviews to understand others' experiences using Xtreme No. As with any supplement, results may vary between individuals, but by reviewing available testimonials, one can gauge the product's effectiveness. 3. Safety - Before introducing a new supplement into your routine, consult with a healthcare professional to ensure that it's safe for your specific needs. Be sure to consider any known allergies or pre-existing medical conditions. In conclusion, Xtreme No and Super Charge Xtreme No both show promise as nitric oxide-boosting muscle building supplements. It's essential to carefully review each product's ingredients, user testimonials, and safety precautions before choosing the best option for you. Remember, the key to success in muscle building lies in commitment, proper nutrition, and diligent training. Supplements like Xtreme No and Super Charge Xtreme No are meant to be used in conjunction with these fundamentals to help you reach your fitness goals."},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Yougetexperiencedevelopingandcommunicatinginsights,recommendations,conceptsandsolutionstoourcustomers.","response":"You get experience developing and communicating insights, recommendations, concepts and solutions to our customers."},{"question":"Article: It probably goes without saying because the goal is always to make your first meeting with a new person positive, but it's especially important with college girls, who probably have plenty of date options on campus. That's why you want to take care with your appearance and be polite and attentive when you first make contact. If you're talking to a girl at party, make sure you haven't had too much to drink. While liquid courage may make it easier to approach her, she probably isn't going to be impressed if you're slurring your words and having trouble staying on your feet. To show that you have genuine interest in a girl, you should want to learn more about her. Asking open-ended questions, rather than simple yes-no inquiries, usually works best because it gives her a chance to really share her experiences, feelings, and opinions with you. Be more creative than simply asking her what her major is or which dorm she lives in. She probably hears those questions a lot. Instead, try to build off of what she says. For example, if she tells you that she loves traveling, ask her what her favorite trip was and why. If you want a girl to take your interest in her seriously, it helps to show that you're still thinking about her when you're not together. Phone calls or texts can help establish a rapport that makes her feel comfortable with you, so she's more willing to say yes when you ask for a date. If you're not sure what to stay in your phone call or text, ask a follow-up question to your last conversation, share an inside joke about the last time you saw her, or tell her that you saw something that reminded you of her. Don't just call or text late at night -- she might get the wrong idea. Once you feel like you've gotten to know her, there's nothing left to do but ask her out. You don't have to be formal, though. Ask her if she'd like to hang out sometime, and if she says yes, suggest a day and time. It's normal to be nervous before you ask a girl out. Give yourself a little pep talk before you do it, reminding yourself of all your positive qualities. You don't have to take her out for a candlelit dinner right out of the gate. In fact, it's usually best to make your first outing a low pressure situation, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or having lunch at the student union. However, you should choose a venue that allows for quality conversation, so a movie or noisy bar probably isn't the best option. Once you've gone on a few casual dates, you can progress to more typical outings, such as dinner at a nice restaurant. When you're in college, you usually don't have too much money. That doesn't mean you can't take a girl on memorable dates. Some inexpensive date ideas include a school sporting event, a picnic in a local park, or a movie marathon at home. What is a summary of what this article is about?","response":"The article emphasizes the importance of making a positive first impression while meeting college girls and offers advice on how to achieve this. Key points include maintaining a good appearance, being polite and attentive, engaging in meaningful conversations through open-ended questions, establishing rapport through phone calls or texts, and eventually asking the person out. It also suggests picking low-pressure and budget-friendly date ideas to start off the relationship, allowing for good conversation and memorable experiences."},{"question":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Can you be too beautiful? It is hardly a problem that most of us have to bother -- as much as we might like to dream that it were the case. Yet the blessings and curses of beauty have been a long-standing interest in psychology. Do those blessed with shiny faces and an attractive body live in a cloud of appreciation -- or does it sometimes pay to be ordinary? Combing through decades of findings, social psychologists Lisa Slattery Walker and Tonya Frevert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte havereviewed all the evidence to dateand their conclusions are not what you might expect. At the most basic level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo around it; we see that someone has one good quality, and by association, our deep mind may assume that they have other good ones too. Even in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive criminals are likely to get less strict sentences, or to escape punishment entirely; attractive plaintiffs , meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. \\"It's an effect seen everywhere,\\" says Walker. But if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can have opposite results. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, hidden sexist prejudices can work against attractive women, making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs that require power. And as you might expect, good-looking people of both sexes run into envy -- one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to employ you if they judge that you are more attractive than they are. More worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people. And the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One...

I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller \\"was\\" Tarzan and I wouldn't understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape. It wasn't after many years that I came across \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\", and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong, self minded, active and \\"no-inhibitions\\" woman as Jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (Tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the \\"Janes\\" to come such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. O'Sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the movie is Cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" stands as a fine product in its genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, though I have to admit that I also enjoyed \\"Tarzan's Greatest Adventure\\" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role with his too perfect \\"all gymnasium\\" physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man).

Frank is delighted to discover that his next-door neighbour is Bob Mitchell, a friend from his days in the army. Frank finds employment in a travel agency run by another old army chum. As the children grow up and the country adapts to peacetime, the family attend a number of events, such as the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley in 1924. Reg becomes friendly with Sam, a staunch socialist, who is attracted to Vi. Queenie is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but she longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere. During the General Strike of 1926, Reg is injured in a brawl in Whitechapel Road. Vi blames Sam, who had brought her brother to the area, but eventually her anger dissipates and she marries him. In 1928, Charleston dance mania arrives in England; Queenie exhibits her fancy steps at the local dance hall and wins a dance contest. As all of London is swept up in the Jazz Age, news of new German chancellor Adolf Hitler begins to appear in the newspapers. Reg marries Phyllis. Billy proposes to Queenie, but she confesses she is in love with a married man and soon after runs off with him. Her mother says she cannot forgive her and never wants to see her again. As time passes, Aunt Sylvia discovers spiritualism, Reg and Phyllis are killed in a car crash, and the British Union of Fascists tries to stir up anti-Semitic sentiment in the city.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: When will the tax plan be made law?

Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. and a hint : All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness.

Here's a sentence in French, followed by its English translation: \\"Les feuilles des arbres changent de couleur à l'automne.\\" (The leaves of the trees change color in the fall.) This sentence illustrates a general observation about nature and the change of seasons. In French, the words \\"Les feuilles\\" refer to the leaves, \\"des arbres\\" to the trees, \\"changent de couleur\\" to change color, and \\"à l'automne\\" to in the fall. The sentence structure in French is quite similar to English, with the subject coming first, followed by the verb and then the object. The French language is a Romance language that developed from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. It is the official language of France and is spoken in many other countries around the world, including Canada, Belgium, and Switzerland. French is known for its rich history, extensive vocabulary, and artistic influences on literature and culture. It is also one of the official languages of the United Nations. The sentence provided demonstrates some basic French grammar rules, such as the use of determiners, subject-verb agreement, and prepositions. In particular, it shows that French, like many romance languages, tends to use more specific determiners in place of the more general determiners of English. For instance, it uses \\"Les\\" and \\"des\\" which are more specific to the particular objects in question, while English uses \\"the\\" and \\"of the,\\" respectively. Another aspect of French evident in the sentence is the use of subject-verb agreement. In French, verbs must agree in number and person with their subject. In this case, \\"changent\\" agrees with \\"Les feuilles,\\" which is plural. If the subject were singular, the verb would change to \\"change.\\" Finally, the sentence showcases the French use of prepositions. Just like in English, prepositions are used to indicate spatial relations between objects, such as \\"on,\\" \\"in,\\" or \\"at.\\" In this example, the preposition \\"à\\" is used to mark the time of the action (in the fall). In summary, the sentence \\"Les feuilles des arbres changent de couleur à l'automne\\" is a simple French sentence that highlights some fundamental aspects of the language, such as its vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. By understanding this sentence, you can also appreciate the similarities and differences between French and English, as well as some of the unique features of the French language."},{"question":"Does the word \\"time\\" mean the same thing in \\"He was a great actor in his time.\\" and \\"Time stops for nobody.\\"?","response":"No, the word \\"time\\" in these sentences has slightly different meanings. In the sentence, \\"He was a great actor in his time,\\" \\"time\\" refers to a specific period in the past when the actor was popular and successful. So, it tells us about when he was famous. In the sentence, \\"Time stops for nobody,\\" \\"time\\" means the ongoing flow of moments, seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on. In this case, it tells us that time keeps moving forward and doesn't pause for anyone. Although the word \\"time\\" is used in both sentences, it has slightly different meanings in each situation."},{"question":"Question: Article: For years people had told our founders, motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, inspiring stories about themselves.

I was at home in Chicago, still in high school, singing in church, living with my family.” She opens her bright brown eyes again, stares straight at me to answer my question. “But generally, no, it feels like another Jennifer life. I don’t look the same. I’m a mother now. So many things have changed. I sometimes think the only constant is my voice. That hasn’t gone away.” In those 15 years, Hudson has lived more than a few American dreams and nightmares. Having taken her chances at manufactured fame on Simon Cowell’s American Idol (she was a losing finalist in series 3) she discovered it for real with her unforgettable debut acting performance in Dreamgirls, in which she played spurned Motown diva Effie White, stealing the show from Beyoncé Knowles, Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx and winning a best supporting actress Oscar. She followed that with a Grammy award-winning album that saw her bracketed, naturally, with Aretha and Whitney. The talk then was that she had an old soul voice, a seen-it-all voice (the authentic sound of a “religious, transcendent experience” Oprah Winfrey said). As it turned out, she hadn’t seen anything yet. In October 2008, while on tour, Hudson received a call from her sister Julia that changed the narrative of her life forever. Hudson had been trying to reach her mother by text that morning and was worried that she did not get a reply (they contacted each other first thing every morning when she was on the road, so the silence was odd). The silence was explained by Julia’s hysterical call that told her their mother, Darnell, and brother, Jason, had been shot and murdered at home, and that Julia’s seven-year-old son, Julian, was missing. Hudson later recalled in the trial of her former brother-in-law, William Balfour, that she had gone straight back to Chicago and holed up with her sister in a hotel room, holding each other and waiting for news. After three days, Julian’s body was discovered in the back of a stolen pick-up truck. Balfour was eventually convicted of the three murders in 2012 and received three life sentences. Hudson is still finding ways to talk about those years. “I have definitely seen the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows,” she says. “You don’t know how strong you are until you are placed in that kind of moment.” She pauses. “I don’t really know what else to say.” Her mother had been the secretary of the local church, where Hudson had led the gospel solos in the choir. Was her religious faith a help to her? “It was the ultimate help to me,” she says. “We always said: ‘If He brings you to it, He will bring you through it.’ There would be no point in faith if it wasn’t tested. My mother always told me no matter how negative your life seems to be, you must always look for a positive. That is what I believe a woman of faith should do.” In hudson’s early years her father was mostly absent from the family and she shared a bed with her mother until she was 16. There is a kind of primal scream of human separation that her voice seems created for. It was there already in her extraordinary performance of Dreamgirls’s signature lament – “And I am telling you I’m not going” – and it is there throughout her second album, on tracks like “I Remember Me”. Her third album, JHUD, which is released in September, includes a song that she has written in her mother’s memory called “Moan”. The lyric runs: “My momma taught me everything I know, and I will take it everywhere I go, if you think you’ve seen it all, just keep on living, live long”. I imagine the act of singing that song has been very tough. “Yes,” she says, “but Mom would always tell us if you are hurting, moan and you will feel better. That’s the title of the song. There is not a day that goes by when I don’t repeat the things she said. She was very quiet. The complete opposite of us kids. Now she has gone, I realise she had a lot to say. My brother, too, I hear him, too. When we were kids any time my brother saw me crying he would be like, ‘Jenny, knock it off.’ And that’s what I hear him say when I cry now.” In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, Hudson was in something of a daze. She was in something like that state, too, she recalls, when she walked out at the Super Bowl in 2012 to sing “Star-Spangled Banner” beside the children of Sandy Hook High School who had lately suffered their own immeasurable loss. The performance came a few weeks after the long process of justice that culminated in the conviction of Balfour. “In many ways the trial was the most dreadful part of it all,” Hudson says. “But again I know my mother would not have wanted us to miss a beat, so we were there every day. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone to have to experience anything like that, but that is what you do for your family, so that is what we did…” What was in her head when she stepped out to sing the national anthem? “I was not very present at all any of that time,” she says. “It felt like a dream. I haven’t watched it back, because those moments send you back to a certain place and that’s a place I don’t want to go back to.” To avoid that constant return to grief, Hudson has worked on ways to live in the present and future. “That is where the Julian D King Foundation came from,” she says, of the charity created in her nephew’s name. “I was thinking how could I find something in all this that would make my mother proud of me. My sister and I lost three family members and we both wanted to find a way that we would not dread every birthday and holiday and family occasion again. I wanted my sister to celebrate Julian’s birthday again, so we created Hatch Day, where we go around together giving local schools supplies that they need. And she looks forward to shopping for that, like she used to look forward to shopping for his birthday presents. My nephew was super into education – he used to call himself Dr King. She can pour his blessings on to these kids and keep his memory alive.” It is often said of great soul singers that all the grief of the ages is embedded in their voices; have those awful experiences, I ask, changed the way she feels about her own vocal expression? She thinks for a moment. “No,” she says. “Certainly there is a lot of emotion there, but I think I have always been in that kind of space. What do they say in church? Sing from your heart, because you are singing to God. You know, when I used to sing those solos in church I would go through every line and ask the director: ‘What does this mean? What are we trying to convey here?’ If you can’t feel the emotion of a song, how do you expect anyone else to? It’s like a testimony in that way.” She believes that testimony has become more personal on her new album, which is more upbeat than her previous ballad-led work. “I think this album is more my personality coming through,” she says. She has been writing on some of the tracks and is involved in production, with the help of friends like Timbaland and R Kelly. “It’s been a completely different experience,” she says. “I’ve never stayed in the studio all night long, but this time I had a three-song set to do with Timbaland and we did all three songs in one night. I was writing, guiding my own vocals, just being creative. I never used to love going into the studio. Now I can’t wait to get there.” Writing is a new challenge, but the gift of singing has been with her as long as she can remember. When did she first realise she could communicate it? “When I was 13, 14. It was my other classmates or people in the choir who kind of made me realise,” she says. “They would say the adults listened differently when I sang. And that made me take notice. I started to go and sing at various places and all these people would show up – my teachers, people from church, friends. After that I would be making music videos in the mirror, practising my acceptance speeches. I would sing in the hallway of our home, where the acoustics were good, and neighbours would stop me next morning and say: ‘I heard you singing last night.’ The line was always the same: ‘She’s a little girl but she sounds like a grown woman…’” There had been a lot of music at home. Her grandmother, who lived with the family, had been a soloist in her time, and taught Jennifer and Julia (“though my sister is not a singer,” Hudson says of her elder sibling, with a rivalrous giggle. “Not at all! She’s hilarious!”) It was her mother who pointed her in the direction of American Idol. “The first series, I wasn’t so interested. It was summer, I wanted to be outside. But my mother was on at me: ‘You should watch this.’ To start with I was like, ‘Whatever’, but when Kelly Clarkson won the first series I was literally nauseous. I realised it could be for real. I was beating myself up that I didn’t go and audition. When season two came around I had started working for the Disney Cruise Line and that was a given, whereas Idol was a gamble. So I stuck with what I had. I used the ship experience to test myself. When I got off the ship two days later I went to audition for American Idol. That’s when the ball started rolling.” She must have been surprised not to win. “It was better to lose, in some ways. When I went to audition for Dreamgirls, I was still in that ‘I am not going to let anything stop me’ kind of mood.” Was it terrifying to turn up on the first day on set with Foxx and Murphy and Beyoncé, without a day’s acting experience? “It was like I had blinders on. I had no time to be scared. I didn’t really realise how important my character, Effie, was to the film until it finished, somehow. I just wanted to keep up, make sure I did my best.” That spirit seems to have been pretty near to the surface throughout Hudson’s life. There is something cheerfully indomitable about her, something you guess will never take no for an answer, and not just because you know what she has come through. When I ask her about her father she says that he wasn’t really present in her childhood, but when she was 14 she thought “enough was enough and went with my siblings to find him. And after that he was around for us until he passed. I was always one for having people get along. So I was a bit like: ‘Let’s go and get Dad and tell him we are all going to live together’ and after that we did. It was kind of weird.” In 2010 Hudson dramatically changed her appearance, losing 4st and becoming a face of Weight Watchers. I ask if that change in body shape has further changed her sense of self. “I have a lot more fun with clothes and shopping these days,” she says. “But as far as sense of self I have always had a lot of confidence. There were several reasons for it. One was preparing for an acting role. The other was that my fiancé [WWE wrestler-turned-lawyer David Otunga] and I realised that when we were growing up neither one of us had good health examples. We were always told to finish your food, clear your plate. We were never taught the proper way to eat. We grew up around a lot of eating, fish fries on Fridays, all that. When I was ready to have my son we wanted to teach him right. It was not until I went to Hollywood that I realised people might watch what they eat. I was like, ‘Wow!’ And then I thought ‘OK, I can do that.’” Have people treated her differently? “Definitely. People I knew 10 years ago, 50lb ago, will be really strange around me. I have to remind them it is me, Jennifer, honestly.” The birth of Hudson’s son, David Jnr, in 2009, followed quite closely on the tragedy and presented her with a new set of challenges, as well as an ever-present antidote to her grief. She has travelled to London alone when we meet but hates to be away from him. “He’s nearly five, a big boy now at home with his dad. He will click his fingers when I leave and say, ‘Mum you will be home this quick?’ He’s into superheroes, so I tell him I’m going to fly away like Superman and do my work and fly right back to him. Which works for a while…” One of the things her experience of being a daughter and mother have taught her is that maybe there are more things to sing about than the songs that tend to come her way. She once expressed her regret, at 30-something, about still being expected to sing exclusively about clubland chemistry. I wonder how strongly she feels that. “Something I said got a bit exaggerated,” she says, “but there are an awful lot of songs about sex, and it’s more like, as I say to my sister Julia sometimes, does everything have to be about that one thing? The world is a broad place. Even on my first album I was like, ‘Isn’t there more to sing about in the world? Or to talk about? There is so much more out there to portray…’” As she talks, she uses her sister, with whom she has been through so much, as a kind of touchstone, or ever-present confidante. “We have always been very close,” she says. “She works with me now – although she doesn’t do all that much work! She bosses me around, she’s a tough cookie. We don’t live together or anything, she likes being Julia and I like being Jennifer, but she never stops being my big sister. It’s like, ‘Jennifer go get this!’ and I’m like, ‘Hey, I’m the boss!’” That mixture of tenderness and stubborn will seems ever present in Hudson’s voice. When she was making JHUD her more assertive alter ego was christened with a name – Jones – the part of her that, however broken or vulnerable, is always ready to take on the world. Where, I ask, before our time is up, did that moniker come from? “It came from doing the shoot for the album,” she says. “The image was coming together photo by photo, but I’d look at it and think: ‘Who is that? It’s not me!’ It took on a whole other persona. It looked more like Grace Jones. Since then I call her Jones, ‘boss lady’, she’s always around.” Hudson laughs. “I don’t think she’s going away any time soon.” Jennifer Hudson’s latest single, Walk It Out, is out now. The new album is released later this year Write a title for it.","response":"Jennifer Hudson: Reflecting on Her Life, Tragedies, and Career"},{"question":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sutcliffe was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services. In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence. In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test.

Reached a new level of frequent flyer miles Answer:","response":"Title: Milestone Plot Summary: Ryan, a dedicated businessman, becomes an unexpected hero when he reaches an extraordinary level of frequent flyer miles during his flight home, uncovering a dangerous criminal plot that threatens to bring down the entire flight. Act 1: Ryan Thompson, a hardworking businessman in his late 30s, has been traveling the world to maintain his company's international connections. As a persistent workaholic, he is always away from his family and has rarely spent quality time with his wife and teenage son. His devotion to his work has made him clock up numerous frequent flyer miles as he flies from city to city. On his latest business trip, Ryan's flight gets unexpectedly delayed. While he doesn't really like the disruption, the delay gives him the time to reflect on his life choices and priorities. He begins to have regrets about all the special family moments he missed and decides that, once he reaches home, he will do better and prioritize family. Act 2: At last, Ryan boards the flight that will take him back home. As the plane reaches cruising altitude, the flight crew announces that Ryan has achieved an unprecedented level of frequent flyer miles, and he's been given complimentary access to the luxury cabin area as a gesture of appreciation. Despite feeling uneasy by the sudden attention from the crew and fellow passengers, he proceeds to enjoy the offered upgrade. As the journey progresses, Ryan becomes more inquisitive and observant. He starts to converse with the flight attendants and gets to know them better. Ryan overhears some passengers, who claim to be affiliated with the airline, discussing confidential details which sound suspicious. Tapping into his business acumen and strong instincts, Ryan realizes that the individuals have sinister intentions, possibly hijacking the aircraft or blowing the plane up. Act 3: Ryan recalls noticing a nervous fellow passenger on his previous flights, who despite his initial suspicions had always been seemingly harmless. With his newly reached milestone and unique boarding sequence, he concludes that this man, Mr. Eric Stoneman, is a potential threat. In an effort to foil the impending disaster, Ryan begins to form alliances with the crew members and some passengers who previously celebrated his achievement. Under the cover of congratulatory conversations, Ryan shares his suspicions and devises a plan to take down the criminals. Act 4: As Ryan and the group execute their improvised plan, they discover that Mr. Stoneman's cohorts have taken control of the plane's communication systems and cockpit. The situation becomes dire, as the ticking time bomb nestled within the luggage compartment cannot be easily detected or defused due to the intricacy of the criminals’ designs. With his wits and leadership skills, Ryan manages to turn the tables, successfully subduing the perpetrators and restoring communication with ground control. A skilled technician passenger offers to help in locating and defusing the bomb as air traffic control and Ryan work in tandem to guide the plane back to safety. Act 5: The plane makes an emergency landing as authorities swarm the aircraft, capturing the thwarted criminals. Ryan's courage and quick-thinking save the passengers, crew, and his own life. Media lauds him as an unsuspecting hero, and he reunites with his family, promising to cherish every moment with them from this point forward. The movie ends with Ryan, now more family-focused, joining his wife and son on a long overdue family vacation. He's determined to strike the balance between his thriving business and prioritizing family time, while also sparingly using his earned frequent flyer miles as a reminder of the life-changing journey that brought him closer to his loved ones."},{"question":"Given the question: Process: - Put water in an ice cube tray - Put the ice cube tray in the freezer - Wait 5 to 6 hours - Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer - Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The machine is working at optimal performance happens, how will it affect put water filled ice trays into the freezer. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of \\"The machine is working at optimal performance\\" has an indirect effect on the process of putting water-filled ice trays into the freezer. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Put water in an ice cube tray: The perturbation has no direct effect on this step, but it could be argued that having the machine work at optimal performance leads to better availability of cold water, which might slightly affect the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze. 2. Put the ice cube tray in the freezer: If the machine (refrigerator/freezer) is working at optimal performance, this means that the freezer is maintaining the desired temperature consistently and efficiently. As a result, the freezing process will be more effective and could potentially reduce the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze. 3. Wait 5 to 6 hours: With the machine working at optimal performance, it is likely that the time it takes for the ice cubes to freeze might be reduced. So the waiting time might be affected slightly depending on the specific performance of the machine. 4. Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer: The perturbation doesn't have a direct effect on this step, as taking the ice cube tray out is a manual action irrespective of the performance of the machine. 5. Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink: The perturbation doesn't have a direct effect on this step either. However, because the machine is working at optimal performance, it could ensure that the ice cubes are uniformly frozen, making the release of the cubes from the tray a bit easier. Overall, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process, mainly influencing the freezing time and potentially the ease of releasing the cubes from the tray."},{"question":"Select your answer from the options.

While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \\"bindi\\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom. What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition? A) To pay respect to God. B) To stay in harmony with nature. C) To see things with a subjective view. D) To observe the outside world more clearly.

I found the following answer on Google: However, the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","response":"No, the information you found does not directly answer your question about which form of decay does not change the atomic number of the decaying atom. The correct answer to your question is that beta decay, specifically beta-plus decay (positron emission) and electron capture, does not change the atomic number. In beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron (beta particle) is emitted. This increases the atomic number by 1. However, in beta-plus decay (positron emission), a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron (antiparticle of the electron) is emitted. In electron capture, a proton in the nucleus captures an electron from an inner shell of the atom, converting the proton into a neutron. In both cases, the atomic number decreases by 1. The statement you found about the chance of decay being constant over time refers to the probability that a given radioactive atom will decay over time, which is a separate concept."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given books product reviews in Japanese language.

In order to determine this, it is important to analyze the premise and hypothesis individually and in relation to each other. The premise states that even when Realpolitik led the United States to side with dictators and oppressors, it was in the service of maximizing democracy and human rights in the world at large, with the ultimate goal being achieved. This premise focuses on the intent and outcomes of Realpolitik in terms of promoting democracy and human rights. The actions brought on by Realpolitik may have had various motivations and strategies, which might have included siding with dictators or oppressors for the greater good as described in the premise. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that Realpolitik encouraged people to side with dictators through an elaborate ad campaign. This statement provides a very specific and narrow approach to how Realpolitik may have influenced people's opinions and alliances. This hypothesis seems unrelated to the overall goal of promoting democracy and human rights mentioned in the premise. To establish a link between the truth of the premise and the truth of the hypothesis, it would be necessary for the hypothesis to logically follow from or be supported by the premise. In this case, there is no clear connection between them. The premise focuses on the overall intentions and outcomes of Realpolitik in terms of democracy and human rights, whereas the hypothesis describes a very specific method - an ad campaign - for encouraging people to side with dictators. This method is not mentioned or implied by the premise, so it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.\\" Answer: A:","response":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) offers a multitude of benefits to the brain, playing a vital role in maintaining optimal brain function and overall neurological health. In the context of studying brain damage and diseases, the BBB serves as a protective shield, safeguarding the brain from various threats. Here are some key benefits of the blood-brain barrier: 1. Selective permeability: The blood-brain barrier acts as a highly selective filter, allowing only essential nutrients and oxygen to pass through to the brain while preventing harmful substances from entering. This selective permeability is crucial for maintaining homeostasis within the brain and preserving optimal neuronal functioning. 2. Protection from toxins and pathogens: The BBB serves as a barrier to potentially toxic substances like heavy metals and drugs, as well as pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. By preventing these harmful agents from invading the brain, the BBB helps minimize damage to sensitive neural tissue and aids in maintaining overall brain health. 3. Preservation of the brain's microenvironment: The unique structure and function of the blood-brain barrier help maintain the brain's extracellular environment, ensuring stable pH, ion concentrations, and nutrient levels. This regulated environment contributes to proper neuronal signaling and synaptic transmission, which are fundamental to cognitive processes and overall brain function. 4. Regulation of immune response: The blood-brain barrier also plays a role in immune system activity within the central nervous system (CNS). While it restricts the entry of most immune cells, it allows certain immune cells to enter the brain and respond to infections or inflammation. This selective process helps maintain the balance between a necessary immune response and the potential for damage due to excessive inflammation. 5. Minimizing damage during brain injury: In the case of brain damage or injury, such as a stroke, the blood-brain barrier can sometimes provide additional protection, aiding in reducing the spread of damage within the brain tissue. While the nature of the damage may still be difficult to control or interpret, the BBB plays a crucial role in mitigating additional harm by restricting the entrance of damaging substances into the brain. Despite these benefits, it is essential to recognize that the blood-brain barrier can sometimes be compromised due to disease, injury, or aging. When this occurs, the brain becomes more susceptible to damage and dysfunction. Understanding the role of the BBB in protecting the brain and maintaining proper function is vital in both appreciating its importance and guiding potential therapies for brain disorders and injuries."},{"question":"Read this article and answer this question According to the 2011 National Household Survey, 89.3% of Markhams residents are Canadian citizens, and about 14.5% of residents are recent immigrants (from 2001 to 2011).

John was cleaning up and found pics from his trip to California in something old. What did he probablt find them in? Options: - suitcase - television - attic - fridge - newspaper","response":"To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and evaluate the likelihood of finding old pictures from a trip to California based on the context provided. 1. Suitcase: A suitcase is often used for traveling and may have been used during John's trip to California. It is possible that he kept the pictures in the suitcase and while cleaning up, he discovered them. This is a plausible option. 2. Television: Televisions don't typically store physical pictures. They are used to display visual content, and it is unlikely that John would have stored his pictures inside or on top of a television. This option can be ruled out. 3. Attic: An attic is a common place to store old belongings and memorabilia. It is possible that John stored the pictures from his trip to California in the attic and rediscovered them while cleaning. This is another plausible option. 4. Fridge: A fridge is not a typical place to store pictures, as it is specifically designed to store and preserve food. It is unlikely that John would have stored his pictures from the trip to California in the fridge. This option can be ruled out. 5. Newspaper: Newspapers are used to convey news and are not generally used to store personal belongings. It is unlikely that John would have stored the pictures from his trip to California in a newspaper. This option can be ruled out. Based on the step-by-step reasoning process, the two most plausible options are the \\"suitcase\\" and the \\"attic.\\" Since we are asked to provide a probable answer, we can choose the option that is more likely to store important personal belongings and forgotten items. Conclusion: John probably found the pictures from his trip to California in the \\"attic\\" since it is a more common place to store and forget old belongings compared to a suitcase."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: I'll start again.","response":"I'll start again: Začnu znovu. Step 1: Identify the words and their meanings: - 'I'll' is a contraction of 'I' (first-person pronoun) and 'will' (auxiliary verb, indicating intention or future action) - 'start' (verb) means to begin - 'again' (adverb) means to repeat an action Step 2: Find the corresponding Czech words: - 'I will': (já) budu - 'start': začít (infinitive form) - 'again': znovu Step 3: Combine words and adjust grammar: In Czech, the pronoun 'já' is often omitted, since the verb form already indicates the subject.

Maisy is confident that she will exceed her quota and decides to include this when calculating her wage at the new job. How much more money, in dollars, will Maisy earn at her new job? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Calculate Maisy's current job earnings At her current job, Maisy works 8 hours a week and earns 10 per hour. Current job weekly earnings = Hours per week * Wage per hour = 8 * 10 = 80 per week Step 2: Calculate Maisy's new job earnings if she exceeds her quota At her new job, Maisy works 4 hours a week and earns 15 per hour. She also receives an additional 35 bonus for exceeding her quota.

Foster) cases a local payroll delivery van for a holdup he takes into account the schedule of Rolfe and his deliveries as he plans his getaway. Foster contacts three crooks to help with the crime while keeping his own identity secret he blackmails them with past crimes and a guarantee of a 300 thousand-dollar payout for each. Pulling in Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand), and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef), Foster pulls off a robbery of a bank next to one of Rolfe's deliveries and then by using a duplicate flower van points the police to Rolfe who is arrested and brutally interrogated by the police. Eventually cleared Rolfe is determined to clear his name and sets out to find the crew that set him up. He tracks Harris to a gambling joint in Mexico and takes on his identity and travels to a resort town in Tijuana to confront the rest of the crooks. Once there he meets Foster's daughter Helen (Coleen Gray) who has come to surprise her father. Rolfe and Helen develop an immediate attraction for each other and Foster attempts to keep them apart, as he plans to frame Rolfe for the bank job.

My question: How does Foster get crooks to participate? A:","response":"Foster gets the crooks to participate in the heist by using both the promise of a substantial financial reward and blackmail. He gathers information on the past crimes of Peter Harris, Boyd Kane, and Tony Romano, which he uses as leverage to coerce them into helping him pull off the robbery. By promising each of them a 300,000 payout, Foster appeals to their greed and desire for a big payday. He ensures their loyalty and compliance by keeping his own identity a secret, thus maintaining an air of mystery and power over the crooks. This anonymity allows him to control and manipulate the situation from behind the scenes, minimizing the risk of betrayal or being caught. Foster's approach to recruiting the crooks is strategic and calculated, as he targets individuals with specific skills and past criminal experience necessary for the success of the heist. By exploiting their histories and using the potential for a significant financial gain, he is able to convince them to work together as a team to execute the robbery of the bank and the framing of innocent Joe Rolfe. The combination of these factors—blackmail, anonymity, and a sizeable payout—positions Foster as an authoritative and cunning figure that the three crooks find difficult to resist or challenge. As a result, they agree to participate in Foster's plan, setting the stage for the events that unfold throughout Kansas City Confidential."},{"question":"If For years Lisbon has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet town, without the hustle, bustle, and general hassle of other major European cities., can we conclude that \\"The town of Truro in Cornwall has more hustle and bustle than Lisbon.\\"? Available options: [+] yes [+] it is not possible to tell [+] no","response":"It is not possible to tell if the town of Truro in Cornwall has more hustle and bustle than Lisbon solely based on the information provided. While we understand that Lisbon has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet town compared to other major European cities, this statement does not give us a definitive comparison with the town of Truro in Cornwall. To make a fair comparison, we would need more context and data about both places, not just an idea about the reputation of one city. Factors such as population, tourism rates, infrastructure, commercial and business activities, and transportation systems would all be essential in determining the level of hustle and bustle in both Lisbon and Truro. Lisbon, as the capital of Portugal, is a major city with a rich cultural heritage and vibrant tourism, while Truro, in Cornwall, is a smaller town known for its historical sites and picturesque landscape. Without additional information about the day-to-day life in both locations (e.g., footfall in city centers, traffic congestion, or cultural events), we cannot definitively determine which place has a higher level of hustle and bustle. Moreover, comparing Lisbon and Truro might not result in a fair evaluation, given their different characteristics and sizes. While Lisbon has a population of approximately 505,000 people, Truro's population is significantly smaller at around 18,000. Population-wise, one could assume that Lisbon might have more hustle and bustle. However, the hustle and bustle of a town or city are subjective concepts that may vary according to the individual’s perceptions and experiences. Some people might find a smaller town to be more bustling, while others would base their evaluation on the available recreational activities and social opportunities. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine whether the town of Truro in Cornwall has more hustle and bustle than Lisbon without additional information and contextual knowledge about both places. If provided with more data, we can make a better comparison or perhaps even determine the specific aspects that give each location its unique vibe and level of activity, which may better inform an individual's judgment."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Carol for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle. - Tristan da Cunha, colloquially Tristan, is the name of both a remote group of volcanic islands in the south Atlantic Ocean and the main island of that group. It is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, lying from the nearest inhabited land, Saint Helena, and from the nearest continental land, South Africa. It is from South America. The territory consists of the main island, named Tristan da Cunha, which has a northsouth length of and an area of , along with the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands and the wildlife reserves of Inaccessible and Gough islands. As of January 2017, the main island has 262 permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, the other islands are uninhabited, except for the personnel of a weather station on Gough Island. - Queen Mary 's Peak is the summit of the island of Tristan da Cunha , in the South Atlantic Ocean . It has an elevation of 2,062 metres ( 6,765 ft ) above sea level . It is named after Mary of Teck , the Queen consort of King George V. It is the highest point of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena , Ascension and Tristan da Cunha . The mountain is the peak of the massive shield volcano which forms the island . A 300 m ( 1,000 ft ) wide summit crater caps the peak , and it contains a heart - shaped crater lake . This lake is normally frozen during the winter , and the upper slopes of the volcano are covered in snow . The only recorded historical eruption occurred in 1961 from a vent on the north shore of the island . The island community had to be evacuated . Queen Mary 's Peak was used by sailors on the route from Europe to the Indian Ocean and beyond as a navigational aid . In the 17th century the East India Company instructed captains to sail via Tristan . In 2004 , Ellen MacArthur sighted the Peak on her record - breaking circumnavigation of the world . - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Mary of Teck (Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes; 26 May 1867 24 March 1953) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Empress of India as the wife of King-Emperor George V. - Saint Helena is a volcanic tropical island in the South Atlantic Ocean, east of Rio de Janeiro and west of the Cunene River, which marks the border between Namibia and Angola in southwestern Africa. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about and has a population of 4,534 (2016 census). It was named after Saint Helena of Constantinople. - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. - Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory located in the South Atlantic and consisting of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\". - Bulgaria (tr. '), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (tr. '), is a country in southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. With a territory of , Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.

A:","response":"The answer to the question \\"Which happened later, the single-grain experiment or the discovery that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice?\\" is the single-grain experiment. In the provided text, we learn about various scientific advancements related to nutrition and animal well-being in the early 20th century. The text mentions that in 1906, Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but did not assure their growth. However, it was in 1907 when Stephen M. Babcock and Edwin B. Hart conducted the single-grain experiment, which took nearly four years to complete. From this information, we can conclude that the single-grain experiment happened later than the discovery of the role of tryptophan in mice well-being. The single-grain experiment took place in 1907 and continued for almost four years, while the tryptophan discovery occurred in 1906. The single-grain experiment was a significant breakthrough in the field of nutrition, as it demonstrated the importance of various nutrients in the diet for proper health and growth. Similarly, the discovery of tryptophan's role in the well-being of mice shed light on the role of amino acids and other dietetic factors in animal health. Both of these experiments were crucial in advancing our understanding of nutrition and the dietary requirements of animals, including humans."},{"question":"Briefly summarize this sentence: a bronx lawyer who was once an assistant district attorney was sentenced to eight months in federal prison tuesday for bribing and threatening witnesses in several murder and kidnapping cases three years ago .","response":"A former assistant district attorney and Bronx lawyer received an eight-month federal prison sentence on Tuesday for his involvement in witness bribery and intimidation incidents related to multiple murder and kidnapping cases that occurred approximately three years ago."},{"question":"How do women feel when they get very horny?

The first question is about the sensations that women experience when they are very horny. The second question relates to whether women in big cities such as New York notice and/or feel attraction to men they see on the street. Answer the first question by explaining the general experience of women when they are very horny. Begin by mentioning the physiological changes that occur when a woman becomes aroused, such as increased blood flow to the genital area, vaginal lubrication, and the swelling of the clitoris and labia. Then, discuss the emotional and psychological aspects, which can include intense desire for sexual activity, increased sensitivity to touch, and potentially feelings of frustration or restlessness. Answer the second question by pointing out that attraction varies from person to person, and therefore, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer for all women in big cities. However, some women may notice and feel attracted to men on the street depending on various factors such as personal preferences, current emotional state, and context. Highlight the importance of confidence, approachability, and individuality as factors that may contribute to being noticed by women. Finally, reaffirm that the two questions asked are different from each other. The first question focuses on the personal experience of arousal, while the second question concerns the factors that may influence whether women notice and feel attracted to men in public spaces."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently in the production of gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation.

As Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of \\"changing\\" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie.

To provide better context and comprehension, it is important to understand the background of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict is an ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians, primarily revolving around issues such as borders, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem. It has deep roots in history, nationality, and religion, with both parties having claims to the land and holy sites. The conflict has led to several wars, uprisings, and continuous violence since the mid-20th century. Ariel Sharon, a prominent Israeli military and political leader, served as Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006. Sharon was known for his tenacious and combative approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Sharon implemented a number of strategies and policies to address the ongoing conflict. In 2004-2005, he endorsed a plan known as the Gaza Disengagement, which entailed the withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip. The situation mentioned in the topic appears to be related to an Israeli military offensive in Gaza during Sharon's tenure. The offensive, reportedly the largest in four years, resulted in the deaths of 100 Palestinians. In light of this situation, Sharon provided approval for Israeli troops to withdraw from parts of Northern Gaza. Such a decision could be indicative of a strategic move, an attempt to lessen international condemnation, or a response to internal political pressures. The withdrawal, however, is unlikely to signify an end to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It is important to keep in mind that the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute lends itself to multiple interpretations and potential implications. In analyzing this topic, it is crucial to consider the broader perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the role of Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister. The withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Northern Gaza may reflect a temporary de-escalation, but it does not guarantee a lasting resolution. To achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace, both parties must engage in dialogue and negotiations to address the root issues of the conflict. This would require compromise, trust-building, and, ultimately, a commitment to a shared vision for the future of the region."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who marched with Besant? ? Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.

Here's a step-by-step example of creating such a task: 1. Identify a topic: Choose a topic that involves physical principles, such as mechanics, thermodynamics, or electromagnetism. For this example, let's pick mechanics. 2. Determine complexity: Decide on the difficulty level of the task, whether it's suitable for beginners or advanced learners. Let's create a task that is suitable for someone who has a basic understanding of mechanics. 3. Develop a scenario: Create a real-world scenario to contextualize the task, making it more engaging and relatable. In this case, we could use a scenario involving a sled on a frictionless slope. 4. Formulate the problem: Define a clear and specific problem that requires the application of physical reasoning to solve. For our scenario, the problem could be to determine the acceleration of the sled as it slides down the slope and the time it takes to reach the bottom of the slope. 5. Require explanation: To ensure the user demonstrates their physical reasoning, ask them to explain their thought process and justify the steps they took to solve the problem. So, the complete task could be: \\"A sled with a mass of 30 kg is placed at the top of a frictionless slope that is 45° inclined and 15 meters long.

In the latter category, it competes with Ben Affleck's thriller Argo and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, both of which have five nominations. The winners will be announced in Los Angeles on 13 January, 2013. There are also nominations for three British Dames - Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, as well as TV nods to Downton Abbey, The Hour and Sherlock. In the drama actor category, British star Day-Lewis is shortlisted alongside Richard Gere, John Hawkes, Denzel Washington and Joaquin Phoenix, for The Master. Phoenix shared the best actor prize with his co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman at the recent Venice Film Festival, but the elder actor has been demoted to the supporting actor category at the Globes. Tom Hooper 'proud' of Globes nominations Nominations for best actress are led by Jessica Chastain, who plays a CIA agent on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty. She is joined on the shortlist by Marion Cotillard, Naomi Watts and British stars Rachel Weisz and Dame Helen Mirren, who stars in Hitchcock, which documents the making of Psycho. The film adaptation of stage hit Les Miserables, by British director Tom Hooper, has four nominations. It is in the running for best film - musical or comedy, while stars Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway both get acting nods. Hooper, who won an Oscar for The King's Speech in 2010, told the BBC the nominations were a \\"testament\\" to the film's production crew, \\"who were largely London-based\\". \\"It's a great moment for the industry there,\\" he added. However, Hooper himself missed out on the shortlist for best director. Instead, Ben Affleck, Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow and Ang Lee - who filmed the \\"unfilmable\\" novel Life Of Pi - all made the cut. This is the first time Affleck has been named in the category, but his counterparts are all former nominees, with Lee and Spielberg going on to win twice. Voted for by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes are an important precursor to the Oscars. Last year's winners included Meryl Streep, Octavia Spencer, Jean Dujardin and Christopher Plummer - all of whom went on to receive Academy Awards in the main acting categories. One notable difference of opinion in recent years came over The Hurt Locker. The Globes overlooked Kathryn Bigelow in the best director category, giving the prize to her former husband, James Cameron, for Avatar. A month later, the decision was reversed at the Oscars, where Bigelow became the first woman ever to win the best director award. Darker tones Another of the big differences between the two ceremonies is the spilt between \\"drama\\" and \\"musical or comedy\\" in the main categories, meaning the Globes can lavish praise on lighter films which may miss out at the Oscars. The category has darker tones this year, however, with the inclusion of Les Miserables and Silver Linings Playbook, a comedy with a strong focus on mental health problems. On the other hand, romantic drama Salmon Fishing In The Yemen unexpectedly received three nominations in the category, with British stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt up for best actor and actress. Another British contender is pop star Adele, nominated for best original song for her title track from the Bond film Skyfall. She is up against Suddenly from Les Miserables, as well as songs from The Hunger Games, Act of Valor and Stand Up Guys, which features a song from Bon Jovi. In the foreign language category, Amour - the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes - is up against A Royal Affair from Denmark, Untouchable from France, Rust & Bone and Kon-Tiki. By Helen O'HaraEmpire magazine The Golden Globes are overstated as an Oscar predictor. I don't think separating drama from comedy and musicals is that useful in a year where you have a very strong musical. Les Miserables feels like the most traditional best picture winner at the Oscars, but the Globes put it in the musical category, so you can't tell whether it could beat Lincoln, Life of Pi or Argo at the Oscars. In terms of best actor, I think if Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't get it, then there is something wrong with the world. Jessica Chastain should win best actress because she is terrific in Zero Dark Thirty. It's interesting not to see The Hobbit anywhere there which I think people will be disappointed by. I think in the Oscars, too, it is going to do better in the technical categories. The Golden Globes also recognises achievements in television and there are some notable successes for British shows and actors. Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery is nominated for best actress in a TV miniseries, while her co-star Dame Maggie Smith is nominated in the supporting actress category. \\"This continued run of success for Downton in the US awards demonstrates the affection for the show in America and shows that British writing, acting and production can match the very best of Hollywood,\\" said the show's executive producer Gareth Neame. BBC One newsroom drama The Hour, comedy series Episodes - starring Friends actor Matt Le Blanc - and Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes are all in the running for prizes. Damian Lewis, the British-born star of Homeland is up against Boardwalk Empire's Steve Buscemi in the shortlist for best actor in a TV drama. Hosting duo Amanda Nevill, CEO of the British Film Institute, said: \\"With nominations for British films and talent spread across so many categories at this year's Golden Globes, the UK's world class film industry, talent and skills are once again in the global spotlight.\\" Claire Danes is up for best actress for Homeland, having won the award last year. But the winner of the best actor last year, Kelsey Grammar saw his show Boss cancelled after series two. Also nominated are Bryan Cranston, Jeff Daniels and Mad Men's John Hamm. After being hosted for three years by Ricky Gervais, this year's Golden Globes will be hosted by comedy actresses Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Both are up for the TV comedy actress prize, for their shows Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock. It has already been announced that Silence of the Lambs actress Jodie Foster will receive the Cecil B DeMille Award for lifetime achievement at January's event, held in the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

It is pitched in E, and is smaller than the tenor, but larger than the soprano. The alto sax is the most common saxophone and is commonly used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, and solo repertoire), military bands, marching bands, and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, swing music). The alto saxophone was also commonplace in popular music from the 1980s and early 1990s with the saxophone solo at the bridge of the song. The saxophone fingerings are all universal, so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone. - Alfred McCoy Tyner (born December 11, 1938) is a jazz pianist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, known for his work with the John Coltrane Quartet and a long solo career. - Wayne Shorter (born August 25, 1933) is an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Many of Shorter's compositions have become jazz standards, and his output has earned worldwide recognition, critical praise and various commendations, including 10 Grammy Awards. He has also received acclaim for his mastery of the soprano saxophone (after switching his focus from the tenor in the late 1960s), beginning an extended reign in 1970 as \\"Down Beat's\\" annual poll-winner on that instrument, winning the critics' poll for 10 consecutive years and the readers' for 18. The \\"New York Times\\" has described Shorter as \\"probably jazz's greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living improviser.\\" - Sonny Greenwich , CM ( born January 1 , 1936 ) is a Canadian guitarist .

He has performed with such ' greats ' as Charles Lloyd , Wayne Shorter , Pharoah Sanders , McCoy Tyner , Chick Corea , John Handy and Sun Ra . - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\".

It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a \\"clarinetist\\" (sometimes spelled \\"clarinettist\\"). - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - John William Coltrane, also known as \\"Trane\\" (September 23, 1926 July 17, 1967), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. - Legal name is the name that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate (see \\"birth name\\"), but may change subsequently. Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes their first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations). - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.

It is an acoustical wooden guitar with strings made of nylon, rather than the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. The traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the soundhole (this is called the classical position). The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see Dreadnought) and is commonly played off the hip. - Midtown Manhattan, or Midtown, represents the central lengthwise portion of the borough and island of Manhattan in New York City. Midtown is home to some of the city's most iconic buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the headquarters of the United Nations, and it contains world-renowned commercial zones such as Rockefeller Center, Broadway, and Times Square. Along Manhattan's north-south long axis, Midtown Manhattan separates Lower Manhattan from Upper Manhattan. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - The soprano saxophone is a higher-register variety of the saxophone, a woodwind instrument, invented in the 1840s. The soprano is the third smallest member of the saxophone family, which consists (from smallest to largest) of the soprillo, sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass, contrabass saxophone and tubax. - Ra (\\"R\\") or Re (\\"R\\") is the ancient Egyptian sun god.

It is the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use, and uses a mouthpiece, reed, and ligature that are larger than the tenor, alto and soprano saxophones, the other commonly found members of the family. The baritone saxophone is commonly used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music and solo repertoire), military bands, marching bands and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, etc.). - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - Carnegie Hall (also frequently or ) is a concert venue in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, United States, located at 881 Seventh Avenue, occupying the east side of Seventh Avenue between West 56th Street and West 57th Street, two blocks south of Central Park. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar.

The question and answer pair are described below.","response":"Question: Can a customer be dining and playing golf at the same time? Answer: No, a customer cannot be dining and playing golf at the same time. Step-by-step justification: 1. Dining typically involves sitting at a table, consuming food, and engaging in conversation. It is an activity focused on eating and socializing. 2. Golf, on the other hand, is an outdoor sport that requires physical movement, concentration, and skill. It involves hitting a golf ball with a club and maneuvering it through a course with various obstacles and terrain. 3. The two activities require different levels of physical movement and concentration. Dining is generally a passive activity that allows for conversation, while golf requires constant movement, focus, and interaction with the environment. 4. Combining the two activities would be challenging, as one would need to balance the physical requirements of golf with the social and dietary obligation of dining. Attempting to do both simultaneously would likely result in a poor experience for both activities, detracting from the enjoyment and effectiveness of each. 5. Furthermore, the setting of each activity is distinctly different. Dining typically takes place in a restaurant, cafe, or similar venue, whereas golf is played on a golf course. The two venues are often not designed to accommodate the other activity. In conclusion, a customer cannot be dining and playing golf at the same time due to the differences in physical requirements, concentration, setting, and overall experience associated with each activity."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given dvd product reviews in French language.

Choices: - exhaustion - shortness of breath - heart attacks - blisters - diabetes The rationale to choose \\"heart attacks\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"Too much jogging for elderly people can lead to heart attacks. The rationale for choosing \\"heart attacks\\" as the answer is based on the following factors: 1. Age-related physical changes: As people age, their cardiovascular system undergoes changes that can increase the risk of heart attacks. These changes include a decrease in the elasticity of blood vessels, the heart muscle becoming less efficient, and a reduction in oxygen supply to the heart due to narrowing of the arteries. 2. Overexertion: Engaging in excessive or strenuous physical activity, such as jogging, can cause the heart to work harder than it can safely handle, especially in older individuals who may have pre-existing heart conditions or weakened cardiovascular systems. This overexertion can lead to a heart attack. 3. Pre-existing health conditions: Elderly people are more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, which can increase the risk of a heart attack during strenuous exercise. 4. Lack of proper conditioning: Older adults who engage in excessive jogging without adequate conditioning and preparation may strain their hearts, putting themselves at greater risk for a heart attack. While the other choices mentioned - exhaustion, shortness of breath, blisters, and diabetes - can also be related to excessive jogging in elderly individuals, heart attacks stand out as a more severe and potentially life-threatening consequence in this context. However, it's important to note that engaging in regular, moderate exercise is generally beneficial for older adults, as it can improve cardiovascular fitness, help control chronic health conditions, and enhance overall well-being."},{"question":"Use evidence from the fact that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"A ruler is used for measuring the length of what?\\" Available choices: (A). distance between cities (B). air (C). stuff (D). motivation","response":"A ruler is a measuring tool typically made of various materials such as wood, plastic, or metal, and is used for measuring length or distances. It consists of a linear scale marked with units like centimeters, millimeters, or inches. Using the evidence that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object, we can analyze each of the available choices and determine the most appropriate answer: (A) Distance between cities: Rulers are not suitable for measuring extensive distances like the distance between cities. Such large distances are typically measured in units like kilometers or miles. While a ruler can be useful for calculating such distances on a map with a specific scale, it is not practical to use a ruler directly to measure the distance between cities in real-world conditions. (B) Air: Air is a mixture of gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere. It does not have a specific measureable length, as it is composed of individual molecules that occupy space in a non-linear manner. As such, a ruler would not be an appropriate tool for measuring air. (C) Stuff: This option is broad and vague. A ruler can be used to measure the length of various 'stuff' or objects that have linear dimensions such as notebooks, fabric, or wood. Since this choice aligns with the evidence – that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object – this is the most appropriate answer based on the information provided. (D) Motivation: Motivation is a psychological and emotional state and does not have a physical length or dimensional attribute. A ruler cannot measure motivation, as it is not a tangible concept. In conclusion, based on the evidence that a ruler is used for measuring the length of an object, the best-suited answer among the available choices would be (C) stuff. It is important to note, however, that the term \\"stuff\\" could be more precisely defined to better reflect specific types of objects that can be measured with a ruler."},{"question":"Eylül ayında İttifak, aralarında deniz gözetimi, istihbarat paylaşımı, sivil acil durum planlaması ve potansiyel kitle imha silahlı saldırılarla başa çıkacak özel bir birliğin görevlendirilmesinin de yer aldığı bir önlemler paketini kabul etti.

It isn't packed with sugar like Bandits and Yogies (sugar can cause cancer in ferrets). Eva likes the taste of them and they have cute shapes and a crunchy texture which might help her teeth a little. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","response":"In analyzing the given product review, it can be concluded that it depicts the product in a flattering light. There are several reasons for this conclusion, which can be seen through the different aspects mentioned in the review. Firstly, the review starts by highlighting one of the product's key health benefits, stating that it's \\"one of the healthier treat options out there.\\" This implies that the reviewer considers the product to be a better choice compared to other similar treats available in the market. It is especially beneficial as it doesn't contain excessive sugar, unlike other popular treats such as Bandits and Yogies. This fact is of great importance since excessive sugar in ferret treats can lead to severe health issues like cancer. Therefore, by mentioning this point, the reviewer is showcasing the product as a safer and healthier option for the ferret, which is an attractive quality for any pet owner who prioritizes their pet's well-being. Secondly, the review talks about the ferret named Eva enjoying the taste of the product, which contributes to the positive depiction of the treat. Eva's liking of the product will likely encourage other ferret owners to consider purchasing the treats for their pets, as the taste is an important aspect when it comes to pet treats. If a pet doesn't like the taste, it will not consume it, rendering the treat useless. This mention of Eva's positive reaction to the product taste is crucial for creating a positive image and promoting the product to potential buyers. Next, the review discusses the appeal of the product's design, mentioning the \\"cute shapes\\" and the crunchy texture. These factors add to the product's desirability since pet owners often prefer treats that are visually appealing and enjoyable for their pets. The crunchy texture is also highlighted as a possible dental benefit, which may potentially help improve the ferret's dental health. Any added benefits like this contribute positively to the product's image and further portray it in a flattering light. In conclusion, the product review emphasizes the health benefits, the taste, the attractive design, and the potential dental benefits of the treats, painting the product in a flattering and appealing light. This positive portrayal could encourage other ferret owners to choose these treats over other alternatives, having confidence that they are providing their pets with a healthier, enjoyable, and visually delightful treat that might also promote better dental health."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although... answer the following question: What was the name of the band that released an album with only 5 songs? Answer:","response":"The band that released an album with only 5 songs is Opeth.

If we are to live up to our educational profession, we must look our aim in the face and honestly practise what we believe.

These shell-shaped pasta pieces come in various sizes ranging from small (conchigliette), medium (conchiglie), to large (conchiglioni) and are usually made from durum wheat semolina, like most traditional Italian pasta. The unique seashell-shaped design of conchiglie not only makes them visually appealing but also provides functional advantages when it comes to combining with sauces and other ingredients in various pasta dishes. The concave structure of these shells makes them excellent for capturing and holding different types of sauce. The combination of smooth exterior and textured interior surfaces also helps to grip onto the sauce, leading to a more delicious and flavorful dish. Conchiglie is quite versatile and can be used in a wide range of Italian dishes, such as pasta salads, soups, and casseroles. They are particularly suitable for chunkier sauces that contain vegetables, meat, or seafood, as their shell structure allows for these ingredients to become lodged inside, enhancing the flavor and texture of the final dish. Furthermore, the larger conchiglioni are ideal for stuffing with various fillings such as ricotta cheese and spinach. Once filled, the stuffed shells can be baked with more sauce and cheese to create a delectable, savory meal. In conclusion, conchiglie is an Italian pasta variety that is named after and shaped like seashells. Made from durum wheat semolina, this unique pasta is valued for its ability to capture and hold sauces, making it an excellent choice for numerous dishes, whether enjoyed hot or cold. The intricate design works exceptionally well with chunky sauces and ingredients, ensuring a perfect harmony of flavors in every bite."},{"question":"Add spaces: Toextendthesafetychaintotheplane,thetravelerpurchasesatthecheckoutoftheTravelValue&DutyFreeShopsinthesealedbagshandedout.","response":"To complete this task, I'll identify each individual word using their proper capitalization and context. 1.

It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals. - Hampstead (or ), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of London, England, northwest of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Camden, it is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for Hampstead Heath, a large, hilly expanse of parkland. It has some of the most expensive housing in the London area. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom. - 2 Willow Road is part of a terrace of three houses in Hampstead , London designed by architect Ern Goldfinger and completed in 1939 . It has been managed by the National Trust since 1995 and is open to the public . It was one of the first modernist buildings acquired by the Trust , giving rise to some controversy . Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987 . 1 -- 3 Willow Road was constructed using concrete and a facing of red brick . A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction , which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming ( this was said to be his inspiration for the name of the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger ) and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke . No. 2 , which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home , is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by Danish engineer Ove Arup at its core . The building is supported by a concrete frame , part of which is external , leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior , perhaps inspired by the Raumplan ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos . Goldfinger himself designed much of the furniture in No. 2 , and the house also contains a significant collection of 20th - century art by Bridget Riley , Marcel Duchamp , Henry Moore and Max Ernst . Entry is by timed ticket , and facilities are very limited . Nos. 1 and 3 remain private homes . - A tower block, high-rise, apartment tower, residential tower, apartment block, block of flats, or office tower is a tall building or structure used as a residential and/or office building. In some areas it may be referred to as an \\"MDU\\", standing for \\"Multi Dwelling Unit\\".

He moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s, and became a key member of the Modernist architectural movement. He is most prominently remembered for designing residential tower blocks, some of which are now listed buildings. - Hampstead Heath (locally known as \\"the heath\\") is a large, ancient London park, covering . This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay.

The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\".

Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy. They discovered a skylight, and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary. The answer is:","response":"Tony.

Description: In general, a blue ribbon represents excellence and serves as a symbol of high-quality or first-place achievements in various fields, such as academics, sports, arts, and more. It is often awarded to winners or champions in competitions, meets, and contests as a sign of recognition for their outstanding performance or superior quality. The concept of the blue ribbon dates back to its use as a badge or piece of clothing only to be worn by those identified as the best. Entity: In some cases, a blue ribbon may refer to an entity like a group or an organization dedicated to a specific cause. For example, the Blue Ribbon Foundation, which aims to raise awareness about men's health, or the Blue Ribbon Campaign against censorship, which was created in response to the Communications Decency Act. Abbreviation: Although not an abbreviation itself, the term blue ribbon is sometimes associated with abbreviations. For example, Blue Ribbon Panel, Blue Ribbon Task Force, or Blue Ribbon Committee, which are often used to represent a special group comprised of carefully selected experts or authorities, meant to investigate or solve a specific issue or problem. Human: When it comes to linking a blue ribbon to humans, it is usually in their capacity as recipients of the award or as committee members that create or oversee the blue ribbon initiatives, panels, or campaigns. Location: In rare cases, the blue ribbon may be linked to a location or establishment that promotes or supports the blue ribbon initiatives, events, or causes. For instance, a Blue Ribbon school exemplifies excellence in its teaching methods and student achievements. Similarly, it can also be incorporated into the name of a business, like a restaurant, to emphasize its exceptional quality. In summary, the answer to what the blue ribbon stands for is primarily a description but can extend to various other aspects depending on its use, such as an entity, human, location, or being related to an abbreviation. However, it is not a numeric value."},{"question":"Translate \\"¡Invierta sus accesorios de platino usados en vez de coleccionarlos en los cajones!\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"Alright, little one!

On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery. \\"Glowing obituaries\\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect. His estate was valued at \\"under £14,000\\" (equivalent to £1,290,000 as of 2018). A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul's, next to that of his wife. A:","response":"The name of the village the Sharpe family lived in after moving from Geneva is Scotforth. This information is provided in the following sentence from the text: \\"Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.\\" The reasoning process was simple in this case: Find the reference to the family's move from Geneva in the text and identify what information follows that directly answers the question.

Options: (A) 172 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 180 (E) 120 Think first, then make a decision. Some random thoughts:","response":"To convert 50 meters per second (mps) to kilometers per hour (kmph), we need to follow a few steps: Step 1: Convert meters to kilometers. 1 meter = 0.001 kilometers (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer) Step 2: Convert seconds to hours. 1 second = 1/3600 hours (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour) Step 3: Multiply the given speed (50 mps) by the conversion factors from step 1 and step 2: 50 meters/second × 0.001 kilometers/meter × 3600 seconds/hour Step 4: Simplify the expression: 50 × 0.001 × 3600 = 50 × 3.6 = 180 So, 50 mps is equal to 180 kmph.

Possible answers: indifferent, bored, loved A:","response":"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that Jordan will feel loved. Ash and Jordan both go to the movies to see a good movie, and the statement \\"Ash loved Jordan well enough\\" highlights that there is a strong emotional connection between the two. This level of affection is likely to have a positive impact on Jordan, making them feel loved and cared for during their shared experience of watching a movie together. As they are going to see a good movie, Jordan is presumably also excited about the choice of movie, which further reinforces the idea that they will not feel bored or indifferent. On the contrary, bonding with Ash through a shared experience, such as watching an enjoyable movie together, is likely to bolster the emotional connection and feelings of love between the two."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Step 1: Identify a relevant topic To generate a context and a hypothesis, we first need to choose a topic or subject that is of interest or relevance. In this case, let's choose the environmental impact of single-use plastics. Step 2: Define the context Now that we have a topic, we can create a context - a scenario that introduces the problem or question being studied. In this case, the context can be defined as: \\"Single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, bottles, and straws, are commonly used in everyday life. These items are often disposed of irresponsibly, leading to significant environmental pollution. Landfills are overflowing with plastic waste, and oceans are full of microplastics, which can harm marine life. Efforts to reduce plastic consumption and waste have been implemented, but the issue persists on a global scale.\\" Step 3: Develop the hypothesis With the context established, the next step is to create a hypothesis that can be tested through research or experimentation. A hypothesis is an educated guess or a testable statement about the relationship between variables. In this case, our hypothesis could be: \\"Implementing a mandatory single-use plastic tax or ban would significantly reduce the negative environmental impact caused by plastic waste.\\" Step 4: Justification The hypothesis is based on existing efforts to reduce plastic consumption, such as plastic bag taxes and bans on certain single-use plastics. By making these initiatives mandatory instead of voluntary, the assumption is that it would create a more significant positive impact, leading to reduced plastic pollution in the environment. The hypothesis can be tested through research on the effects of existing plastic reduction initiatives and by comparing the environmental impact before and after implementing mandatory policies on a larger scale."},{"question":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: He was practicing deep breathing techniques, he had to have great control of his what? Possible A: bringing air into body bringing air into lungs, abdominal muscles, bringing air into lungs, air, oxygen Why is \\"abdominal muscles\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","response":"Deep breathing techniques often involve manipulation and control of various muscles involved in the respiratory process, especially the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. When a person breathes, air is drawn into the lungs as a result of a decrease in pressure caused by the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs). In deep or diaphragmatic breathing, which is a form of slow, deep breathing, one consciously slows the breath and uses the diaphragm, rather than the chest, to breathe. The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it inflates the lungs, causing you to inhale. Abdominal breathing is facilitated by the movement of the diaphragm which pushes the abdominal organs downward, thus expanding the belly. By exerting control over these muscles, and by controlling the speed and depth of breaths, an individual can achieve deep breathing. That's why \\"abdominal muscles\\" are proposed as an answer aligned with human common sense for someone practicing deep breathing techniques. In essence, their practice involves exercising great control over their respiratory muscles, particularly their diaphragm and abdominal muscles, to regulate their breathing."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens in what will become North Texas, 35,000Â BC.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Turks who have more secular views argue that the government's social policies are taking the country in a dangerous direction, our correspondent says. Mr Erdogan has previously urged women to have three children, and has lashed out against abortion and birth by Caesarean section. His latest remarks were delivered at a women's conference in Istanbul. \\"In the workplace, you cannot treat a man and a pregnant woman in the same way,\\" Mr Erdogan said, according to the Anadolu news agency.

Answer:","response":"Roddy Woomble and Tom Fletcher have both had successful music careers, but when delving deeper, it appears that Tom Fletcher has had a more diverse job experience. Born in 1976, Roddy Woomble is best known as the lead vocalist of the Scottish indie rock band Idlewild. With the band, Woomble has released numerous successful albums. Parallel to his contributions with Idlewild, Woomble has also embarked upon a significant solo career, with several albums under his belt. Apart from singing, he has also ventured into songwriting, creating both for Idlewild and his solo projects. Thus, his professional background predominantly lies within music, focusing primarily on singing and songwriting. On the other hand, Tom Fletcher, born in 1985, has had a more varied career path in comparison. Fletcher is indeed a musician, known for being a founding member of the pop rock band McFly, where he serves roles as lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter. Concurrent to his musical career, Fletcher has also made a mark on literature. He co-authored the children's book \\"The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas\\" with his bandmate Dougie Poynter, which became a bestseller. This initiated his writing career that further led to a series of successful children’s books mainly based on the \\"The Dinosaur that Pooped\\" series. Moreover, Fletcher served a brief stint as a YouTube vlogger. In 2012, he started his own YouTube channel and gained popularity through it by posting his personal life vlogs and music videos. His wedding speech video, which he shared on this platform, went viral and amassed millions of views. Furthermore, Fletcher explored acting early in his life. Before forming McFly, he had a small role in the movie 'The Hunted'. Also, he made it onto the stage in the musical version of 'Back to the Future' in 2020, playing the role of George McFly. In addition to his music career, Fletcher's work includes writing, vlogging, and acting. His endeavors span several branches of the entertainment industry, which makes him a more diverse professional in contrast to Woomble.

The sentence \\"otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés\\" implies that the movie in question exhibits an overabundance of unoriginal or overused visual and verbal elements. To say that a movie \\"drowns\\" in clichés suggests that these repetitive elements may diminish its overall quality and detract from the viewing experience. Clichés, especially in the domain of film, are often perceived as uninspired or lazy; they can make the movie appear formulaic or predictable. As a result, the use of clichés can cheapen a film's impact on its audience, creating an impression that the filmmakers have not been innovative or ambitious in the development of the story, characters, or dialogue. In the context of a movie review, a negative sentiment like this may lead potential viewers to question whether the movie is worth their time and money. Consequently, a movie review that criticizes a film for drowning in clichés could discourage people from seeing the film, thus having a negative effect on its commercial and critical success."},{"question":"Dayna: Is this some private account?

These three texts are the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. In Russian, the translation of \\"Prasthanatrayi\\" would most likely preserve the original Sanskrit term, as the concept is specific to Indian philosophy and might lose its meaning if translated literally.

Controversy: Former EC president Jacques Delors made a u-turn over Britain's role in the single market One of the key architects of the European single market today admitted Britain would be better off leaving the European Union. Mr Delors's radical U-turn comes 22 years after he infuriated Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other Eurosceptics by trying to force European federalism on the UK. In November 1990 the economist became the subject of a famous headline in the Sun newspaper which read: 'Up Your Delors!' Frenchman Jacques Delors, who was president of the European Commission three times, suggested that 'the British are solely interested in their own economic interests, and nothing else. We could offer them another kind of partnership.' Facing a fight: Prime Minister David Cameron will now have to confront his own party's Eurosceptic camp following the comments from OPTIONS: - Britain - British - Cameron - Delors - EC - EU - Europe - European - European Commission - European Union - Eurosceptics - French - Frenchman - Jacques Delors - Margaret Thatcher - PM - Sun - Thatcher - Tory - UK - Up Your Delors - Yours Delors","response":"Jacques Delors In this passage, the correct answer is \\"Jacques Delors.\\" The passage talks about the former EC president Jacques Delors and his change in viewpoint on Britain's role in the European single market.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Porky's Context: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker (who has a running feud with Tommy) walks...

Write a sentence that describes this data:","response":"The data provided pertains to certain cultural and regional aspects of the Philippine Islands, with a specific emphasis on their ethnic groups, language, and cuisine. The ethnic group mentioned here is the Zamboangans, who reside in the Zamboanga Peninsula region of Mindanao. They are key contributors to the country’s cultural diversity and play a significant role in shaping the sociocultural fabric of the Philippines. In terms of language, this dataset highlights Philippine Spanish, a variant of standard Spanish that is spoken in the Philippines. Even though Filipinos primarily speak Filipino and English, Spanish was deeply ingrained in the country’s history due to the Spanish colonization, leading to this unique variant. The influence of Spanish is still visible in different aspects of Filipino culture, including language and place names. As for cuisine, the data points towards Batchoy, a popular Filipino soup that originated from the Philippine Islands. This dish, typically native to the Visayas region, is a symbol of the country's rich gastronomic heritage that is shaped by several internal and external influences. The locals commonly serve batchoy with egg noodles garnished with pork organs, crushed pork cracklings, chopped vegetables, and occasionally a raw egg. Thus, the provided data allows us to better understand the distinct ethnic identities, linguistic aspects, and culinary traditions that constitute the Philippines' diverse cultural mosaic."},{"question":"Given the question: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet. Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","response":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. The primary reason for this difference in atmospheric temperature is the presence of a species on Norlon that emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which means it contributes to the greenhouse effect by trapping heat from the sun in the planet's atmosphere, thus increasing the planet's overall temperature. On the other hand, Bothar does not have a species that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. As a result, its atmosphere is likely to have a lower concentration of greenhouse gases, leading to a cooler atmosphere compared to Norlon. It is worth noting that although the two planets are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and species of animals, the absence of CO2-emitting species on Bothar indicates that its biosphere might be different in terms of ecological balance and overall impact on the environment. This could lead to other differences in climate and environmental conditions between Norlon and Bothar, aside from just the atmospheric temperature."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Title: Don't wait to lose weight!

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away.

Engineered wood products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","response":"The construction industry is responsible for creating a wide variety of structures, utilizing different materials and techniques based on regional and technological advancements. In the context of the given excerpt, the answer to the question \\"Construction creates?\\" can be stated as: Construction creates residential and commercial buildings using timber-framed construction and engineered wood products as both structural and aesthetic materials. Timber-framed construction is a method in which a building's structural framework is made up of wooden beams, posts, and trusses. This technique is especially prevalent in the construction of new domestic housing in many parts of the world. The use of timber as a primary construction material offers benefits such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and design flexibility. Engineered wood products, on the other hand, are manufactured by combining wood fibers, strands, or veneers with adhesives to produce composite materials with specific properties. Some examples of engineered wood products include plywood, oriented strand board (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), and cross-laminated timber (CLT). These products are becoming increasingly popular in the construction industry due to their versatility, strength, and environmental benefits. These engineered wood products are suitable for use in both residential and commercial buildings, serving multiple purposes. They can function as structural components, such as support beams, floor joists, and roof trusses, providing strength and stability to the overall building. Additionally, they can be applied for aesthetic purposes, adding character, warmth, and a natural element to the design of the structures they are used in. In summary, the construction industry creates buildings with a focus on sustainability and design flexibility by utilizing timber-framed construction techniques and incorporating engineered wood products as both structural and aesthetic materials. This has led to the increased use of these materials in residential and commercial buildings across the globe."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose in increase in industrialisation happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"An increase in industrialization can potentially affect the recycling of aluminum cans in several ways: 1. Increase in demand for aluminum products: Industrialization typically leads to increased production and consumption of goods. As demand for aluminum products grows, the need for recycled aluminum also increases. This could encourage more recycling activities to keep up with the demand for aluminum materials. 2. Improved recycling technology: Industrialization often brings advancements in technology. With more sophisticated recycling equipment and processes, the efficiency of recycling aluminum cans may improve, leading to greater recycling rates. 3. Governmental policies and regulations: Growing industrialization may prompt governments to enforce stricter waste management and recycling policies. These policies could bolster aluminum recycling efforts, either through increased funding for recycling programs or stricter penalties for not recycling. 4. Public awareness and consumer behavior: As industrialization progresses, public awareness about environmental issues may also increase. This could lead more consumers to actively participate in recycling efforts, including recycling aluminum cans and foil. 5. Infrastructure development: With increased industrialization, there may be improvements in the infrastructure for recycling aluminum. More recycling facilities may be built, and existing ones may be upgraded to handle increased quantities of aluminum waste. The supposed perturbation does have a direct and indirect effect on the recycling process. Directly, the increased demand for recycled aluminum and improvements in recycling technology can lead to more efficient and effective recycling processes. Indirectly, governmental policies, public awareness, and infrastructure development can contribute to higher recycling rates and a more robust recycling system. Overall, an increase in industrialization can lead to more aluminum cans being recycled, provided that efforts are made to improve and expand recycling facilities and processes."},{"question":"pick from the following.

Usage: Head: PersonX achieves PersonX's goal, Tail: to use the knowledge to better their life. In the given input, the phrases are separated by <sep> which helps in identifying the Head phrase and the Tail phrase. Part #2: Understand the sequence of events involving PersonX in the Head and Tail phrases. Usage: In the Head phrase, PersonX achieves their goal, while in the Tail, they use the knowledge to better their life. There is a sequence of events happening where PersonX first gains knowledge and then achieves their goal using the same knowledge. Part #3: Determine if the Head happens after the Tail or not. Usage: In this case, the Head happens after the Tail. The reason is that PersonX has to use the knowledge (Tail) first to better their life which in turn helps them achieve their goal (Head). Part #4: Classify the answer as \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" based on the sequence of events. Usage: Yes. The answer is classified as \\"Yes\\" because the Head event happens after the Tail event, which meets the criteria for a \\"Yes\\" classification."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Answer:","response":"Frank learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers. This is because he focused on reading about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly, while Greg studied natural selection directly, which explains how organisms with advantageous traits tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers."},{"question":"Given the sentence \\"A girl in a white gi with red gloves and a red belt holds her chin while an older male looks on.\\" can we conclude that \\"A girl is wearing red gloves and belt.\\"?

It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\" - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness. It might also be called a \\"wild\\" or \\"natural\\" area. Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated Wilderness Areas, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property. In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed. Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas. - The Pepperbox Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the New York Forest Preserve , lies entirely within the town of Webb in Herkimer County . Stillwater Reservoir and the Beaver River Primitive Area form the southern boundary , while the north bank of the West Branch of the Oswegatchie River generally forms the northern boundary . The western boundary is the county line , and the eastern boundary is the Raven Lake Road and the Five Ponds Wilderness Area . It contains 46 bodies of water on 270 acres ( 1.1 km2 ) and 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) of foot trails . The terrain is generally flat with a few small , rolling hills . Swampland predominates with spruce , fir and red maple . Alder swamps , marsh and beaver flows are also common . The drier sites are vegetated with pole - size northern hardwoods . The entire area appears to have been heavily burned over and logged in the past and is not particularly scenic by usual standards . It is , however , ideally suited for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing . Several ponds are found in the area . They are generally of low productivity and some may even be sterile . The area is classed as wilderness because of its remoteness and also due to the extensive wetland ecosystems involved . The flora and fauna associated with moist ecosystems , such as found in the Pepperbox , seem to exhibit more species diversity than any others in the Adirondacks . Birdlife and small mammals are especially abundant . There is very little human use of the area at present , except for light hunting . Access is moderately difficult because of the distance from public roads and the lack of a trail system . - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world. - The Saint Lawrence River (Tuscarora: \\"Kahnawákye\\"; Mohawk: \\"Kaniatarowanenneh\\", meaning \\"big waterway\\") is a large river in the middle latitudes of North America. The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Oswegatchie River is a river in northern New York that flows from the Adirondack Mountains north to the Saint Lawrence River. Much of it is within Adirondack State Park. The city of Ogdensburg developed at the mouth of the river at its confluence with the St. Lawrence. - The Five Ponds Wilderness Area, an Adirondack Park unit of New York's Forest Preserve, is located in the towns of Fine and Clifton in St. Lawrence County, the town of Webb in Herkimer County and the town of Long Lake in Hamilton County. It includes 1,064 acres (4.3 km) of private inholdings, 99 bodies of water covering 1,964 acres (7.9 km), 57.9 miles (93.2 km) of trails, and 14 lean-tos. - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City. The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse. - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York. - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation. - A lean-to is a type of simple structure originally added to an existing building with the rafters \\"leaning\\" against another wall. Free standing lean-to structures are generally used as shelters. One traditional type of lean-to is known by its Finnish name \\"laavu\\". - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'instance of'.

Hide or lock up anything that might let them know you want to get away. If your spouse goes through your things, store your personal items at a friend or family member’s house. Your spouse may sabotage your plans or become more dangerous if they know you are about to leave. Confide in a family member, neighbor, or friend about your spouse’s abuse and your plans to leave. Tell them when you are planning to escape and where you will go. Ask them to check in on you afterwards to ensure you got out safely. If you decide to talk to a family member, choose carefully. Family members sometimes tip off spouses before a planned escape. Only confide in those you trust deeply. If your neighbors are trustworthy, you can also ask them to call the police if they hear your spouse abusing you or your kids before you leave. Change your phone number or get a new phone when you leave your spouse. Create new passwords and PIN numbers for your online accounts, including your bank account, email account, and social media accounts. If your spouse harasses you over the phone or online, block them. If you think there is any chance your spouse might have installed a keylogger or other tracking software on your computer, don’t use it. Use a computer at a public library or internet café until you can get a clean computer of your own. Be cautious when you go anywhere by yourself, especially at night. Park close to buildings and avoid using headphones. Stay away from places where your spouse might look for you, and change your route to work, school, and anywhere else you go often. If you feel unsafe, ask somebody to accompany you or call 911 or emergency services. If you’re concerned that your spouse may stalk or harass you, consider asking your boss if you can change your hours at work or work from home. If you have kids, discuss potential safety risks with them. Explaining the situation as best you can may help avoid trauma. Teach them how to leave the house safely and call 911, and have them come up with a list of people they can trust if something happens. For example, you might pinpoint a nearby area they can go to if you are in danger, such as a park or neighbor's house. If you have an older adolescent or teen, you might also give them a list of phone numbers of shelters or organizations for abuse victims in case they need to make calls. If you feel threatened by your spouse, you can speak to someone anonymously by calling a hotline. They can help you stay safe and advise you on developing an escape plan. For those in the U.S., you can get support by calling the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. For those in the UK, call 0808 2000 247 to reach a 24-hour helpline. If your spouse threatens to harm you or your children, you may need to file for an order of protection against them. You may file a restraining order against a current or former spouse, even if you left some time ago. Reach out to your city's courthouse to find out the protocol in your area. This order can help you keep your children in your care and away from an abusive spouse. It also may help you stay in your family home temporarily (and have your spouse removed) until the hearing date. Usually, no fees are associated with filing a restraining order.","response":"It's important to keep your plans secret when you want to get away from a spouse who is not nice to you.

Article: Everyone needs safe drinking water, but about 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water. Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further. Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days. City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

The options are: 1. New car 2. Promotion 3. Boredom 4. Impatience 5. Pressure Step 2: Analyze the options given Now that we understand the question, we will analyze the options given to determine which one would most likely be the appropriate answer: 1. New car: A new car would provide a better driving experience and potential status symbol, but it wouldn't necessarily involve extra responsibilities and benefits tied to work. 2. Promotion: A promotion generally involves getting more responsibilities at work, usually accompanied by increased benefits, such as higher pay or a higher position. 3. Boredom: Boredom isn't something most people would fantasize about, and it doesn't necessarily have extra responsibilities and benefits associated with it. 4. Impatience: Impatience is not likely to be the subject of a fantasy in this context, as it does not include responsibilities or benefits tied to work. 5. Pressure: Pressure isn't something most people would fantasize about since it's usually considered a negative feeling and doesn't involve additional responsibilities and benefits in a positive way, specifically tied to work. Step 3: Identify the most appropriate option Given the analysis in Step 2, a \\"promotion\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question. It is a common desire among employed individuals and directly represents the exchange of responsibilities and benefits tied to work. Conclusion: A human would choose \\"promotion\\" to answer the question above because it directly relates to the pros and cons associated with additional responsibilities and benefits in a work context. A promotion generally comes with increased responsibilities, but it also tends to bring additional benefits such as higher pay, more authority, or a better job title – all factors that someone might fantasize about while driving to work."},{"question":"Read this: An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] and the situation: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early. Team Bob went at the mouth of the river, where the freshwater met the salty seawater in the hope that more turbidity from the river and more nutrients will attract more fish. Team Dan went south where they knew there was less of a thermocline, so they could catch fish without taking risks. Answer the following question: Which team had their crew members to fewer risks than necessary? A:","response":"Team Dan had their crew members take fewer risks than necessary. This is because they chose a location where there was less of a thermocline, which implies lesser changes in water temperature as they dive. Sudden temperature changes, or thermoclines, can be risky for divers as they can affect their physiological and physical comfort levels underwater, thus affecting their ability to perform tasks like fishing efficiently. Moreover, in areas of significant thermoclines, the temperature change can impact the distribution and presence of fish, making fishing potentially more challenging. Therefore, by choosing an area with a less pronounced thermocline, Team Dan has tried to minimize the inherent risks associated with their underwater fishing activity."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Foster and Farrington for the following movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament.

Article: You can love them or hate them, but no matter which tourist destination you visit, chances are you'll see someone with their head buried in a Lonely Planet guidebook. Lonely Planet is one of the world's largest travel guide brands, publishing more than 500 different guides in eight languages.The popular brand also produces television shows, websites and podcasts all devoted to travel. Some people praise Lonely Planet books because they make traveling easy and affordable.They also save time and make sure you don't miss the best things. They also provide the reviews of hostels, hotels, restaurants and ticket information about your destination. This can be great if you're a nervous traveler, or if you haven't traveled by yourself before.If you're in a country where you don't speak the language, sometimes there's nothing better than getting into a taxi and opening up a guidebook.You simply point to a map that directs the taxi driver to a hostel that's cheap and clean, with friendly staff and cold beer. But others criticize Lonely Planet and other travel guide publishers like them.They say guidebooks take the fun and spontaneity out of traveling, and that part of the enjoyment of travel comes from the fact that anything can happen.They also regret that if you follow a guidebook, you'll end up doing the same thing and having the same experience as everyone else.You might end up seeing the same group of people over and over, because everyone is reading the same book and following the same route. Another criticism of travel guides is that they have a large impact on local communities.For example, some locals devote their lives to behaving in ways that attract tourists.They pretend to live a traditional lifestyle, wear traditional clothes and live in traditional houses in order to attract the tourist dollar.

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Alexander Hamilton was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, and the founder of the nation's financial system. He also founded the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and the New York Post newspaper. He served as the first Secretary of the Treasury in the administration of President George Washington from 1789 to 1795. His life was full of controversies and personal hardship, rising from difficult beginnings to become one of the most influential figures in U.S. history. Born illegitimately in the mid-18th century on the Caribbean island of Nevis, he moved to New York as a teenager and quickly established himself in political and legal circles. Despite his lasting influence, Hamilton's career was cut short by a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr, in which he was mortally wounded. Today, Hamilton is widely regarded as a visionary and his ideas about economics, politics, and human nature continue to be influential. He has received renewed attention in recent years thanks to the critically acclaimed musical \\"Hamilton,\\" which serves as a modern reinterpretation of his life and work.

While your console's two flashing red lights will disappear on their own after the console comes down in temperature, there are a few things you can do to prevent your console from overheating in the future: Make sure the console has plenty of space in all directions. Lay your console horizontally, not vertically. Clean any dust out of the console's vents (you can use a damp cloth or a vacuum for this). Keep the console in a cool, dry place; avoid having it in the sun or near a heater. . The Red Ring of Death is somewhat non-specific, but you may be able to fix it by applying a new layer of thermal paste to your Xbox 360's heat sinks. As with most internal issues, the Red Ring of Death is a problem best left to professionals. The easiest way to fix this error is by using an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox 360 to your TV; if that isn't an option, check your current A/V cables to see how they're plugged in. If they're loose, tighten them and then restart your console. If your A/V cables are fine, you'll need to replace them. If the error continues displaying even when using new A/V cables, your console's A/V input may be broken. You can either send your console in for repairs or switch over to a different display that allows you to use an HDMI cable. Microsoft's official policy for a CD drive that's stuck open is to wiggle the tray from side to side, wiggle it up and down, and then gently push it shut. If pressing the \\"Eject\\" button doesn't prompt the tray to pop out, you'll need to take the Xbox 360 in for service. If the CD drive is stuck shut, you can try opening it by pushing a bent paper clip into the \\"Eject\\" hole on the front or back of the console. If this doesn't work, your Xbox 360 needs service. If the CD drive works but won't read two or more of your game discs, try removing any attached USB items. If it still won't read your discs, you'll need to take your Xbox 360 in for service. For problems not related to an error code (e.g., unexpected shut-downs), you may need to replace your Xbox 360's power source. This is because Xbox 360 power bricks have roughly 5 years of life before they begin to malfunction. Malfunctioning power bricks can also cause your Xbox 360 to freeze or otherwise under-perform. If your Xbox 360 won't turn on even after replacing the power brick, check the USB slots to see if any of their connectors are bent. Bent connectors can cause the Xbox 360 to fail to turn on; if they are bent, prying them loose with a screwdriver may fix the problem. If you use an HDMI cable and your Xbox 360 isn't displaying video properly, you can try using a different HDMI cable to address the problem. Keep in mind that the problem may also lie with your TV, in which case you'll either need to use a different HDMI port on your TV or use a different TV entirely. If none of the above instructions have fixed the problem you're having with your Xbox 360, you'll need to send it in for repairs.

The train was travelling to an army camp in Cairo when it came off the tracks in the Badrashin area of Giza. It is not yet known what caused the accident. Egypt's roads and railways have a poor safety record. Last November 50 children died after a train crash into their school bus. Both the transport minister and the head of the railway authority were forced to resign as a result of the crash, which took place in November near Manfalut, 350km south of Cairo. Investigations later showed the barriers at the crossing were not closed because the signal operator had fallen asleep. Monday's incident occurred as the army train was heading from Upper Egypt into Cairo. Reports say more than 1,300 passengers were aboard the train when the accident happened shortly after midnight. The passengers wounded in the accident have been taken to hospitals, the governor of Giza said. An eyewitness told BBC Arabic that he saw two dozen dead bodies at the scene of the accident. The latest incident could increase the pressure on the government to deal with the safety of trains, the BBC's Said Shehata reports from Cairo. Four years ago, some 18 people were killed and dozens injured in an accident crash between two passenger trains in the Giza area. And in 2002, a train caught fire in Cairo, killing 373 people.

Article: Thank you for trusting me. I enjoy exchanging my ideas with yours The first thing I want to tell you is that if the boys are calling you names it is their fault, not yours. Boys, at your age, are different from girls. They are trying to prove that they are manly and then often do this by picking on someone who can't really fight back. This is, of course, wrong but it happens. In general, the boys know they are bigger and stronger than you are, so they can make fun of you and make you cry and then laugh about it. If you let them see that they are hurting you, they will only do it more. It isn't that they want to hurt you; they simply want to make themselves feel superior . It's stupid, but it is common. In English we say \\" sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.\\" Canadian children learn this from their mothers because the same thing that is happening to you in China also happens here. The best ways of getting the boys to stop calling your names is to simply ignore them, knowing that the names can't hurt you and that the boys are being stupid. If you can laugh at them they will get tired of trying to make you cry and they'll give up. It won't be easy, but, trust me, it will work. There is also something else working in your favor and that is that you are growing up and the boys are beginning to notice you as a young woman. I suspect some of them actually like you and are making fun of you just to get your attention. Again, it's stupid but it happens. In reality, you can control this situation by not letting them see you getting hurt. Laugh at them, tell them they're acting like children and they should grow up and then walk away with your head held high. One more thing, Nancy. It is very important that you stop hurting yourself. If someone else hurts you, it is bad enough but you should't make it worse by then hurting yourself.

Step 2: Identify the main information from both sentences Sentence 1: The crater is cool and windy up there, even in the summer. Sentence 2: The atmosphere surrounding the crater is always cool and windy. Step 3: Compare the main information of both sentences In Sentence 1, the main information focuses on the cool and windy conditions at the crater, even in the summer. The emphasis is on being prepared for these conditions with sturdy shoes and warm clothing. In Sentence 2, the main information focuses on the atmosphere surrounding the crater itself and describes the conditions as \\"always cool and windy.\\" Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence Although both sentences discuss the cool and windy conditions at the crater, Sentence 1 specifically mentions that it's cool and windy even in the summer, while Sentence 2 states that the atmosphere is always cool and windy.

OPTIONS: [i] Yes [ii] No","response":"[ii] No The answer is not simply \\"heat.\\" What primarily enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned are greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), along with a range of other pollutants. When fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are combusted, the primary byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2). This is due to the fact that these fuels are hydrocarbons, which means they are made up of hydrogen and carbon. During combustion, the carbon in these fuels combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas and the primary driver of climate change because it absorbs heat in the atmosphere and prevents it from escaping out into space, leading to the greenhouse effect—an increase in the Earth’s surface temperature. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing dramatically since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Besides carbon dioxide, burning fossil fuels also emit other pollutants. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a byproduct of burning coal, which can contribute to acid rain and respiratory illnesses. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are also released, which combine with other substances in the air to form smog and acid rain. Particulate matter, small particles of pollutants, is also released. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause a range of health problems, including heart and lung diseases. In the process of combustion, heat is indeed released. This heat is used to create steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity in power plants. But while heat is a product of burning fossil fuels, it is not what enters the atmosphere. Rather, it is the greenhouse gases and other pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. Therefore, to the question \\"What enters the atmosphere when coal, oil, and natural gas are burned?\\", the most accurate response would include greenhouse gases (mostly carbon dioxide), as well as other pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a text of the tweet and a corresponding label whether this tweet is 'Offensive', 'Hate Speech' or 'Neither'.

However, it is essential to consider the limitations of text-based analysis when trying to understand sentiments.

Afterwards, Raizo meets the rest of his clan atop a city skyscraper in Berlin. There he is instructed by Lord Ozunu to execute another kunoichi traitor like Kiriko. He rebels against Lord Ozunu by cutting his face with a kyoketsu-shoge and engages in combat against his fellow ninja kin. Barely surviving, he falls off the roof of the skyscraper and into a river. Raizo recovers from his ordeal and begins to intervene and foil subsequent Ozunu assassination attempts, including a disguised female assassin at a laundromat. Meanwhile, Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) has been investigating money-linked political murders and finds out that they are possibly connected to the Ozunu. She defies her superior, Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), and retrieves secret agency files to find out more about the investigation. Mika meets Raizo and convinces him to see Maslow for protection as well as to provide evidence against the Ozunu. However, Raizo is arrested by Maslow and abducted by agents from Europol for interrogation. Although feeling betrayed, Mika is assured by Maslow that he is still on her side and gives her...

Carver was handed the reins at St James' Park until the end of the season on Monday, starting with Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Hull. Eleventh-placed Newcastle have lost their last three games and failed to win in four as the 50-year-old former assistant manager seeks his first victory at the helm since succeeding Alan Pardew earlier this month. Newly-appointed Newcastle boss John Carver is determined to not let his side's season 'drift away' 'I'm delighted to have got the job until the end of the season,' Carver told nufc.co.uk. 'Everyone knows I love this club and my goals are simple - to finish as high as we can in the Premier League and get as many points as we can. 'Everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but I am not going to allow that to happen. Carver will be hoping he can pick up his first win at the helm when his side travel to Hull City on Saturday. 'Those who are saying that don't know me, don't know the people around me and don't know this group of players. 'We're much more professional than that. We can't afford to let the season drift away and I won't allow it to happen. 'I'm too demanding and I won't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of May.' Carver (left) and Peter Beardsley (right) with Callum Roberts (centre) after he signed his professional contract. Carver will work alongside Steve Stone and Dave Watson, the latter having stepped up from looking after the Magpies' Under-18 side, and says he plans to spend as much time on the training ground as he did when he was Pardew's assistant. 'I love being on the training pitch and the role of the head coach is to be hands-on out here,' Carver said. 'When you are a manager you have to manage the football club, but the role has changed and it gives me maximum time on the training ground, coaching the players. Alan Pardew (right) left the North-East club in December to become the new Crystal Palace manager. 'What I have done is given Steve (Stone) and Dave (Watson) more responsibility because they are very good at what they do, and it is important that you delegate to those who are talented. 'But when it comes to the meat of the session, it is my responsibility to prepare the team for the final 16 games. 'The players have been really positive and have responded. 'Even though we haven't won a game yet, I think we've played some nice stuff in spells. 'Ultimately though, it is about scoring goals and winning games so that needs to change. Top scorer Papiss Cisse could return for Newcastle after Senegal went out of the Africa Cup of Nations. 'We've done plenty of work on that on the training pitch and hopefully that little bit of luck we need will fall our way this weekend.' Carver's hopes of a first victory in charge could be boosted by the return of top scorer Papiss Cisse following Senegal's early exit from the Africa Nations Cup on Tuesday. Senegal's 2-0 defeat to Algeria saw them crash out at the group stage and nine-goal Cisse, who scored twice in a 2-2 home draw with Hull in September, could now be available for the trip to the KC Stadium. Hull City boss Steve Bruce, who was linked with the Newcastle job, will want to stop Carver getting his first win. What are the important parts of this article?","response":"1. John Carver has been appointed as Newcastle's head coach until the end of the season. 2.

In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens.

Lech Walesa helped found the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980. He is being treated in the same hospital as an old communist nemesis. General Czeslaw Kiszczak played a key role in imposing martial law in 1981. Hospital doctors are examining Kiszczak to see if he is fit to stand trial. Article:","response":"Title: Poland's Nobel Peace Prize Winner Bedridden Alongside Infamous Foe Polish icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Lech Walesa, has been confined to a hospital bed following a broken leg. Sharing the same medical facility with him is his one-time arch enemy from the communist era, General Czeslaw Kiszczak. Notably, these two historical figures find themselves under the same roof, temporarily united albeit in contrasting circumstances. Lech Walesa, the former Polish President who came to global fame after helping to establish the Solidarity trade union movement in 1980, is recuperating from a broken leg in a hospital in Gdansk, Northern Poland. The tireless activist, who has for decades fought for workers' rights and the betterment of society, now finds himself facing an unexpected adversity. Meanwhile, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, now in his 90s, was once a defining figure in Poland's authoritarian regime. He played a pivotal role in implementing martial law back in 1981, a decision that aimed to suppress the burgeoning workers' movement led by Walesa. As Kiszczak is currently under medical examination, doctors at the hospital are deliberating whether he is fit to stand trial for his past actions. As fate would have it, these two historical adversaries now lie bedridden within the same institution, reminiscent of a time when their actions and ideals stood in stark contrast to one another. On one hand, there is the celebrated Nobel Peace Prize winner, Lech Walesa, a testament to his dedication to the cause of freedom, democracy, and social justice. While on the other, General Czeslaw Kiszczak, a key agent of a regime whose influence strangled the voice of an entire nation. The 1980 foundation of the Solidarity movement marked a turning point for Poland, as the independent trade union stood fearlessly against the might of the communist state. Under Walesa's guidance, the movement sowed the seeds of democracy, which would come to full bloom years later. Even after the imposition of martial law in 1981, it was this movement led by Walesa that would help usher an era of significant reforms in Eastern Europe. It is a poignant reminder of the power of ordinary people to enact change, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. These two figures, with their intertwined histories, represent both sides of a struggle for freedom and democracy. Years on, the echoes of their rivalry resurface in a shared hospital ward - an irony that seemingly underscores the resilience of the human spirit. Lech Walesa's journey from electrician to the first democratic President of Poland showcases the power of individual conviction and unwavering dedication. As he recovers from his injury at the Gdansk hospital, it is without doubt that his struggle for a better future will continue. On the other hand, the fate of General Czeslaw Kiszczak lies in the hands of doctors and the judicial system, his past actions under scrutiny for their roles in suppressing an entire nation's cry for democracy and social justice."},{"question":"Corporación Estatal de Radio y Televisión (CERTV) is a radio and television network operating from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist. He had been assured by his teacher Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. During Eastertide 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer Niccolo Paganini play in Frankfurt. In July he wrote to his mother, \\"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\\" By Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master Friedrich Wieck, who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him. During his studies with Wieck, it has been claimed that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by the use of a mechanical device designed to strengthen the weakest fingers, a device which held back one finger while he exercised the others. This claim has been discredited by Clara Schumann, who said that the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself refers to it as \\"an affliction of the whole hand\\". Some have argued that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was unlikely to have been caused by a finger strengthening device. Schumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under Heinrich Dorn, a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the Leipzig Opera. About this time Schumann considered composing an opera on the subject of Hamlet. Why did he abandon the idea of a concert career?","response":"Robert Schumann abandoned the idea of a concert career due to a hand injury that affected his ability to play the piano at the level required for a virtuoso pianist. This injury, whether caused by a mechanical finger-strengthening device or \\"an affliction of the whole hand\\" as Schumann himself described it, led to chronic issues with the hand, not just a single finger. As a result, he could no longer pursue the demanding career of a concert pianist, so he decided to focus on composing music instead."},{"question":"Margarita la tornera (Margarita the Gatekeeper) is an opera in three acts composed by Ruperto Chapí to a libretto by Carlos Fernández Shaw, based on a dramatic poem by José Zorrilla.

The new law, which has already drawn significant condemnation from both local and international human rights organizations, states that any public protest must be authorized by the government at least three days in advance. This law also permits the Interior Ministry to prohibit any meeting or assembly of over ten people, Reuters reports. The new policy has garnered significant criticism, particularly because it bans protests near places of worship outright. Despite the government's attempts to deter public dissent, the new law has seemingly incited a flurry of fresh protests. Today, supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood took to the streets in several cities across Egypt to express their dissatisfaction with the new law and the current political climate in the country. Elsewhere in Cairo, female students of the pro-government Al-Azhar University for Islamic Learning coordinated a demonstration in which they stormed the dean's office and destroyed her desk on campus. This series of events follows a protest held a day earlier at the Al-Azhar University, where students partnered with another school for a demonstration that was forcefully dispersed by police using tear gas. This marked the first official enforcement of the new law since its implementation. Although the law has faced scrutiny due to fears that it will further compromise civil liberties and human rights within Egypt, the country's prime minister has argued that it is, in fact, designed to \\"protect the rights of protesters.\\" According to the BBC, the prime minister clarified that the law does not require individuals to seek permission to protest. Rather, it necessitates that they provide notice of their intention to hold a demonstration beforehand. Organizations like Amnesty International have voiced their concerns over the potential dangers of this new policy. They believe that the law poses a significant threat to the freedom of assembly and essentially lays the groundwork for security forces to use excessive force against protesters with little recourse. Critics of the law fear that it will only serve to further stifle peaceful demonstrations and limit Egyptians' abilities to express their grievances freely and safely. As dissent continues to mount, it remains to be seen whether the Egyptian government will take these concerns into account and consider reviewing or amending the controversial law. Until such time, protests and confrontations with law enforcement are expected to continue and potentially intensify, as citizens are more likely to continue challenging the restrictions on their right to peaceful assembly and free expression."},{"question":"Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Which person studied more about portions of montane grasslands? The answer to this question is:","response":"Alice. Montane grasslands are typically found at high elevations but within lower latitudes, particularly around the equator from 30°N to 20°S. It's a biome characterized by high rainfall, cool temperatures, and specific types of plant species adapted to the cool climate, which includes various grasses and small bushes. Alice's study area falls into this latitude range, so she likely studied more about montane grasslands. On the other hand, Pam's study area (high latitudes of 70 to 50°N) would mostly encompass environments like tundra and boreal forests. Please note that the distribution of biomes like montane grasslands can be influenced by other factors as well, such as elevation, terrain characteristics, and other climate parameters, not just latitude.

One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species, and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Where is sea surface biodiversity the highest?","response":"Sea surface biodiversity is the highest along the coasts in the Western Pacific Ocean. This is because the sea surface temperature is warmest there, which helps lots of different plants and animals live happily and grow in that area."},{"question":"Article: SF’s landmark tower for rich and famous is sinking and tilting The Millennium Tower in San Francisco has sunk 16 inches and tilted 2 inches since it opened in 2008. The Millennium Tower in San Francisco has sunk 16 inches and tilted 2 inches since it opened in 2008. Photo: Michael Noble Jr., The Chronicle Photo: Michael Noble Jr., The Chronicle Image 1 of / 63 Caption Close SF’s landmark tower for rich and famous is sinking and tilting 1 / 63 Back to Gallery The Millennium Tower, a leading symbol of San Francisco’s new high-rise and high-end living, is sinking — setting the stage for what could be one of the most contentious and costly real estate legal battles the city has ever seen. Rated by Worth magazine as one of the top 10 residential buildings in the world, the Millennium at 301 Mission St. is home to such A-listers as Joe Montana and Hunter Pence. Until his recent death, it’s where venture capitalist Tom Perkins owned a penthouse. Condos sell for anywhere from 1.6 million to north of 10 million. However, since its completion in 2008, the 58-story building has sunk 16 inches, according to an independent consultant hired to monitor the problem. It has also tilted 2 inches to the northwest. “That’s significant ... and of concern,” said Professor Greg Deierlein, director of the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford University, who has been called in to evaluate the designs of a couple of San Francisco’s newer downtown high-rises. Deierlein noted that the 88-story Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia — which were the world’s tallest buildings when they opened in 1998 — have sunk less than 3 inches. Their tilt, or “differential settlement,” is less than half an inch. This isn’t just an issue for the Millennium’s owners and wealthy inhabitants: It could be a headache for taxpayers as well. There are potentially big public dollars at stake, with the owners alleging that the massive hole dug next door for the new Transbay Transit Center is to blame for the building’s issues. The problem first came to light in 2010 when the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public agency constructing the transit center, hired the consulting firm Arup to gauge how the excavation could affect the tower. According to the consultant’s initial report, by the time excavation began — two years after the 350 million Millennium was completed — the tower had already settled 10 inches. That was 4 inches more than its builders had predicted for the life of the high-rise. Since then, “the building has continued to settle vertically, now 16 inches,” representatives of the Transbay Joint Powers Authority said in a statement in response to questions from The Chronicle. At the same time, geotechnical reports show that since 2009, the settling has been uneven — resulting in the 2-inch tilt. And while Stanford’s Deierlein doesn’t consider the sink or tilt a safety issue, he did say, “I would be concerned for my investment.” That’s because a shifting building can cause walls to crack, elevators to malfunction and all manner of other annoyances. P.J. Johnston, spokesman for tower builder Millennium Partners and its principal owner, Sean Jeffries, said a nine-month, independent structural safety review in 2014 “determined the settlement has not significantly affected the seismic performance of the building, and does not represent a safety risk.” An attorney for the Millennium homeowners association’s board, John Gill, recently sent a confidential letter to some of the more than 400 residents saying the board was “actively engaged in negotiations with Millennium Partners to resolve building settlement issues.” The letter also said the association was “sensitive to the concerns of everyone about any issue which could impact the value of their units.” In a statement Friday, homeowner representatives said they had “retained a number of engineering consultants to investigate the causes and long-term impact of these settlement conditions” and were evaluating their legal options. They cited any number of parties that could be held “legally accountable” — including the developer, the high-rise’s designers, the contractors and the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which is run by San Francisco, AC Transit, Caltrans and the agency that operates Caltrain. For his part, Millennium spokesman Johnston wasted no time blaming the transit center authority. He insisted that the tower’s settling had been within normal range until excavation began on the bus and rail center next door. “They built a half-mile tunnel 60 feet underground and next to our building, and they were supposed to (protect the Millennium) — and they didn’t,” Johnston said. The authority also signed an agreement with the Millennium developer in 2008 “to repair, at its own cost and expense ... any damage to the development substantially caused by TJPA’s construction activities,” according a copy of the agreement on file at San Francisco City Hall. Records show the Transbay Joint Powers Authority pumped more than 58 million into an underground buttressing system to shore up the Millennium before beginning excavation in 2010. That’s one of the many reasons for the new transit center’s spiraling costs, which are now at 2.4 billion and counting. In its statement, the transit center authority said it “bears no responsibility for the tilt and excessive settlement.” Unlike some downtown high-rises, the Millennium isn’t steel-framed. Instead, the developer chose a concrete design more common to residential buildings. It relies on huge columns, shear walls and beams, and it’s much heavier than steel. What’s more, the building is located on unstable mud-fill, just off the bay’s original shoreline. The Millennium’s engineers anchored the building over a thick concrete slab with piles driven roughly 80 feet into dense sand. “To cut costs, Millennium did not drill piles to bedrock,” or 200 feet down, the transit center authority said in its statement. Had it done so, the agency said, “the tower would not be tilting today.” Johnston countered that “virtually all other buildings in that part of the city have their foundations at the same subterranean level,” citing skyscrapers that include the St. Regis and Intercontinental hotels. He added that the Millennium’s design was state of the art for residential buildings and that concrete can be preferable to steel for several reasons, including sound insulation. “In any case, this was not a cost-saving decision, but the preferred design,” Johnston said. While there have been reports of cracks appearing in the Millennium’s underground garage, there’s no word of residents complaining about damage to their condos. Instead, the shifting and sinking of the concrete platform beneath the building has necessitated what Johnston called “minor repairs to sidewalks and connections at the ground level.” Experts tell us it’s uncertain exactly what, if anything, can be done to fix the problem or straighten the tower. There has been talk of pumping cement underneath the base and drilling new piles — complicated and expensive undertakings. An assessment, no doubt, that offers little comfort to those living in the building. San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.

It has been voted by some as one of the top 10 residential buildings in the world According to an independent consultant hired to monitor the problem, the residential building has sunk 16 inches since its completion in 2008. It has also tilted 2 inches. \\"There are some cracks in the wall in the parking garage and there's been some settling on the club level floor,\\" said Pat Dodson, a Millennium Tower homeowner.One Yelp review noticed windows and a dishwasher getting harder to open and bubbles appearing in the floor.In July, the homeowners' association brought in an engineer. \\"Why the building is sinking and tilting. It's very clear after listening to him and doing a lot of research, which my husband and I have done, that Millennium Partners did not build to bedrock, and that's the cause of the problem,\\" explained Dodson.The owners are pointing the finger at their neighbor. They allege the massive hole dug next door for the new Transbay Transit Center is to blame for the building's issues.A spokesman for Millennium Partners issued a statement saying: \\"All buildings settle over time. 301 Mission has settled more than originally anticipated because it was affected by subsequent construction by others.\\"The Millennium Tower association released a statement saying: \\"It will take all necessary steps to ensure that the buildings are fully repaired and that all parties that caused or contributed to the settlement conditions are held legally accountable.\\"The Transbay Joint Powers Authority responded by saying residents' claims against the TJPA are \\"misplaced\\" as demonstrated by data collected over more than seven years.They went to say, \\"full responsibility for the tilting and excessive settlement of the building lies with Millennium Partners, the developer of the Tower.\\"The TJPA says the 60-story Millennium Tower is made of concrete rather than steel, \\"resulting in a very heavy building.

Friday's report says the military is now in full control of the long contested city. Syrian government forces and their pro-government allies first broke the militant group's siege of their part of the city in September and have been advancing against IS positions since then. Deir el-Zour had been divided into a government-held and an IS-held part for nearly three years. The development is the latest significant defeat for IS as the militant group sees its self-proclaimed \\"caliphate\\" crumble and lose almost all urban strongholds. The Syrian army and Kurdish-led forces backed by the U.S. are now racing to take the rest of the oil-rich eastern province. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'We would rather be killed by IS than be here' - the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria So-called Islamic State (IS) has lost control of two of its last remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Early on Friday Syria's army announced it had taken Deir al-Zour. Later in the day the Iraqi prime minister said al-Qaim, across the border, had been recaptured by government forces. The town was taken \\"in record time\\", PM Haider al-Abadi said. Iraqi forces say they have also seized the last border post between Iraq and Syria that was held by IS. Last month, a US-backed Syrian alliance took control of Raqqa in Syria, the former capital of Islamic State's self-styled \\"caliphate\\". In July, Mosul - Iraq's second-largest city - was taken from IS after months of fighting. The territorial ambitions of IS are now all but destroyed although its ideology remains powerful, says the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher. Why are these losses important? IS had held most of Deir al-Zour since 2014. It was important because of its proximity to the border with Iraq. While the Syrian army said it had been re-captured, other reports said government forces and their allies were clearing the last pockets of resistance from IS in the city. Al-Qaim was the last sizeable territory held by IS in Iraq. The operation to retake the city and the surrounding area was launched last week. Soldiers, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia paramilitary fighters, some backed by Iran, took part in the assault. IS had designated the area on both sides of the border as its \\"Euphrates Province\\" and used it to transfer fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria. The cross-border province was also a symbol of the jihadists' intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to rest the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, an emblem of the colonial division of the area resented by many Arabs.

What territory does IS still control? In Syria, the militant group is now confined to a few pockets in Deir al-Zour province.

An SDF spokesman told the BBC they were still encountering some resistance with the militants using suicide cars and trucks, thermal missiles and mortars. In some towns and villages there was house-to-house fighting, Kino Gabriel said. IS has also suffered a series of defeats in recent months to Iraqi government forces, who are advancing along the Euphrates river on the other side of the border. There are about 1,500 IS fighters left in the area, the US-led coalition fighting IS says. Is this the end for IS?
