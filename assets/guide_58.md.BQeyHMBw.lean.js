He no longer has steady work since the coming of the massive 3 gorges dam that will soon flood his modest home and farm. At least his family has good food from his little field. Daughter can't go on to college because they have no money, so she will work on the cruise boats that go up and down the river with foreign tourists. At first, she struggles and cries, but her supervisors assures her it will get better. Management says that they must train this generation, mostly single children to serve other people. One boy from a rich family finds he can get massive tips from tourists, but his workmates shun him as arrogant, and at the end he is sacked because he does not care enough about his customers or co-workers who say he carries himself like a movie star, not someone who show up to work.

The dam is forcing them to leave their river-side home and farm, which has led to her father losing his steady work. Cindy's decision to work on the cruise boats is her attempt to help her family financially and adapt to the changes occurring in their lives due to the dam project."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"If I someone needs emergency relief what service could benefit them?\\" is in \\"African Presbyterian churches often incorporate diaconal ministries, including social services, emergency relief, and the operation of mission hospitals.

Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth. Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.

Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 22:13 EST, 6 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 16:42 EST, 7 October 2012. The death toll has risen to seven from a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has been linked to spinal steroid injections, sparking fear as new cases have been reported in nine U.S. states. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, that has sickened 64 people, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) The latest fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths until after the weekend. The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs. Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee. hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical. treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across. the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The injectable steroids responsible. for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a. specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 64 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak. could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy. involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has. recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of. the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections. An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported. Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths. Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota. Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid. Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very. seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan. said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the. meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found. the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center. released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to. discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist. Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company. web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the. state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the. broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable. products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of. four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease. producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave. reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock. That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act.

So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). Question: \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\" Answer: \\"Ruler and subject\\" Is this answer correct?","response":"Yes, the answer is correct, but it is incomplete. Confucius emphasized several hierarchical and dictatorial relationships, including ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, and the individual and the state. Confucius believed that if these relationships were not properly maintained and respected, it would result in negative consequences for individuals, families, and entire nations. Disobedience or defying the established order would lead to disasters and chaos in society."},{"question":"Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface.

If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave.

Given the sentence \\"A man looks intently at the camera as he is holding a knife to butcher some meat.\\" can we conclude that \\"A butcher is getting his picture taken.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"1. The given sentence states, \\"A man looks intently at the camera as he is holding a knife to butcher some meat.\\" 2. We know that a man is looking at the camera while holding a knife. 3. The man is planning to butcher meat, so we can infer that he might be a butcher or at least participating in a task that a butcher would do. 4. The sentence doesn't explicitly mention that a photo is being taken, but it does say the man is looking intently at the camera, which suggests that a photo might be taken or a recording is being made.

Translate to Romanian","response":"Domnule Președinte, doamnelor și domnilor, pentru a aborda problema ocupării forței de muncă într-un mod constructiv, trebuie să existe trei cuvinte-cheie pentru acțiunea UE: a reacționa, a evolua, a proteja. Pentru a aborda în mod constructiv problema șomajului, este esențial să fie adoptate măsuri eficiente la nivelul Uniunii Europene. În acest sens, ar trebui să ne bazăm pe trei principii fundamentale: reacție, evoluție și siguranță. În primul rând, este necesar ca Uniunea Europeană să reacționeze rapid și eficient la provocările legate de ocuparea forței de muncă. Asta presupune adoptarea unor politici coerente și solide, menite să încurajeze crearea de locuri de muncă și să reducă efectele negative ale șomajului asupra populației. De asemenea, este important să se ia în considerare atât nevoile angajaților, cât și ale angajatorilor, pentru a atinge un echilibru echitabil în piața muncii. Al doilea principiu, evoluția, subliniază importanța adaptabilității UE la schimbările socio-economice și tehnologice. Acest lucru înseamnă că este necesar să se pună un accent deosebit pe dezvoltarea competențelor și pe educație, precum și să se investească în inovare, cercetare și dezvoltare pentru a menține competitivitatea economiilor europene. De asemenea, trebuie să se țină cont de noile modele de muncă care decurg din revoluția digitală și să se analizeze impactul acestora asupra forței de muncă în întreaga UE. În sfârșit, principalul obiectiv al tuturor acțiunilor întreprinse trebuie să fie protejarea și siguranță forței de muncă în ansamblu. Asta implică garantarea unor drepturi și condiții de muncă echitabile pentru toți lucrătorii europeni și promovarea de politici care să vizeze reducerea inegalităților sociale și economice. Pe lângă politici sociale și economice solide, trebuie să se asigure accesul la o protecție socială adecvată pentru grupurile vulnerabile precum tinerii, vârstnicii și migranții. În concluzie, abordarea problemei ocupării forței de muncă la nivelul Uniunii Europene necesită o strategie coerentă și multidimensională. Prin unirea sub umbrela celor trei cuvinte-cheie - a reacționa, a evolua și a proteja - UE poate face pași importanți pentru a face față provocărilor viitoare în domeniul ocupării forței de muncă și pentru a construi o societate mai incluzivă și solidară pentru toți cetățenii săi."},{"question":"Build a movie plot around this: Who plays a prank on the queen?

The picture showed the journalist wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to shield herself from the sun's rays. This seemingly innocent act, however, sparked an unexpected controversy, leading to her suspension. In this article, we will explore the incident, the reasons behind her suspension, and public reactions. The Incident The Chinese television journalist in question works for a local Chinese news network. In the photograph, she can be seen wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to protect herself from the sweltering sun while reporting outdoors. According to reports, the image was captured by a passerby and subsequently posted online, where it garnered significant attention and quickly went viral. Reasons for Suspension On one hand, one could argue that the journalist was simply following standard safety protocols while outdoors to protect herself from the harmful ultraviolet rays. Sunglasses and umbrellas or parasols have been used for centuries as a means of protection from the sun, and their use is especially prevalent in places with high temperatures and direct sunlight. On the other hand, some critics argue that her actions were unbefitting of a professional news reporter. They claim that her use of sunglasses and an umbrella while on duty might give people the impression that she is not serious about her job, or that it distracts viewers from her reporting. Furthermore, these critics believe that a journalist on air should abide by a certain level of professionalism and decorum in terms of appearance, which her actions seemingly jeopardized. It is important to note that the Chinese media industry adheres to strict regulations, and there have been previous instances where news anchors or reporters have been suspended or even fired for violating these guidelines. In this context, the journalist's employer may have wanted to avoid any potential backlash or controversy by taking measures against her behavior. Public Reaction The incident has drawn mixed reactions from the public. Many people on social media have come out in support of the suspended journalist, stating that her actions were not inappropriate or unprofessional. They argue that she was simply taking care of her health while working outdoors and claim that the suspension was unjust. Others, however, believe that the employer's decision was warranted. They argue that a professional journalist should maintain a certain level of appearance and that protecting oneself from the sun could have been achieved privately without having to appear on camera with sunglasses and an umbrella. These individuals assert that the journalist's behavior could potentially compromise the credibility of her reporting and the overall reputation of the news network. Conclusion In conclusion, the suspension of a Chinese television journalist for wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella while reporting outdoors has sparked a significant debate on professionalism and expectations within the media industry. While some have criticized her actions, many others defend her right to protect her health and well-being in a public space. This incident raises crucial questions about the evolving roles and expectations of journalists in an increasingly public-facing profession."},{"question":"The Augustalia was a festival celebreated in honor of a man that had what name at birth?","response":"The Augustalia festival was celebrated in honor of the man named Gaius Octavius Thurinus at birth. Born on September 23, 63 BC, Gaius Octavius was the adopted son of Gaius Julius Caesar, who posthumously designated him as his political heir. Following Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, Octavius rose to power and, after a series of civil wars and political maneuvers, emerged as the sole ruler of the Roman Empire. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate awarded him the title \\"Augustus,\\" which can be translated into English as \\"the Illustrious One\\" or \\"the Venerable One.\\" With this bestowed title, Gaius Octavius became Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus, signifying that he was the son of a deified Caesar and thus solidifying his dominance. The Augustalia festival was instituted in 19 or 18 BC by the Roman Senate in honor of Emperor Augustus, celebrating his accomplishments and devotion to the state. The primary aim of the festival was to acknowledge Augustus's authority and magnify his prestige. It took place on October 12th, coinciding with the final day of the lustrum, a Roman ceremony of purification, and the anniversary of Augustus's dedication of the Temple of Mars Ultor. Festivities during Augustalia included lavish sacrifices, games, entertainments, and public banquets, which both the masses and the elite could partake in. The festival allowed Romans to express their loyalty and gratitude to Augustus and the Julian family. Moreover, it reinforced the image of the deified emperor and enhanced the notion of imperial worship, which eventually became an important part of the Roman imperial cult. Throughout Emperor Augustus's reign, the Augustalia festival grew in size and grandeur, serving as a yearly reminder of his continued domination and accomplishments. After Augustus's death in AD 14, the festival persisted as a state-sponsored event to honor the memory of Rome's first emperor and the broader Julio-Claudian dynasty."},{"question":"- source is http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/579109.html cricinfo - international is true - country is singapore - batting is right-handed - birth date is 3 may 1990 - date is 1990 5 3 yes Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Add 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of marble dust to the bucket and stir with a mixing rod or a wooden stick. You can get a wooden stick free at any paint store. Step 5: With the lime putty already in the bucket, adding the marble dust will create the main base for Venetian plaster. It is crucial to integrate these two ingredients properly to achieve the desired consistency and texture. Step 6: Use a mixing rod or a wooden stick to mix the lime putty and marble dust thoroughly. Ensuring there are no lumps or dry patches will result in a smoother and more uniform final product. Step 7: Once the lime putty and marble dust have been combined effectively, continue to mix vigorously until the mixture reaches a smooth, creamy consistency. Step 8: Optional, but advisable, is to add a tinted colorant to the plaster mixture according to your design preference. Gradually add the colorant while stirring continuously until you reach the desired color. Step 9: Apply the Venetian plaster to the desired surface using a steel trowel or spatula. Spread it evenly and thinly over the area, applying multiple layers if required. Make sure each layer dries completely before applying the next. This will give the plaster depth and texture, which is characteristic of Venetian plaster. Step 10: Once the final layer of plaster has dried, use a clean, slightly damp trowel to burnish the surface. This will remove any remaining imperfections and give the wall a glossy finish.

UPDATED:. 06:36 EST, 30 November 2012. A small bronze sculpture that was dismissed as a 'humble' paperweight for decades has been confirmed as an £80,000 Barbara Hepworth. The 1965 work, called Oval Form, sat on the headteacher's desk at St Ives School for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well. But was revealed as 'probably the most expensive paperweight in the world' by stunned experts on BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday. The £80,000 sculpture Oval Form, pictured, was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world's most expensive paperweights. David Harris, St Ives School head, said the paperweight would not leave the school in Cornwall, despite its value. He said: 'It's sitting on my desk so it's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world. Dame Barbara Hepworth, pictured, was a governor at St Ives School in Cornwall and gave the sculpture as a gift. She died in 1975. 'We have links to the art scene because we live and work in St Ives so we knew it was valuable but we'd not had it valued. We didn't know it was that valuable. 'Not that it is of any consequence because it's the school's and it will remain the school's. It's a fabulous piece of work and it's something which we do treasure.' Mr Harris said Oval Form was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift. It was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term. St Ives School librarian Jan Wardman took the 'paperweight' to show experts on the popular BBC show in Falmouth and beamed as she was told the news. Visibly excited Rupert Maas, an expert in ceramics and glass, told the show: 'It's by Barbara Hepworth. 'This is English Modernism, you know, you cannot confuse it with anything else. 'It is very tactile and made of bronze. It's worth £60,000 to £80,000. And it's a very important thing. It's a seriously exciting find. 'There's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles. 'It's easy to forget that here in Cornwall we're actually at the cutting edge of Modernism really. Barbara Hepworth was really at the forefront of British Modernism.' Tourists flock to St Ives to see Barbara Hepworth's large bronze Modernist sculptures in the Hepworth Memorial Garden. Another sculpture sits outside the. Guildhall, home to St Ives Town Council but this smaller example of her. work is not widely known. TV antiques expert Rupert Maas, pictured, described the piece as a 'seriously exciting find' and said it was worth up to £80,000. The staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school, who expected it to be worth considerably less. Mr Harris added: 'It's not something we let out of our sight now. 'The guy on Antiques Roadshow said it will be in the upper reaches because it's such a beautiful domestic piece. 'For them it was a significant find. It did look lovely on the television with the light catching it. It is beautiful and a very tactile piece.'

The government now wants to build on that number with a view to attracting astronomers from all over the planet. The Milky Way must be clearly visible to qualify as a dark sky site. The chairman of the Isle of Man Astronomical Society, Howard Parkin said: \\"Sites must be clear of light pollution, provide good sightlines of the sky and have good public access.\\". \\"All sites must have the approval of the relevant landowner,\\" he added. Mr Parkin is working with the government on the plan and believes the island could have dozens of suitable locations. The island's seven sites mean it already has the largest concentration of dark sky sites in Britain. The areas already recognised by the Dark Sky Association include Smeale Nature Reserve, Niarbyl and The Sound. Other areas that have been awarded the status are Port Soderick Brooghs, Axnfell Plantation Fort Island and Sulby Reservoir Car Park. The classification is given to promote astronomy and energy efficiency. A tourism spokesman said the development of specialist niche markets to attract high-spending visitors is a cornerstone of their current strategy. According to government figures visitor spending increased by more than 5% in 2012 to Â£103m, with spending by leisure visitors up by 14% to Â£47.7m. Mr Parkin added: \\"The beauty of the island is that it has very little light pollution. There are no motorways or large built up areas, so as a consequence you only have to drive a little way to find a dark sky site and enjoy the splendour of the night sky. \\"We are the only place which has seven locations in one area. The Isles Scilly have got five nominated sites but we already have seven approved and to be quite honest we could have 27. We have some of the clearest skies in Europe.\\" For the project to go ahead at least 15 more sites will need to obtain the status from the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. People have until 31 July to submit their suggestions. Summary:","response":"In October last year, seven island sites in the Isle of Man were granted dark sky status by an international body that recognizes the best stargazing locations around the world. The Isle of Man government now aims to increase the number of dark sky sites to attract astronomers globally.

Experts estimate that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health.

It is a classic cocktail with a history that traces back to the late 19th or early 20th century, and it is very similar to the well-known Martini. A standard Gibson recipe consists of the following ingredients: 1. Gin - Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage primarily made from juniper berries and other botanicals. It traces its origins to the Middle Ages and has since become a popular and versatile base spirit in many cocktails. In a Gibson, a London Dry Gin is often suggested, but you can use any gin that suits your taste preferences. 2. Dry Vermouth - Dry Vermouth is a fortified and aromatized wine. Just like gin, various botanicals and herbs are added to the base wine, which is then fortified typically with a grape-based spirit. The dry, slightly bitter taste of vermouth helps to balance the richness of the gin, giving the Gibson its classic flavor profile. 3. Cocktail Onion - The key difference between a Gibson and a Martini is the garnish. While Martinis typically use olives or a lemon twist, a Gibson is garnished with a cocktail onion. The cocktail onion adds a distinct, slightly sweet and savory flavor to the drink, setting it apart from other similar cocktails. Here's a basic recipe for making a Gibson: Ingredients: - 2.5 oz (75 ml) gin - 0.5 oz (15 ml) dry vermouth - 1 or 2 cocktail onions for garnish Instructions: 1. Fill a mixing glass with ice. 2. Pour the gin and dry vermouth over the ice. 3. Stir the ingredients well for 20-30 seconds; this not only combines the ingredients but also chills and dilutes the mixture slightly. 4. Using a strainer, pour the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. 5. Garnish the drink with one or two cocktail onions, either on a cocktail skewer or dropped into the glass. The Gibson is typically served \\"up\\" in a chilled cocktail glass, but you can also serve it \\"on the rocks\\" in a rocks glass. As an alternative, you can experiment with different garnishes or even add a bar spoon of the onion brine to the drink to enhance its flavor further. The Gibson is a classy and timeless cocktail that has truly stood the test of time, and gin remains its iconic spirit."},{"question":"Puţini anticipează însă un viitor care să includă menţinerea OHR.

Exploring these possibilities may result in abrupt changes in self-presentation as the adolescent chooses or rejects qualities and behaviors, trying to guide the actual self toward the ideal self (who the adolescent wishes to be) and away from the feared self (who the adolescent does not want to be). For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How can the feared self be described in terms of the adolescent?","response":"The feared self can be described in terms of the adolescent as a version of themselves that they are actively trying to avoid becoming. This could be a result of personal limitations, negative influences, or undesirable outcomes in their lives. The feared self may embody traits, behaviors, or goals that are incompatible with the adolescent's values, aspirations, or desired identity.

From start to finish, every aspect of our visit was top-notch; from the warm hospitality extended by the thoughtful staff to the mouth-watering dishes that graced our table. Upon entering The Food Symphony, we were immediately struck by the cozy and relaxed ambiance of the restaurant, which was complemented by the low hum of cheerful conversations and the soft, ambient lighting. The host greeted us with a friendly smile and promptly seated us at a lovely table with a beautiful view of their quaint patio. As we perused the menu, I couldn't help but appreciate the range of delectable options available. The Food Symphony offers something for everyone, even catering to special dietary requirements such as vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options. Our server showed great knowledge of the menu and was able to make excellent suggestions based on our preferences. We started with the house-made focaccia bread with a divine blend of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The taste was heavenly, as the warm and fluffy bread melted in our mouths. For appetizers, we tried the spicy shrimp ceviche and the ricotta-stuffed mushrooms. The ceviche was a perfect blend of spiciness and tang, with the shrimp marinated to perfection, while the mushrooms were tender, flavorful, and bursting with creaminess from the ricotta. For our main course, we opted for the pan-seared Chilean Sea Bass with garlic-lemon butter sauce and the Short Rib Ravioli accompanied by a porcini mushroom cream sauce. The sea bass was flaky and succulent, cooked to perfection with a delectable butter sauce that enhanced every bite. The ravioli was a true work of art, generously filled with melt-in-your-mouth short rib and bathing in a rich and flavorful mushroom sauce. By the time dessert rolled around, we could hardly fathom fitting more food into our satisfied stomachs. But, our server enticed us with the description of the chef's signature Tiramisu, so we had to try it - and we had absolutely zero regrets. With just the right balance of coffee and rich Mascarpone, the tiramisu sent our taste buds on an unforgettable journey. The whole experience was further enhanced by the exceptional attention to detail and attentive service from the staff. The pace of the meal was perfect, allowing us to savor each dish without feeling rushed. The servers regularly checked in to ensure we had everything we needed and promptly refilled our drinks when necessary. In conclusion, the flavors, textures, and presentation of each dish were simply outstanding. The Food Symphony made for an enjoyable, memorable evening, and I cannot wait until my next visit. If you're looking for a fantastic culinary treat, I highly recommend adding The Food Symphony to your must-try list!"},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to French: Aviva submitted that the CCRA paid for these 33,000 new product licences via the guise of maintenance renewal.","response":"Aviva a soumis que la CCRA a payé pour ces 33 000 nouvelles licences de produit sous le couvert du renouvellement de la maintenance."},{"question":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Violet is interested in the book Frankie is reading.

The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, a record executive in the 1970s. It premiered on HBO on February 14, 2016, and concluded on April 17, 2016. What's the best answer to this question: is the show vinyl based on a true story?","response":"\\"Vinyl\\" is not explicitly based on a true story but it does draw heavily from the world of 1970s rock 'n' roll as informed by the real-life experiences and observations of its creators, especially Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger. The show's main character, Richie Finestra, portrayed by Bobby Cannavale, is a fictional character and his story, including his struggles with addiction and his turbulent personal life, is not based on any one individual's real life. Instead, he is a fictional amalgamation conceived by “Vinyl” co-creators, Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen, and Terence Winter for the purposes of the series. The backdrop of the show, however, is rooted in a very real era. The series takes place in the 1970s, a time noted for its vibrant music scene and particularly, the explosive growth and evolution of rock 'n' roll. Martin Scorsese, acclaimed film director, is known for his meticulous period details and in \\"Vinyl,\\" he reconjures the decade with his signature flair. Mick Jagger, legendary frontman of The Rolling Stones, provided the insider view of the 70s music industry. Jagger’s own experiences as a musician during this time period influenced the atmosphere and characters seen in the show. Also showcased in the series are representations of real-life artists and bands of the era, like Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and The Velvet Underground, among others. These characters, however, are primarily used to accurately signify the music trends and culture of the era, rather than having their individual stories told. Moreover, while the American Century record company is depicted as a powerhouse in the music industry, it is crucial to remember that it is not based on a single real-life record company. The series instead depicts a cultural composite of record companies during the 70s period, marked by cutthroat competition, indulgence, and innovation. So, while \\"Vinyl\\" uses real-life elements and experiences to build its world, it is essential to view it as a creative dramatization, rather than an accurate historical account. The facts of the music industry in the 1970s serve more as inspiration and backdrop as opposed to being faithfully duplicated for the sake of retelling a specific true story. It's more truthful to say that \\"Vinyl\\" is influenced by true events and surroundings rather than based on one."},{"question":"This is some data: Antares (rocket), manufacturer, Yuzhnoye Design Office; Antares (rocket), finalFlight, 2014-07-13; Antares (rocket), maidenFlight, 2013-04-21; Antares (rocket), launchSite, Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0; Antares (rocket), diameter, 3.9 (metres).

Daniel Rodriquez jailed for a total of 12 years after an armed siege at his home in Kidlington, Oxon, in July last year. A man who took a cocktail of drugs before holding his two-year-old twin girls hostage in an armed siege was jailed for 12 years today. Daniel Rodriquez, 38, from Kidlington, Oxon, armed himself with an air rifle and an imitation handgun as his daughters slept in their beds following a domestic incident on July 9 last year. More than 50 officers in riot gear and. armed with guns surrounded the family flat in the early hours of the morning. The man twice fired at police as dozens of officers filled the streets for the pro-longed stand off. Rodriquez took a cocktail of. drugs including heroin, crack cocaine and valium while the police were. outside frantically trying to negotiate the children’s release, a court heard. Rodriquez was later restrained by officers with a Taser after the girls - wearing matching pyjamas - were carried from the property by police. The man pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. Rodriquez was sentenced to 12 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today. Prosecutor Rachel Drake described the terrifying siege to the court. Miss Drake said: 'There was cordoning off of the areas and a very long siege situation involving negotiations between the defendant and the police. 'He was in a very agitated and distressed state and said he was considering taking his own life. 'Police were extremely concerned about the safety of the twin girls asleep in the bedroom next to the defendant. 'As the incident developed, the police were negotiating with Mr Rodriquez. About 9.30am, having supplied him with some food he passed down one of the girls. 'At 11.30am, the second of the children was passed through the window. There was no suggestion they were harmed during this incident.' An officer holds one of the man's daughters in his arms and takes her to safety following the siege. Despite handing over his children, the gunman still refused to come out of the flat. Miss Drake continued: 'Mr Rodriquez was not prepared to give himself up to the police for many hours afterwards. His arrest eventually took place in the foyer of the flat at 3.50pm. 'Following the defendant’s arrest, a full search was made of the flat and the two firearms were recovered.' The guns were found to be a .177 calibre air rifle and an imitation Colt Python handgun. Rodriquez appeared in court via a video link in prison wearing a navy and white hooped jumper. He stared forward blankly during the sentencing hearing and only spoke to confirm his name. At the time of his arrest, the father ran his own car wash firm Ace Power Wash Services in Kidlington, Oxon. One of the twins is removed from the property by an officer. The girls were wearing matching pyjamas as they were taken to safety. The court heard he had served six months in prison in 2002 for racially aggravated common assault, and had a string of convictions for theft, burglary, drug possession and ABH. His most recent conviction was for burglary and theft in 2011. In mitigation, his defence counsel Lucy Tapper said her client suffered mental health problems - including bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorder. She told the judge that Rodriquez loved his children and never intended them any harm during the hostage crisis. She said: 'The devastating cocktail of drugs and alcohol Mr Rodriquez had consumed, coupled with his overwhelming sense of anxiety and paranoia caused him to react in the way he did that morning when great numbers of police arrived at his house. 'The children were never, ever put in any direct danger by him. He had got them up in the usual way, got them breakfast and had them watching television. One officer reports hearing them laughing and playing in the back room.' Armed officers surround the flat in Kidlington. Rodriguez twice fired at police during the siege. Judge Ian Pringle commented that it was an 'appalling' case and said Rodriquez’s possession of the firearms was an 'aggravating factor' in the case. Jailing Rodriquez for 12 years, the judge said: 'Police staked out the house you were in with your two very small daughters. You released them one by one. 'That siege lasted until just before 4pm that afternoon - a serious aggravating feature of this case, no doubt brought about by your taking of a lethal cocktail of drugs over a huge period of time.' Rodriquez had pleaded guilty to possession of two firearms and two counts of using the firearms to resist arrest. For those counts, he received four years in jail. He was also jailed for eight years to run concurrently after he admitted three counts of rape and one sexual assault charge against a woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Jim Homes, the investigating officer from Thames Valley Police said he was 'satisfied' with the result of what was a 'very difficult' investigation. 'It was a very unusual case, not one that we’ve dealt with before,' he added. Rodriguez was sentenced to 12 years in jail today following the incident in July last year.

This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"The concept of \\"standing still\\" refers to the visual phenomenon where the rotational speed of the turntable and the frequency of the strobe lines match, making it appear as though the lines on the strobe disc are stationary. This effect is used to accurately set the correct rotational speed of the turntable, ensuring optimal playback and sound quality. In the given context, we are considering a 78.26 rpm turntable speed, which was achieved with a 46:1 gear ratio using a synchronous turntable motor that ran at 3600 rpm. To determine the number of lines needed to create the \\"stand still\\" effect in a 60 Hz light (common in countries where 60 Hz is the standard electric current frequency), we can use the following formula: Number of lines = (Turntable speed) / (Frequency of alternating current) Given the data, we are considering a turntable speed of 78.26 rpm and a 60 Hz frequency for the electric current: Number of lines = 78.26 / 60 Number of lines ≈ 1.304 However, we need to consider the number of lines as an integer, so we should choose the nearest whole number. In this case, the nearest whole number is 1. Consequently, it would not be feasible to create a strobe disc with just one line to create the \\"standing still\\" effect for an rpm of 78.26 with 60 Hz light. Therefore, a strobe disk would need to have a higher number of lines, for example, 92 lines, as mentioned in the context. For a 50 Hz light setting, the standard 77.92 rpm (achieved using a 77:2 ratio) would require 77 lines for the strobe disc to \\"stand still\\". However, if you still wanted to adjust for a turntable speed of 78.26 rpm, you would use the formula as above: Number of lines = 78.26 / 50 Number of lines ≈ 1.565 In this case, the nearest whole number is 2. Thus, a strobe disc would need 2 lines to \\"stand still\\" when using a turntable speed of 78.26 rpm in a setting with 50 Hz light. It's essential to note that the lower the number of lines on the strobe disc, the lower the accuracy in setting the correct turntable speed. Hence, using a higher number of lines would provide better accuracy and better sound quality."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on carolyn bessette-kennedy 's: - death place - birth name - death date - spouse - education - birth date - name - occupation - image - birth place - religion - alma mater Bio: carolyn jeanne bessette-kennedy -lrb- january 7 , 1966july 16 , 1999 -rrb- was a former publicist for calvin klein and the wife of john f. kennedy jr. , the son of u.s. president john f. kennedy and jacqueline kennedy onassis . upon her marriage , bessette-kennedy 's relationship with her husband and her fashion sense became the subject of intense media scrutiny and she drew comparisons to her mother-in-law jacqueline kennedy onassis . the couple , along with bessette-kennedy 's older sister lauren , died in a plane crash off the coast of martha 's vineyard in july 1999 .","response":"Based on the provided bio, I can give the following details about Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy: - Death place: A plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard - Birth name: Carolyn Jeanne Bessette - Death date: July 16, 1999 - Spouse: John F.

All snakes may bite if provoked, but some pack more of a punch and are venomous. It can be hard for someone without an expertise in snakes to tell from only looking at a snake, so proceed with caution. If you suspect that a snake is venomous, do not try to catch it with your hands. Some of the most common U.S. based venomous snakes are: Copperhead snakes. These are found most commonly in the eastern and mid-southern states. They get their name from unique copper colored scales on their head that slowly fade throughout the rest of their body.Their markings are often triangular in shape. Cottonmouth snake.These are usually four to seven feet in length. They are generally a dark shade of brown or a dull black. They have pupils that are shaped like slits and have a bulky body. They are found predominantly in the southern U.S., throughout Florida and the Mississippi River region. Diamondback Rattlesnake. These can grow up ten feet long. They are recognized by their distinctive black or brown diamond patterns down their bodies outlined in a light shade of yellow. They are a rattlesnake, and as that name implies, they have a series of hollow segments on the end of their tale that create a rattle sound when its shook. They live in the southern and south western parts of the U.S. and some of Mexico. Coral snake. These snakes can be difficult to recognize since it resembles other similar species. They are found in the eastern, southwestern, and southeastern portions of the U.S. They can grow to be around thirty inches. They are universally a red-yellow-black-yellow pattern with black heads. They are venomous, so you should be very careful if you think you spot one. Catching a snake by hand is a little trickier, and should be done with caution. However, if you do not have any tools or nets handy, you can catch a snake using your hands. Use an object to distract the snake's head, like a stick. Firmly grasp its tail and lift the snake upwards, leaving the front part of its body on the ground, but keeping your legs and body as far away as possible. Place the snake in a pillow case or sack immediately. If you know how to safely approach a snake, you can also grab the snake by the back of head to neutralize its chances of biting you. However, getting so close to the snake's head can be risky. If you use this method, it may be best to have a tool, such as a snake fork, that can pin the head down before you reach for it. Besides the risk of biting, snakes can also carry harmful bacteria. Make sure to use gloves to prevent your risk of catching a bacterial infection from the snake. If you do not have gloves, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after touching the snake. Do not handle food or touch anyone else before you have washed your hands thoroughly.

They were frequently criticized by nobles who feared the possibility of an environment in which class and its accompanying titles and privileges were disregarded. Such an environment was especially intimidating to monarchs who derived much of their power from the disparity between classes of people. If classes were to join together under the influence of Enlightenment thinking, they might recognize the all-encompassing oppression and abuses of their monarchs and, because of their size, might be able to carry out successful revolts. Monarchs also resented the idea of their subjects convening as one to discuss political matters, especially those concerning foreign affairs - rulers thought political affairs to be their business only, a result of their supposed divine right to rule.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking mitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the protein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element. Erythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6). Since they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as you will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the...

Organized by the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), primarily under the leadership of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, the parade aimed to garner attention, raise awareness, and build support for women's right to vote. The purpose of the Woman Suffrage Procession can be broken down into several key objectives: 1. Raise awareness for the suffrage movement: The parade, held on March 3, 1913, was designed to be a grand spectacle, attracting thousands of participants and onlookers. With marchers from various states and backgrounds, the event aimed to convey the broad support and nationwide appeal of the women's suffrage movement. 2. Demonstrate political power: By organizing the parade the day before President Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, the suffragists sought to demonstrate their political prowess. By having a high-profile event coincide with the start of a new presidential term, they hoped to send a clear message to the incoming administration of the importance of the suffrage movement and the need for action on the federal level. 3. Appeal to the masses: The parade was an opportunity to present the movement in an accessible and engaging way. Participants dressed in white, the color commonly associated with the suffrage movement, and were joined by floats, bands, and other theatrical elements, drawing attention from the press and public. Additionally, with well-known figures such as lawyer Inez Milholland leading the parade, the suffragists aimed to gain a wider audience for their cause. 4. Unify the movement: The Woman Suffrage Procession brought together a diverse group of women from different regions, political affiliations, and social backgrounds. This diversity was an essential aspect of the movement that helped to dispel the myth that women's suffrage only appealed to a minority of the population. The parade helped showcase the inclusive and collaborative spirit of the movement and endeavored to create a sense of unity among the various suffrage organizations and activists. 5. Expose injustices: The Woman Suffrage Procession was not without challenges. Parade participants encountered hostility, jeering, and even violence from the crowd. Police provided little assistance, and the situation became so dangerous that soldiers had to be called in to protect the marchers. This mistreatment of the participants was widely reported in the press, helping to expose the hypocrisy and injustice women faced as they campaigned for their right to vote. This negative experience further galvanized the movement and rallied supporters around the need for change. In summary, the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, D.C. in March 1913 aimed to increase awareness, demonstrate political power, appeal to the masses, unify the suffrage movement, and expose injustices faced by women. The event, despite the challenges encountered, was successful in gaining public support and attention for the movement, contributing to women's eventual achievement of the right to vote through the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920."},{"question":"In signing Argentina's same-sex marriage law, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said debate over the issue would be \\"absolutely anachronistic\\" -- archaic, out of date -- within a few years. Striking down California's Proposition 8 two weeks later, Judge Vaughn Walker was more specific, saying there was no evidence for old-fashioned stereotypes that painted gays \\"as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality.\\" Banning people from marrying based on sexual orientation, the President Reagan appointee explained, is \\"irrational.\\" \\"Often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now,\\" said Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book, \\"Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans' Definitions of Family.\\" As Walker indicated, attitudes are changing, and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children, defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society. \\"Public attitudes don't change really quickly, but this is one that's changing really, really quickly,\\" Powell said. The trend is similar abroad, especially among younger people, said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who heads the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including Jamaica, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Ivory Coast. Research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as \\"benign variation, so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting,\\" Goldberg said in an e-mail. \\"Once that happens, societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples,\\" she added. Before 2008, Massachusetts (via a court ruling) was the only U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada and South Africa were the only countries. Since then, four U.S. states, five countries, Washington, D.C., and Mexico City have legalized same-sex marriage. Watch why same-sex marriages are on hold in California. While some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights, some may appear more curious. South Africa resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights, and in some African countries same-sex relationships are punishable by penal labor, flogging, imprisonment or death, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association. Mexico City, Portugal and Argentina, all of which legalized same-sex marriage this year -- and Spain, which OK'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly Catholic, and the church has made clear its aversion to same-sex relationships. Goldberg said she believes, in the Catholic countries, the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality. \\"My sense is that the shift in the Catholic countries to recognize same sex-couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been, in some nations, an indication of the church's shrinking political clout,\\" she said. Argentina may fit the bill, as the country is 92 percent Roman Catholic, yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing. Watch couple comment on Argentina's first same-sex marriage. A recent CNN poll said Americans were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. Proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, but Powell noted referendums \\"do not necessarily reflect the will of the people.\\" Older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks, he said, and heated issues draw special interests into elections, which can skew demographics. Powell has been collecting data on American attitudes since 2003. While the full data will be released in his book in September, his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers: Though many Americans simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families, 80 percent of Americans consider gay partners a family if they have children. His research shows American definitions of family are becoming flexible, he said, likening the same-sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision authorizing interracial marriages. Before the miscegenation ruling, researchers found younger people, those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages. Similar lines hold true in today's same-sex marriage debate. Powell added another variable: gender. Women have a \\"more inclusive\\" definition of family, he said. Goldberg said demographics were also at play in other nations, \\"reaching a tipping point\\" on same-sex couples. These societies have had long-standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work, in courts and elsewhere, she said. iReport.com: 'Army of lovers' fights for rights. There is also \\"an increased demand by same-sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion-based reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marriage,\\" she said. The more open discourse on a topic, the more acceptance it garners, Goldberg and Powell concurred. Look to the tube. When Ellen DeGeneres kissed Laura Dern on her sitcom, \\"Ellen,\\" in 1997, there was enormous backlash. Today, same-sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters, such as \\"Modern Family\\" and \\"Glee,\\" are up for Emmys this month. \\"Once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases, as a result of media representations, people become more comfortable,\\" Powell said. Added Goldberg, \\"It's also true that as gay people live openly and as same-sex couples' relationships are recognized more broadly, fears that the sky will fall because of same-sex couples' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream.\\" Change is not swift everywhere, as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut. Read Time.com's history of international gay marriage. In 2008, the U.N. General Assembly saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians, yet a 2010 International Lesbian and Gay Association report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation. The number last year was 77. India dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in July 2009. \\"One country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress, until one realizes that it hosts one-sixth of the human population,\\" the report said. There are countries such as Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior, according to the report. There are places such as Aruba and Israel that will recognize same-sex marriages but won't perform them. There are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions. Goldberg said policies in Uganda, which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment, and in Iran are stark contrasts to the rest of the world, which is reluctant to condemn gays openly. As for countries embracing civil unions, it's a compromise, Powell said. People are in favor of many gay rights, just not marriage, he said. Goldberg described it as \\"typically political, where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same-sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community.\\" To those fighting for gay rights, Powell said, any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people's comfort levels. \\"Contact makes things less scary, makes it more comfortable, and the more comfort you have the less opposition you're going to have,\\" he said. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","response":"1. Argentina's President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner signed the same-sex marriage law and discussed how the debate on the issue would soon be considered outdated. 2. Judge Vaughn Walker struck down California's Proposition 8, highlighting the need for evidence-based discussions rather than relying on old-fashioned stereotypes. 3. Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor, suggests that court decisions often predict public opinions in a few years and attitudes towards homosexuality are changing quickly. 4. Younger people are increasingly seeing sexual orientation as a benign variation, with less interest in differentiating between gay and nongay couples. 5. Since 2008, more U.S. states and countries have legalized same-sex marriage, indicating a growing global trend. 6. In some Catholic countries, the drive for equality trumps religious considerations, leading to the legalization of same-sex marriage. 7. Poll data and research show that attitudes towards same-sex couples as families are shifting, with more acceptance when children are involved. 8. Similar demographics and factors affect attitudes towards both interracial marriage and same-sex marriage, with openness to discourse increasing acceptance. 9. Television and media representations of gay relationships and characters are helping to normalize and encourage open discussions. 10. Progress may be slow, but increasing dialogue and comfort levels are vital in promoting acceptance and change in attitudes towards same-sex marriage."},{"question":"Continue writing the following text. Dennis uses Facebook all the time, but Benjamin is kind of against social media.","response":"Dennis, an avid Facebook user, considers the platform his primary means of keeping up with the latest news, trends, and updates from his friends and loved ones. He frequently posts status updates, photos, and shares interesting articles or thought-provoking ideas with his followers. In addition, Dennis utilizes Facebook's various features such as Groups and Events to foster his social and professional connections. The platform offers a convenient way for him to stay informed and connected with his community, and he believes that it has made a significant positive impact on his life. Benjamin, on the other hand, holds a contrasting view, as he prefers to distance himself from social media. He believes that the digital landscape that platforms like Facebook create can lead to unhealthy habits, such as addiction to likes, shares, and constant monitoring of notifications. He contends that these habits can be detrimental to mental well-being and foster a sense of superficiality and inauthenticity in both users and their relationships. Moreover, Benjamin is concerned with the growing number of privacy and data security issues surrounding social media platforms. He often cites high-profile scandals such as the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which the personal information of millions of Facebook users was harvested without their consent and used for political purposes. This has led Benjamin to be cautious about sharing his personal information online, as he values his privacy and the integrity of his data. Additionally, Benjamin is also troubled by the role social media plays in the dissemination of fake news, misinformation, and the polarizing effect it has on public discourse. He frequently debates with Dennis over the potential consequences of relying on social media as a primary information source, arguing that it can lead to the formation of echo chambers and contribute to the rise of extremist views. Benjamin prefers to consume news from reputable outlets and engage in face-to-face conversations with people holding diverse opinions to foster a more balanced understanding of current affairs. Dennis acknowledges Benjamin's concerns but also appreciates the value that Facebook and other social media platforms provide when used responsibly. The two friends often find themselves in thought-provoking discussions on the topic, with Dennis advocating for the meaningful connections and opportunities for personal and professional growth that can result from using social media, while Benjamin emphasizes the importance of being cautious and mindful when navigating the digital landscape. As both friends present compelling arguments, their conversations provide an insight into the broader debate on the role of social media in modern society. The contrasting perspectives of Dennis and Benjamin serve to remind us that the digital age is multifaceted, and a nuanced approach to social media engagement may be the key to realizing its benefits while mitigating its drawbacks. By constantly evaluating and reassessing our online habits, we can hope to strike the right balance and maintain healthy relationships with both the digital world and our real-life connections."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that neither agree with nor contradict each other.

Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - Grosse Pointe Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan .

Sholem was from a faraway land called Poland, but he wrote his play in a language called Yiddish. Yiddish is usually spoken by Jewish people from many different countries. Now, some people are going to put on this play again, but they will do it in the same Yiddish language that it was first written in. That's very exciting! Imagine if we had a story written in a language like pirate talk, and we got to hear it just the way it was first told. That makes the story even more fun and special, right? That's how people feel about hearing \\"God of Vengeance\\" in Yiddish. The play \\"God of Vengeance\\" is about a family who lives in a house that has some secret rooms. The dad in the family wants to be a good person, but he has a hard time because he's been doing bad things.

A raincoat is preferred over an umbrella because it provides better protection and is less likely to break, which is essential in outdoor activities like hiking.

Movie plot title: Devdas Movie plot: The son of Zamindar Narayan Mukherjee, Devdas was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He grew up in the lush village of Taj Sonapur, where he spent his childhood, indulged by his lovely playmate Paro. They grew up sharing a special relationship, in which they existed only to each other. Oblivious of all the differences of status and background, a bond that would never break grew between them. Slowly, it changed to love but it was still unsaid. But the reverie was broken when his family sent Devdas to Calcutta for education. Paro's world crashed knowing that her Devdas would be gone and she lit a diya, for it signified the fast coming back of her loved one. Years passed and Devdas returned. Devdas was besotted by her stunning beauty and longed to have her back. But Zamindar Narayan Mukherjee, Devdas' father, met Paro's mother Sumitra's marriage proposal with condescending arrogance. It caused a rift between the families and even though Devdas tried to convince his father, only antagonism came his way. Finally, he moved away from Paro and wrote a letter to her, asking her to forget him. Only, he didn't realize that he would never be able to forget her ever. And much later, when he reached out to her, it was too late as she was far too humiliated. She scorned him for not standing by her and they parted forever with a heart-broken Paro entering into a chaste marriage with a wealthy, much older man, Zamindar Bhuvan, while a shattered Devdas walked towards anguish, alcoholism &amp; Chandramukhi. Chandramukhi, a stunning courtesan instantly lost her heart to Devdas. A unique bond was formed between both as he could share with her the intense pain of his unfulfilled love for Paro. Meanwhile, Paro, on the other hand, performed her worldly duties sincerely, but inside her heart, she could never forget Devdas for a moment. Strange was the fate of Devdas. Intensely loved by two women, who were never meant to be his. One whom he could never love and one whom he could never stop loving The answer is:","response":"When Devdas returns from law school, his friendship with Paro undergoes significant changes due to the circumstances surrounding their families and their unspoken love. The relationship between their families becomes strained when Devdas' father, Zamindar Narayan Mukherjee, condescendingly rejects Paro's mother's marriage proposal for their children. This event leads to a rift between the families, and despite Devdas' attempts to convince his father otherwise, he is met with only antagonism. In an attempt to move on, Devdas writes a letter to Paro asking her to forget him. However, he underestimates the depth of his own feelings for her. When he eventually reaches out to Paro again, it is too late, as she is humiliated and upset by his lack of support. Paro scornfully rebukes him for not standing by her, and the two part ways forever, with Paro entering into a chaste marriage with a wealthy, older man named Zamindar Bhuvan. As a result of these events, Devdas' friendship with Paro evolves into a more complex and turbulent relationship, fraught with longing and heartbreak. Devdas spirals into anguish and alcoholism, while Paro performs her marital duties faithfully but never forgets her love for Devdas. Throughout this difficult period, Devdas finds solace in his friendship with Chandramukhi, a beautiful courtesan who falls in love with him and provides a sympathetic ear for his unfulfilled love for Paro. Thus, Devdas' friendship with Paro is irrevocably altered, and he finds himself caught between two women who love him deeply but can never truly be his."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

A:","response":"Step 1: Analyze the key components of the review. - The band (The Number Twelve Looks Like You) is described as incredible, intense, and energetic, which are positive attributes. - The audio CD quality is described as very poor, which is a negative attribute. - The live DVD shows the band as crazy on stage and mellow off stage, which seems neutral or positive depending on interpretation. - The overall experience is described as a real let down, which is a negative attribute. Step 2: Determine the weight of each component. - Positive attributes (incredible, intense, energetic) seem to focus on the band itself. - Negative attributes (poor CD quality, let down) focus on experience of the product. - Neutral or positive attribute (crazy on stage, mellow off stage) gives some insight into the band's personality. Step 3: Evaluate the overall sentiment of the review based on the weight of each component.

Whether law dictates that you return, retain, or recover the ring from your ex, you should obey the ruling immediately in order to avoid further fines or sanctions. If you need to return the ring, take it to your lawyer’s office so that they can hand it over in a timely and professional manner. If you need to get the ring back from your ex, have your lawyer or a mutual friend make the hand-off in order to avoid emotional, messy scenes. No matter how the issue was decided, you should allow yourself time to reflect on the lost relationship which the engagement ring symbolized. Many psychologists argue that this process resembles the grieving process one endures after a death, so don’t underestimate the emotional toll this stage can take. If you find yourself so depressed that you don’t leave the house, have trouble sustaining normal eating patterns, or fixating on your ex in unhealthy ways, seek professional help from a therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist. You might feel like crawling into a corner and licking your wounds in the aftermath of your painful breakup, but try to resist this impulse to isolation. Studies have shown that meaningful social support such as close friends and family can mitigate a number of the adverse effects of stress—for example, lowering the hike in blood pressure and buffering damage to the cardiovascular and nervous system—as well as accelerate the healing process. Make a special effort to spend time doing things you love with the people you love. A simple afternoon movie with friends or potluck dinner can provide immeasurable emotional comfort while distracting you from the pain of your breakup. Try not to bottle up your emotions. No matter how difficult it may be, try to find a way to process your emotions. For some people, this may involve talking to family and friends, but if this is difficult for you, you may want to find a creative outlet, such as journaling or drawing. Giving yourself time to feel sad and damaged from the broken engagement will eventually help you to find closure in the future. Experts describe this process as one where you soak in the feelings of loneliness and pain in order to let go of them later. Once you're ready, you can forgive your ex-fiancee and yourself for the breakup, which will also contribute to a sense of closure. Some experts even suggest a kind of ceremony when you feel ready to let the engagement go. You can invite a bunch of friends and have a raucous ex-engagement party, or you can organize a smaller, contemplative ritual kind of like a funeral for your relationship. If you’ve ended up as the rightful owner of the ring, you need to decide what you want to do with this token of your past relationship. In order to make this decision, though, you need to figure out how you feel about the ring and what it symbolizes to you. Ask yourself what emotions you experience when you look at the ring and what you would lose if you relinquished it. For example, if you remain friends with your ex and remain strongly attached to the ring, you might want to keep the ring as a keepsake or alter it into another piece of jewelry. If you still like the ring but associate it with painful and even traumatic memories, you should probably get rid of it.","response":"This article discusses the legal and emotional aspects of handling an engagement ring after a breakup, suggesting to follow the law, seek professional help if needed, maintain social support, process emotions, find closure, and decide the fate of the ring based on personal feelings."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to count the number of vowels (letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') / consonants (all letters other than vowels) in the given sentence.

The group was formed in 1995 and initially consisted of members will.i.am (William James Adams Jr.), apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo), and Taboo (Jaime Luis Gomez). The trio gained popularity in hip-hop circles and released their debut album, “Behind the Front,” in 1998. The album received critical acclaim and helped establish The Black Eyed Peas as a creative force within the music industry. Fergie (Stacy Ann Ferguson) joined the group in 2002, adding a distinctive female vocal presence and later becoming an essential component of the band's mainstream success. Fergie, who had initially gained fame as a member of the all-female pop group Wild Orchid, brought a different musical style and vibe to The Black Eyed Peas. This new sound was showcased in their third album, “Elephunk,” which was released in 2003. The album featured the hit singles \\"Where is the Love?\\" (featuring Justin Timberlake), \\"Hey Mama,\\" and \\"Let's Get It Started,\\" propelling the band to international stardom. The Black Eyed Peas continued their successful run with albums such as “Monkey Business” (2005), which included popular tracks like \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart,\\" \\"My Humps,\\" and \\"Pump It.\\" Their fifth album, “The E.N.D.” (2009), featured the record-breaking single \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" and the dance sensation \\"I Gotta Feeling.\\" This album showcased the band's evolution towards electronic dance music, solidifying their influence on global pop culture. In 2011, the group released their sixth album, “The Beginning,” which included the hit tracks \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\" and \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" Despite the continued commercial success, Fergie decided to take a hiatus from the group in 2017 to focus on her solo career, family life, and other interests. This led to The Black Eyed Peas briefly returning to their roots as a trio. However, in 2020, they released a new album called \\"Translation,\\" which included collaborations with artists such as Shakira, Maluma, and J Balvin. Throughout their career, The Black Eyed Peas have not only exhibited a unique capacity to experiment with different sounds and genres but also to address social issues and promote a message of unity.

The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind corn, which is where the term \\"windmill\\" comes from. We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \\"wind farm\\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \\"wind farms\\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air. The blades can be angled to cope with varying wind speeds. Some designs use vertical turbines , which don't need to be turned to face the wind. The towers are tall, to get the propellors as high as possible, up to where the wind is stronger. This means that the land beneath can still be used for farming. Question: What can be a suitable title for the passage? Options: A: Where to build a wind farm. B: ABC of the using of wind energy. C: How to make best use of wind. D: Wind energy is the best energy. The answer is:","response":"B: ABC of the using of wind energy."},{"question":"Question 1: What are the top paying jobs for a mechanical engineer?

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Stream of thoughts:","response":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to compare the premise and the hypothesis to see if there is a logical connection between the two statements. 1. Premise: A group of people looking in different directions trying to avoid the camera. This statement gives us the information that there are people who do not want to be captured in a photo, and they are actively trying to avoid being in the picture. 2. Hypothesis: People smiling at the camera happily. This statement describes a different scenario in which people are not only willingly facing the camera but are also happy and smiling. As these two statements describe different behavior in people's interactions with the camera, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The two statements appear contradictory. Therefore, the answer is: - no"},{"question":"I heard that Jan realized that she was running low on sugar, flour and eggs. And I was wondering How would Jan feel afterwards? Pick from: * unprepared to bake cookies; * disorganized; * prepared to bake the cake; The answer is:","response":"Jan would likely feel unprepared to bake cookies, disorganized and potentially even frustrated due to running low on essential baking ingredients like sugar, flour, and eggs. Jan's realization that her supplies are running low could lead her to feel unprepared to bake cookies since those ingredients are typically required in a cookie recipe. Sugar and flour are base ingredients used to create the dough's structure, while eggs act as a binding agent and help create the desired texture. Not having enough of these ingredients on hand would make it challenging to bake cookies, leaving Jan feeling unprepared and ill-equipped to complete her baking task. Additionally, Jan might feel disorganized due to her insufficient inventory of essential baking items. Having an organized pantry and keeping track of staple ingredients is crucial for successfully completing recipes without any hiccups. When essential ingredients such as sugar, flour, and eggs are missing, it can disrupt the baking process and potentially cause a sense of disorganization. This feeling could further lead to frustration or disappointment, as plans to bake cookies may have been thwarted by insufficient planning or mismanagement of available resources. Although Jan has not mentioned any intent to bake a cake, the fact that she is low on these crucial ingredients would leave her feeling unprepared for that task as well. However, the focus at this moment would be on the lack of ingredients to bake cookies, and that is what would contribute to Jan's feelings of being unprepared and disorganized."},{"question":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: This genus is named for the Juan Fernández Islands.

Options: - refrigerator - mouse trap - fridge - outside - plate Let's think step by step:","response":"Cheese can be potentially dangerous for some creatures in certain situations. Considering the options provided: 1. Refrigerator/Fridge: Cheese stored in a refrigerator or fridge is not likely to be dangerous for most creatures. However, smaller animals like insects or rodents that accidentally find themselves inside might face risks like extreme cold or being trapped. 2. Mouse trap: Cheese is often used as bait on mousetraps, which are designed to capture or kill mice and other small rodents. In this scenario, cheese could definitely be dangerous for some creatures, particularly those it is intended to capture. 3. Outside: Cheese left outside could attract various animals, such as rodents, insects, or even larger animals. If the cheese is contaminated or spoiled, it may cause harm to the creature consuming it. Additionally, cheese left outside may inadvertently draw predators, creating a dangerous situation for those creatures. 4. Plate: Cheese on a plate is not inherently dangerous to creatures. However, if an animal gets too close to humans eating at a table and tries to reach for the cheese on a plate, it could be in danger—either from humans attempting to shoo it away or other potential harm, e.g., a pet cat or dog getting aggressive. Out of these options, a mouse trap is the most likely scenario where cheese can be dangerous for some creatures, as it is intentionally designed to capture or kill certain animals attracted to the bait."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the spatial device Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career? from the following article ? As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to...

In the premise, we learn that a young woman, dressed in a white shirt and wearing glasses, is engaged in a conversation with a group of people. This statement highlights that the woman is not alone, as she is interacting with others. It also gives us some sense of the woman's appearance and her current activity. However, it does not provide any information about the setting or location of this interaction, such as whether they are indoors, outdoors, or on a boat. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that \\"a woman is alone on a boat.\\" Here, the most crucial piece of information, apart from the woman's presence on a boat, is the fact that she is described as being \\"alone.\\" This statement focuses more on the location – that being the boat – and the solitude of the woman. There is no indication of the woman's physical appearance or any other contextual detail. Given the information provided in each statement separately, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is valid or invalid, as the premise alone does not provide sufficient evidence to paint a complete picture of the situation or the woman's location. A more explicit description of the surroundings or the specific events taking place might be necessary to confirm or refute the hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot directly conclude whether the hypothesis is true or false based upon the information given in the current premise."},{"question":"Translate the following sentence to French: • Access to Safe and Effective Health Products and Food and Information for Healthy Choices","response":"Accès à des Produits de Santé et Aliments Sûrs et Efficaces et Informations pour des Choix Sains Here's how we can explain it to a five-year-old: Imagine you have a magic door that leads you to all the good stuff for your body - like medicine when you're sick, or healthy food like apples and broccoli.

John Buchan (1875-1940) was a Scottish novelist, historian, and politician who is best known for his thriller novels, particularly \\"The Thirty-Nine Steps.\\" He was, however, an accomplished author, writing more than 100 books across various genres, including historical fiction, biographies, and war commentaries. In addition to his literary career, Buchan also held various political and administrative positions throughout his life. In 1935, he was appointed the 15th Governor General of Canada by King George V and held the position until his death in 1940. Upon his appointment, he was granted the title of 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, a title which became a hereditary peerage in the British nobility. As Baron Tweedsmuir, Buchan played a significant role in promoting Canadian culture and unity during his tenure as Governor General, supporting the development of the arts and literature in Canada. He also fostered a greater connection between the provinces and territories, using his diplomatic skills to strengthen the Canadian Confederation.

Under the leadership of head coach Doug Marrone, the Jaguars finished the regular season with a 10-6 record, winning the AFC South division and securing their first playoff berth since 2007. The Jaguars performed impressively in the playoffs, starting with a Wild Card round victory against the Buffalo Bills. In a hard-fought, defensive matchup, the Jaguars emerged as the winners with a 10-3 scoreline, advancing to the Divisional Round. In the Divisional Round, the Jaguars faced the heavily favored Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite being considered underdogs, the Jaguars shocked the Steelers and the league with a thrilling 45-42 victory, exhibiting a strong offensive and defensive performance. Quarterback Blake Bortles threw for 214 yards, completing 14 of 26 passes, while rookie running back Leonard Fournette amassed 109 rushing yards and scored three touchdowns. The impressive Divisional Round win propelled the Jaguars to the AFC Championship Game, where they took on the New England Patriots, a perennial powerhouse led by quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick. Despite leading for most of the game, the Jaguars ultimately succumbed to a late Patriots comeback, losing 24-20. This marked the end of their playoff run, falling just one game short of reaching Super Bowl LII. The 2017-2018 playoffs marked a significant turnaround and resurgence for the Jacksonville Jaguars franchise, showcasing their potential and earning them league-wide respect.

From a negative perspective, the phrase clearly implies that Uncle Ralph is an evil character. Describing someone as \\"evil\\" indicates the presence of morally bad intentions or behaviors from this character, evoking negative feelings or thoughts toward the character. Also, the use of the term \\"complexly\\" implies that this evil nature is not straightforward, indicating possible deception or cunning nature that would create more negativity towards the character. Furthermore, the phrase \\"I've ever seen in the many film\\" highlights that this example of evilness is so significant that it is memorable and noteworthy, only further emphasizing its negative qualities. However, from a positive perspective, the phrase implies that the portrayal and characterization of Uncle Ralph is quite remarkable, as it has such an impact on the person who has seen the film. The terms \\"subtlest\\" and \\"complexly\\" suggest a level of sophistication or depth to the portrayal of this character, and can be interpreted as a positive attribute, as it shows the skill of the actor or the filmmaker. The phrase \\"I've ever seen in the many film\\" also can be interpreted as a compliment, given that out of the numerous movies the speaker has seen, this particular portrayal stands out. Overall, while the content being discussed is negative (i.e., the evil nature of Uncle Ralph), there is a positive aspect to the statement, as it highlights the effectiveness of the character's portrayal in the film. Therefore, the phrase can be seen to have both positive and negative dimensions, depending on the perspective taken."},{"question":"Q:Question: what team in the federal league is a perennial loser for years?

Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. and the situation: Tony and Greg are brothers. They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away. Answer the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Tony will experience more tooth decay compared to Greg. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion. Firstly, Tony is consuming a snack consisting of candy, which is typically high in sugar content. The bacteria in the mouth feed on these sugars and produce lactic acid as a waste product. This lactic acid can dissolve tooth enamel, eventually leading to cavities and tooth decay. In contrast, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which is a much healthier snack option in terms of dental health. Celery is not only low in sugar but also can help clean teeth due to its fibrous texture. The act of chewing celery stimulates saliva production, which helps to neutralize acids in the mouth and wash away food particles stuck between teeth. This makes it less likely that Greg will develop tooth decay, at least in comparison to Tony. As for the milk products in the living room, it's worth noting that the lactic acid produced in fermentation contributes to the thickening of the milk, as mentioned in the background information. However, even if Greg consumes the thickened milk, it may not necessarily increase his risk of tooth decay significantly, especially when compared to Tony's candy consumption. Milk contains calcium, which is beneficial for teeth and can help to neutralize some of the acids in the mouth. So, while the thickened milk might not be as fresh, it should not significantly impact Greg's dental health. In conclusion, Tony is more likely to experience tooth decay due to his consumption of high-sugar candy, which promotes lactic acid production and tooth enamel erosion. On the other hand, Greg's choice of a healthier snack, celery, and the possibility of consuming milk products should not contribute as significantly to tooth decay. Therefore, Tony will likely experience more tooth decay than Greg."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: An alien spaceship comes to Earth while searching for a planet suitable to raise \\"Gargons\\", a lobster-like but air-breathing creature that is a delicacy on their home world. Thor (Bryan Grant) shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures by vaporizing a dog named Sparky. Crew member Derek (David Love), after discovering an inscription on Sparky's dog tag, fears that the Gargon might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \\"supreme race\\", they disdain \\"foreign beings\\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \\"families\\" and \\"friendships\\" are forbidden on their world. Derek turns out to be a member of an alien underground that commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history. Their one Gargon seems to be sick in Earth's atmosphere. While his crew mates are distracted, Derek leaves. Eventually, the Gargon seems to revive. When the Captain reports his actions, Derek is quickly connected to their Leader (Gene Sterling); Derek, it turns out, is the Leader's son, although Derek is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to kill him in order to protect their mission to Earth. They return to their base, leaving the Gargon behind. Meanwhile, Derek finds the home address he found on the dog's tag. There he meets Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her Grandpa Joe (Harvey B. Dunn). They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty's boyfriend, reporter Joe Rogers (Tom Graeff), can't make their afternoon date, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spaceship landed and shows her Sparky's remains. She doesn't believe him, so he describes Thor's weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crew mate.

Eating unprocessed beef, pork or lamb appeared not to raise risks of heart attacks and diabetes, they said, suggesting that salt and chemical preservatives may be the real cause of these two health problems associated with eating meat. The study, an analysis of other research called a meta-analysis, did not look at high blood pressure or cancer, which are also linked with high meat consumption. \\"To lower risk of heart attacks and diabetes, people should consider which types of meats they are eating,\\" said Renata Micha of the Harvard School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Circulation. \\"Processed meats such as bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs and processed deli meats may be the most important to avoid,\\" Micha said in a statement. Based on her findings, she said people who eat one serving per week or less of processed meats have less of a risk. The American Meat Institute objected to the findings, saying it was only one study and that it stands in contrast to other studies and the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans. \\"At best, this hypothesis merits further study. It is certainly no reason for dietary changes,\\" James Hodges, president of the American Meat Institute, said in a statement. Most dietary guidelines recommend eating less meat. Individual studies looking at relationships between eating meat and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes have had mixed results. But studies rarely look for differences in risk between processed and unprocessed red meats, Micha said. She and colleagues did a systematic review of nearly 1,600 studies from around the world looking for evidence of a link between eating processed and unprocessed red meat and the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They defined processed meat as any meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or with the addition of chemical preservatives. Meats in this category included bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs or processed deli or luncheon meats. Unprocessed red meat included beef, lamb or pork but not poultry. They found that on average, each 1.8 oz (50 grams) daily serving of processed meat a day -- one to two slices of deli meats or one hot dog -- was associated with a 42 percent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes. They found no higher heart or diabetes risk in people who ate only unprocessed red meats. ||||| Pooling the study results, the researchers found that eating unprocessed red meat was not associated with heart disease or diabetes. But people who ate at least one serving a day of processed red meat -- one hot dog or two deli slices -- had a 42 percent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 percent higher risk of diabetes than people who did not eat processed red meat. Renata Micha of the Harvard School of Public Health and her colleagues systematically reviewed more than 1,500 studies about the relationship between red meat, processed meat, and total meat consumption and heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. They selected 20 studies involving more than 1.2 million participants from 10 countries who were followed for up to 18 years. More than 23,000 people developed heart disease, more than 2,200 had strokes, and more than 10,000 had diabetes. Red meat has long been cast as a bad player in heart disease and diabetes. But a new analysis from Harvard suggests that processed red meat -- think bacon, salami, and hot dogs -- may be the true dietary villain. Total consumption of processed and unprocessed meat fell in between, with a 12 percent increased risk of diabetes compared to non-meat eaters. Results for heart disease were not conclusive. Neither kind of meat was tied to stroke, but because only 3 of the 20 studies looked at stroke, the sample was too small to draw statistically valid conclusions, the authors said. Recommendations to cut down on red meat usually focus on the fat and cholesterol they contain, which can clog coronary arteries. But both processed and unprocessed meat contain similar amounts, the researchers found. People who ate the two kinds of meats were alike when it came to smoking, exercise, and other lifestyle factors. The researchers say the salt and preservatives found in processed meat may account for the difference. Some processed meat has four times the salt that unprocessed meat has, and salt is a known contributor to high blood pressure, which can cause heart disease. Processed meat preservatives such as nitrates have been linked to lowered glucose tolerance, which is a factor in diabetes. The American Meat Institute Foundation took issue with the study. \\"At best, this hypothesis merits further study. It is certainly no reason for dietary changes,\\" James H. Hodges, the trade group's president, said in an e-mailed statement. \\"The body of evidence clearly demonstrates that processed meat is a healthy part of a balanced diet. Meat contains protein, amino acids and essential nutrients like iron and zinc that are the keys to good health.\\" The Harvard analysis, published online today in the journal Circulation, doesn't prove cause and effect between processed meat and these diseases, but it does make a compelling argument for studying processed and unprocessed meat separately. And unprocessed meat isn't off the hook, having been linked in other research to higher rates of colon cancer. \\"People should not use this finding as an excuse to eat all the unprocessed meat you like,\\" Micha, a research fellow in epidemiology, said in an interview. \\"We know fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish are associated with lower risk. People should put more emphasis on increasing foods in their diet that are shown to be protective.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Eating processed meats such as bacon, sausage, hot dogs, and deli meats can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes, according to a study by U.S. researchers.

The study analyzed 1,600 studies and found that each 50-gram daily serving of processed meat was associated with a 42% higher risk of heart disease and a 19% higher risk of developing diabetes.

Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, June or December? Answer:","response":"December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to June. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case. The Earth revolves around the Sun and experiences variations in climate throughout the year due to its tilt and rotation. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. This tilt and the way the Earth rotates around the Sun are responsible for the change in seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere, June marks the beginning of the summer season, whereas December is the beginning of the winter season. During June, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, which results in warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours. This time of the year experiences the Summer Solstice, typically around June 21st, when the Northern Hemisphere experiences the longest day of the year in terms of daylight hours. On the contrary, in December, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. This leads to colder temperatures and shorter daylight hours as less solar energy reaches the Northern Hemisphere. Around December 21st, the region experiences the Winter Solstice, which is the day with the shortest period of daylight. It is essential to note that the seasons are opposite between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. That is why Stan, who moved from the US (Northern Hemisphere) to Australia (Southern Hemisphere), still gets confused about the seasons in the southern hemisphere, despite using the same calendar as the rest of the world. In summary, December is the colder month in the Northern Hemisphere compared to June. This difference in temperature is due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and the Earth's rotation around the Sun, which result in distinct seasonal variations and more or less solar energy reaching different hemispheres during various times of the year."},{"question":"Choose from: +negative; +positive; What would be an example of an positive review?","response":"+positive An example of a positive review would be one where the reviewer expresses satisfaction, enjoyment, or favorable opinions about a product, service, or experience.

A major is the most prestigious and challenging tournament in golf, and winning a major cements a golfer's legacy. Further, in that particular year, she managed to cross the 2 million mark in earnings for the fourth consecutive season. This is a noteworthy feat as it demonstrates her consistency in performing at a high level and dominating the sport. The benchmark also serves as a testament to her dedication and commitment towards the game. It is clear that Annika Sorenstam has had an impressive year, where she has proven her unparalleled skill and prowess on the golf course. Yet, she is not at the ADT Championship to sit back and relax. The ADT Championship is a limited-field tournament that takes place at the end of the season. It is a prestigious event that showcases the best of the best in the world of women's golf. It is suggested that despite having nothing left to prove, Sorenstam's competitive nature and love for the game remain intact, and she is likely to approach this championship with the same determination and zeal as any other tournament. In conclusion, the passage illustrates the remarkable year Annika Sorenstam has had in her golf career, with incredible achievements such as seven victories, winning another major championship, and crossing the 2 million mark in earnings for four years in a row. Though she has accomplished and exhibited her skill set beyond doubt, it is implied that she remains steadfastly driven, as she enters the ADT Championship with her competitive spirit."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -99*v + 45*v + 47*v = 0 for v.","response":"To solve the equation -99*v + 45*v + 47*v = 0 for v, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the variables. We have v as a common factor in each term, so we'll combine the coefficients of v: -99 + 45 + 47 Step 2: Evaluate the expression. Evaluating the expression, we get: -99 + 45 + 47 = -54 + 47 = -7 So now, our equation looks like this: -7*v = 0 Step 3: Solve for v. To solve for v, we'll isolate the variable by dividing both sides by -7: v = 0 / -7 Step 4: Simplify the equation. Simplifying the equation, we get: v = 0 So, the solution to the equation -99*v + 45*v + 47*v = 0 is v = 0."},{"question":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","response":"Una de las maravillas naturales más impresionantes de América Latina es la extensa selva tropical del Amazonas, conocida por su rica biodiversidad y su importancia fundamental en el equilibrio ecológico global, donde la preservación de su flora y fauna se ha convertido en una prioridad para los gobiernos, organizaciones ambientales y la comunidad internacional."},{"question":"Answer the following question.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"First, we need to examine both statements closely to see if there are any similarities or differences between them. Statement 1: \\"A blond woman looks at her phone while standing next to a man.\\" In this statement, we have information about: - The woman's hair color (blond) - Her action (looking at her phone) - Her position (standing) - The presence of a man (next to her) Statement 2: \\"A woman is sitting alone on a bench texting on her phone.\\" In this statement, we have information about: - The woman's action (texting on her phone) - Her position (sitting) - Her location (on a bench) - The presence or absence of other people (alone) Now, let's compare these two statements to see if there is any evidence that they might be referring to the same situation: - The hair color of the woman is not mentioned in statement 2, so we cannot compare this aspect. - Both women are using their phones, but while the woman in statement 1 is looking at her phone, the woman in statement 2 is texting on her phone. This is a slight difference, but they could still be describing the same situation. - The woman in statement 1 is standing, while the woman in statement 2 is sitting. This is a clear difference in their positions. - In statement 1, the woman is with a man, while in statement 2, the woman is alone. This is a clear difference in the presence or absence of other people. Based on this analysis, it appears that there are several significant differences between the two statements, including the position of the woman and the presence of other people. Therefore, it can be concluded that these two statements are not describing the same situation. So, the correct answer is: - No"},{"question":"Given the question: What's the name of the person Amah helps take care of? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1906 San Francisco, Frisco Jenny Sandoval, a denizen of the notorious Tenderloin district, wants to marry piano player Dan McAllister, but her saloonkeeper father Jim is adamantly opposed to it. An earthquake kills both men and devastates the city. In the aftermath, Jenny gives birth to a son, whom she names Dan. With financial help from crooked lawyer Steve Dutton, who himself came from the Tenderloin, she sets herself up in the vice trade, providing women on demand. Jenny has one loyal friend, the Chinese woman Amah, who helps take care of the baby. At a party in Steve's honor, he catches gambler Ed Harris (an uncredited J. Carrol Naish) cheating him in a back room. In the ensuing struggle, Steve kills him, with Jenny the only eyewitness. The pair are unable to dispose of the body before it is found and are questioned by the police. However, neither is charged. The scandal forces Jenny to temporarily give up her baby to a very respectable couple who owe Steve a favor to keep the child from being taken away from her. After three years, she tries to take her son back, but the boy clings to the only mother he can remember, so she leaves him where he is. He grows up and goes to Stanford University, where he becomes a football star, graduates with honors, and becomes first a lawyer, then an assistant district attorney. Jenny lovingly follows his progress. Meanwhile, she takes over the vice and bootlegging in the city.

Answer:","response":"The product review conveys a mixed sentiment, leaning more towards positive. The reviewer has not heard the specific title \\"fun girls screaming opinions to those who listen,\\" but they mention being familiar with other work by the same group and enjoying it. The comparison to other bands like Blatz and the mention of simply liking girl bands indicates that the reviewer appreciates the genre or style. The reviewer does not directly compare the group to Snap-Her, indicating that they may not quite fit the same style. Despite some uncertainty and not having heard this specific title, the reviewer still expresses a desire to buy the CD if they had the money, signifying a positive sentiment toward the music. Additionally, mentioning that there are three pre-teen girls playing punk music 10 years ago could be interpreted as impressive and adds a positive note. However, there are some slight negative undertones in the review as well. The reviewer seems unsure of their overall opinion and appears disoriented, questioning how they ended up on the site and why they're even writing the review. This suggests that their opinion may not be as enthusiastic or clear-cut as it could be, which raises questions about the strength of their positive sentiment.

But Nunez's game-winning RBI in his first career start was overshadowed by the news that Alex Rodriguez, the man Nunez was starting in place of at third Saturday, was going on the 15-day disabled list because of an injured left calf. After Rodriguez lasted all of one swing in his comeback attempt Friday night, the Yankees huddled over his condition Saturday and decided to \\"play it safe,\\" Joe Girardi said. \\"We don't feel he's any worse than the time before, but we're just going to play it extremely safe here and know that we have a player in 15 days,\\" Girardi said. \\"We just all felt, you know what, it's probably in our best interests to put him on the DL.\\" The Yankees probably made a mistake by not doing it sooner - A-Rod was originally injured Monday. If he had not tried to play Friday, they would've been able to back-date his stay on the DL and save four days. Rodriguez had already left the Stadium Saturday by the time reporters were allowed into the Yankee clubhouse after the game, but a team spokesman said A-Rod will address the media Sunday about his trip to the DL, his first since he missed the first 27 games of last season following hip surgery. Oddly, the Yankees are 11-0 this season when Rodriguez, who is second in the majors with 97 RBI, does not start. Also casting a pall over the Yankees' victory: Vazquez's third consecutive rough outing. He lasted only three-plus innings, matching his shortest start of the season, and gave up three homers, tying his career high. One of the home runs might not have landed yet except Russell Branyan's mammoth shot crashed into the 300 level in right, the first ball hit into the upper deck at the new Stadium. Vazquez allowed four runs on eight hits and, with the way he is pitching, two-fifths of the Yankee rotation is shaky. A.J. Burnett is inconsistent at best and Vazquez has allowed 12 earned runs in his last 111/3 innings. The Yankees are trying to fix the rotation, too, and hope that their decision to give every starter an extra day of rest over the next turn will help - prospect Ivan Nova will be called up to start Monday in Toronto, pushing everyone else back. Girardi also said he will examine whether to split up Burnett and Vazquez, who right now make a combustible back-to-back combo that will tax the strong Yankee bullpen, which has a 1.53 ERA since July 26, if they continue leaving games early. The 23-year-old Nunez likely will split time at third with Ramiro Pena while Rodriguez heals, Girardi said. Nunez started Saturday, in part because he seems to be a bigger offensive threat than Pena, and later was replaced by Pena for defensive purposes. Nunez snapped a 4-4 tie with a one-out, RBI single that zipped through the right side of the infield in the seventh. Derek Jeter followed with another RBI single and Mark Teixeira added a sac fly for a 7-4 advantage. Still, Girardi must have felt the lead was tenuous because he brought in Mariano Rivera for a rare four-out save. Rivera replaced David Robertson in the eighth with two out and the tying run at the plate, and got Michael Saunders to pop up. Rivera allowed one run in the ninth after the Yankees had tacked on two insurance runs, but closed the game for his first save of more than one inning this year. So now the Yankees stare at 15 days of a pennant race without Rodriguez and while they have coped without him, they are occasionally prone to vanishing offensively. Losing their cleanup hitter can't help that. \\"We all have to continue to play well and pick each other up,\\" Teixeira said. \\"It's what we've done all season. It's not the first injury we've had this year. We're obviously going to miss him. You can't help but miss a guy like Alex.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"The Yankees secured a 9-5 victory over the Mariners, aided by Eduardo Nunez's game-winning RBI single, despite a disappointing performance by Javier Vazquez and news of Alex Rodriguez being placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a calf injury.

The original premise states \\"In the resorts on the coast, many traders are aware that some tourists feel uncomfortable with bargaining, and will give you their best price straight away if you ask them to.\\" This statement implies the opposite of the conclusion presented. The premise suggests that there are traders at coastal resorts who understand the discomfort some tourists may feel when asked to haggle over prices. As a result, these traders are willing to provide their best price immediately upon request. It reflects an understanding of their customer's needs and a business approach that values customer comfort and satisfaction. Therefore, based on the original premise provided, it would be more accurate to conclude that \\"Some traders at coastal resorts are indeed willing to give their best offer immediately if asked.\\" This conclusion aligns with the information the premise provides and is supported by the understanding that these traders have adapted their selling strategies in response to some tourists' discomfort with bargaining. Additionally, while the premise states \\"many traders\\" will offer their best price if you ask them to, it doesn't imply that all do. It's possible that some traders may still default to bargaining as their primary method of setting a price for goods. So it might be necessary, depending on the specific trader, to clarify a tourist's willingness or lack thereof to negotiate prices.

Yep, if there's one thing that Disney is never short of, it's narcissism. But that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film. It's basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective. And it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'The Lion King' by heart to see where they're coming from. Anyway, at one level I was watching this and thinking \\"Oh my god this is so lame...\\" and on another level I was having a ball. Much of the humour is predictable - I mean, when Pumbaa makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for Timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that Timon is going to take the big one. But that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, IMO, is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. It's not what happens, it's how. And a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where Pumbaa takes centre stage? But as fart jokes go, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur. The returning voice talent is great. I'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky).

Make an “ng” sound in your nose as though you were just saying the final part of the word “sung.” Continue to make this noise as you do three to five pitch sweeps. Every time you go back up and down again, push your voice into a slightly higher and lower pitch range. This exercise helps you warm up the voice gradually, prevents over-exertion of the voice, and helps singers transition between their head and chest voices, which refers to the different places air resonates in the body when creating different sounds and pitches. Tongue twisters are great for articulation practice, and if you say them in different pitches and at different volumes, they can be a great way to warm up before singing.

The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her... A:","response":"Title Suggestion: \\"Wartime Whispers at Starlings\\" This title captures the essence of the movie by referencing the Miniver family's residence ('Starlings') and their encounters with different aspects of World War II, including Vin's personal journey as a fighter pilot and how it affects his relationship with Carol Beldon. The word 'Whispers' suggests the movie's focus on the emotional and interpersonal dynamics of the characters as they navigate their lives and relationships during the chaos and uncertainty of war, with love, patriotism, and sacrifice being the main driving forces behind their actions. Furthermore, the inclusion of 'Wartime' in the title sets the historical context, emphasizing not only the intrinsic tension that accompanies war but also the sense of unity that arises amidst the devastation, drawing the Miniver family and those around them closer together."},{"question":"Leo: Test for natural language inference.

The park was designated in 1954, and was extended in 2016. Over 20,000 residents live and work in the park, which attracts over eight million visitors every year. - The River Aire is a major river in Yorkshire, England, in length. In the \\"Handbook for Leeds and Airedale\\" (1890), it notes that the distance from Malham to Howden is direct, but the river's meanderings extend that to . Part of the river below Leeds is canalised, and is known as the Aire and Calder Navigation. - The Aire and Calder Navigation is a river and canal system of the River Aire and the River Calder in the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, England. The first improvements to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826. The New Junction Canal was constructed in 1905, to link the system to the River Don Navigation, by then part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation. - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. - West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. - Skipton ( also known as Skipton - in - Craven ) is a market town and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire , England .

The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - The Yorkshire Dales is an upland area of the Pennines in Northern England in the historic county of Yorkshire, most of it in the Yorkshire Dales National Park created in 1954. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - The Liverpool City Region is an economic and political area of England centred on Liverpool, which also incorporates the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, and Wirral. Other, wider, definitions of the city region also exist. Depending on the definition used, the region's population is between about 1.5 million and 2.3 million. - Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the appellation of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey. - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - The West Riding of Yorkshire is one of the three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire, England. From 1889 to 1974 the administrative county, County of York, West Riding (abbreviated: \\"County of York (W.R.)\\") (the area under the control of West Riding County Council), was based closely on the historic boundaries. The lieutenancy at that time included the City of York and as such was named West Riding of the County of York and the County of the City of York. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Elmet was an independent Brittonic kingdom covering a region of what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Early Middle Ages, between about the 5th century and early 7th century. Although its precise borders are unclear, it appears to have been bounded by the River Sheaf in the south and the River Wharfe in the east. It adjoined Deira to the north and Mercia to the south, and its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly a minor British kingdom. As such it was well to the east of other territories of the Britons in Wales and the West Country (\\"i.e.\\" Cornwall and Dumnonia), and to the south of those in the \\"Hen Ogledd\\" (\\"Old North\\"). As one of the southeasternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, it is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Municipal boroughs were a type of local government district which existed in England and Wales between 1835 and 1974, in Northern Ireland from 1840 to 1973 and in the Republic of Ireland from 1840 to 2002. Broadly similar structures existed in Scotland from 1833 to 1975 with the reform of royal burghs and creation of police burghs. - The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is a canal in Northern England, linking the cities of Leeds and Liverpool. Over a distance of , it crosses the Pennines, and includes 91 locks on the main line. It has several small branches, and in the early 21st century a new link was constructed into the Liverpool docks system. - Wakefield is a city in West Yorkshire, England, on the River Calder and the eastern edge of the Pennines, which had a population of 76,886 in 2001, increasing slightly for the five Wakefield wards (East, North, Rural, South and West) to 77,512 at the 2011 Census. - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London. - Craven is a local government district of North Yorkshire, England centred on the market town of Skipton. In 1974, Craven district was formed as the merger of Skipton urban district, Settle Rural District and most of Skipton Rural District, all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The population of the Local Authority at the 2011 Census was 55,409. It comprises the upper reaches of Airedale, Wharfedale, Ribblesdale, and includes most of the Aire Gap and Craven Basin. - Liverpool City Council is the governing body for the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. It consists of 90 councillors, three for each of the city's 30 wards. The council is currently controlled by the Labour Party and is led by Mayor Joe Anderson. It is a constituent council of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. - Malham is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. In the \\"Domesday Book\\", the name is given as Malgun, meaning \\"settlement by the gravelly places\\". In 2001 the parish had a population of approximately 150. Malham parish increased in size geographically (to include Malham Moor) and so at the 2011 Census had a population of 238. - An administrative county was an administrative division in England and Wales and Ireland from 1888 to 1974, used for the purposes of local government. They are now abolished, although in Northern Ireland their former areas are used as the basis for lieutenancy. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists. - Bradford is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, in the foothills of the Pennines west of Leeds, and northwest of Wakefield. Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough. - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Wharfedale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - Skipton was a rural district in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974. It was named after Skipton, which constituted an urban district on its southern border. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - Airedale is a geographic area in Yorkshire, England, corresponding to the river valley of the River Aire (pronounced \\"air\\"). - Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet grew but slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War. - The City of Bradford is a local government district of West Yorkshire, England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Bradford, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Keighley, Shipley, Bingley, Ilkley, Haworth, Silsden and Denholme. Bradford has a population of 528,155, making it the fourth-most populous metropolitan district and the sixth-most populous local authority district in England. It forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and the city is part of the Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), which, with a population of 2,393,300, is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom after London, Birmingham and Manchester. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Ribblesdale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the dale or upper valley of the River Ribble in North Yorkshire. Towns and villages in Ribblesdale (downstream, from north to south) include Selside, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Stainforth, Langcliffe, Giggleswick, Settle, Long Preston and Hellifield.

He had two older brothers, William and Isidor. He spent part of his youth in Mount Vernon, New York. Returning to the United States, Chayefsky worked in his uncle's print shop, Regal Press, an experience which provided a background for his later teleplay, Printer's Measure (1953), as well as his story for the movie As Young as You Feel (1951). Kanin enabled Chayefsky to spend time working on his second play, Put Them All Together (later known as M is for Mother), but it was never produced. Producers Mike Gordon and Jerry Bressler gave him a junior writer's contract. He wrote a story, The Great American Hoax, which sold to Good Housekeeping but was never published. He relocated to Hollywood, where he met his future wife Susan Sackler, and the couple married in February 1949. Failing to find work on the West Coast, Chayefsky returned to New York. During the late 1940s, he began working full-time on short stories and radio scripts, and during that period, he was a gagwriter for radio host Robert Q. Lewis. Chayefsky later recalled, \\"I sold some plays to men who had an uncanny ability not to raise money.\\" During 1951-52, Chayefsky wrote adaptations for radio's Theater Guild on the Air: The Meanest Man in the World (with James Stewart), Cavalcade of America, Tommy (with Van Heflin and Ruth Gordon) and Over 21 (with Wally Cox).

The man, identified as Syed Sharif Khan, was stripped naked, beaten and dragged through Dimapur, Nagaland state's main city, before being hanged. Hundreds of policemen have been patrolling the streets of Dimapur since the incident amid increasing tension. A curfew was also imposed in the city on Sunday to maintain law and order. In earlier reports, police named the dead man as Farid Khan, but his family told the BBC his name was Syed Sharif Khan. Police said Mr Khan was a Bengali-speaking Muslim trader from the neighbouring state of Assam. He was arrested in February on charges of raping a 19-year-old tribal woman three times. Mr Khan's brother said he was picked on because of ethnic reasons. According to reports, the woman was related to Mr Khan by marriage. After Mr Khan was taken from prison on Thursday, he was dragged through the streets by thousands of people. Police opened fire to try to stop the mob, wounding several people. On Monday, police said the arrested men had been charged with rioting, arson and unlawful assembly. \\"Some of these 42 arrested men were also directly involved in the lynching, and will face additional charges,\\" news agency AFP quoted Inspector General of Police Wabang Jamir as saying. There are conflicting versions of how a large mob entered the prison and then removed - and killed - one selected inmate. Image copyright AP Image caption A group of men entered the prison and took out the suspected rapist One version is that initially a small group of men went to the prison, and demanded to take out Mr Khan, and that some prison officials complied and led them to him. Only later, several thousand people collected outside the jail, demanding that the prisoner be handed over to them. The lynching happened in the midst of a controversy in India over the government's decision to ban India's Daughter, a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student in Delhi. But correspondents say the killing is also linked to rising ethnic tensions in Nagaland, whose indigenous tribespeople have blamed migrants from Assam state and Bangladesh for settling on their land. Vigilante justice is not unheard of in India but it is rarely seen on this scale. Analysis: Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The lynching points to rising anxiety among locals in Nagaland about Muslim Bangladeshi migrants who, they say, have illegally settled on their land and are encroaching on their resources. Many say it also proves how easily mass hysteria can be whipped up among local people to brand any Muslim migrant as Bangladeshi. The defendant in this case was not a Bangladeshi but a Bengali-speaker from the neighbouring state of Assam. His father served in the Indian air force, and two of his brothers are in the army. The incident points to a complete breakdown of law and order in Nagaland, which is wracked by a tribal insurgency. Chances of a settlement to the 58-year-old conflict continue to look dim after 17 years of negotiations because rebel factions who cannot agree on the territorial limits of a future Naga homeland or state. ||||| NEW DELHI — Photographs and videos on social media of an enraged mob that seized a man accused of rape from a jail in the northeastern Indian state of Nagaland, dragged him through the streets and beat him to death helped lead to the arrests of 22 people over the weekend, the authorities said. The police identified 200 to 300 people who had either been involved in the violence that erupted in the city of Dimapur on Thursday or helped incite it, according to Wabang Jamir, a police inspector general in Kohima, the capital of Nagaland. More arrests were likely in the coming days, Mr. Jamir said, adding that it was unclear whether some of those arrested belonged to organized groups. Another senior police official, Akheto Sema, said the thousands of people who descended on the jail were “a frenzied, leaderless, headless mob.” The charges against those arrested included unlawful assembly, rioting and arson. Shops were burned during the protests that sprang up on Wednesday and Thursday, after it was learned that a man said to be an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh had been arrested in the rape of a woman from a Naga tribe. As yet, none of those arrested have been charged in his death. ||||| GUWAHATI: The Nagaland government blocked all internet and mobile data services in the state for 48 hours from Saturday night to stop people from circulating images and videos of the lynching of Syed Sarif alias Farid Khan in Dimapur.It also imposed curfew in Dimapur town from 3pm on Sunday till 12 midnight following rumours that some people were planning a candlelight march at the town's City Tower in the evening where Khan was lynched.Khan, a businessman from Assam who was accused of allegedly raping his Naga wife's cousin, was dragged out of Dimapur jail, paraded naked, pelted with stones and lynched by a rampaging mob on Thursday.

Life in this little community is peaceful, and crime is practically non-existent. But as the full moon approaches, a series of mysterious attacks leaves a trail of victims. One of these victims is the sweet, unassuming Linda. Linda's best friend, Emily, finds her in a panic, covered in blood, and barely clinging to life. After calling for help, Emily seeks out the only person she can trust to help uncover the truth about what happened to her friend - Sheriff Barker. Without any evidence of the attacker and only Linda's chilling description of \\"a wild, beast-like creature\\" to go on, Sheriff Barker and Emily have their work cut out for them. The town is buzzing with fear and frustration as Sheriff Barker desperately tries to keep everyone calm and the community together. With each passing day, it becomes clear that there is something different about Linda. As the full moon looms, she begins experiencing strange blackouts, increased strength, and an unnerving hunger for raw meat. Her wounds heal quickly, which only further confuses the already perplexed Sheriff Barker. Sheriff Barker finds an old book in the town's library that suggests Willow's Creek may have a dark history. As he uncovers more clues, it becomes increasingly clear that this is not an isolated incident, and that these attacks have been happening for centuries - and are related to a hidden bloodline of werewolves. As Linda's condition rapidly deteriorates, Emily and Sheriff Barker must uncover the truth about Willow's Creek's history and expose the rising werewolf menace. The stakes are raised even higher when Linda's transformation becomes apparent to the town's residents, leaving Sheriff Barker in a desperate race against time to protect the life of his friend before she is condemned by the fearful townsfolk.

Does it follow that \\"The broken bell and Cynthia's absence contributed to the plan.\\"?","response":"Yes, it seems to follow that \\"The broken bell and Cynthia's absence contributed to the plan\\" in the given context. To provide a detailed and long answer, let us first understand each of these elements and analyze how they fit into the overall plan. 1. The Broken Bell: The broken bell refers to an event in which a bell, presumably located within a house or an establishment, was deliberately tampered with or damaged by Inglethorp, either personally or through his wife. The bell was seemingly an integral part of the daily routine or communication system within the premises. By rendering the bell useless or unreliable, it created a situation in which the characters involved in the story could not easily communicate or respond to one another's needs or actions in a timely manner. The broken bell hinders regular communication and may be an essential aspect of Inglethorp's plan because it could provide him an opportunity to execute actions covertly. For instance, he might engage in underhanded activities while others are preoccupied with figuring out a response to the unexpected challenge posed by the broken bell. The disruption caused by the broken bell meant that the characters present in the story would be more vulnerable to being manipulated or deceived, which may have been the intended goal for the plan. 2. Cynthia's Absence: Cynthia's absence alludes to a particular character, Cynthia, being kept away from the scene of the plan's execution. It is implied that Inglethorp orchestrated this through his wife, perhaps by convincing her to send Cynthia on an errand or to remove her from the area for a short period. This indicates that Cynthia's presence could pose a risk to the success of Inglethorp's plan. There could be several reasons why Cynthia's absence was essential for the plan. Cynthia might have potentially thwarted the plan if she were present, either due to her role within the narrative or her personal connections with other characters. Cynthia's absence might have allowed Inglethorp to manipulate the situation to his advantage, possibly by raising suspicion in Cynthia's direction or using her absence as a diversion to keep everyone's focus away from his objective. Alternately, Cynthia might possess specific knowledge or skills that would have unraveled Inglethorp's plan if she were present during its execution. In conclusion, the broken bell and Cynthia's absence both played essential roles in contributing to the plan orchestrated by Inglethorp. The broken bell served the purpose of disrupting effective communication and increasing the vulnerability of the characters involved, thus creating opportunities for deception and manipulation. Meanwhile, Cynthia's absence worked to remove a probable threat to the plan's success, either by diverting suspicion or preventing her from using her knowledge to expose Inglethorp's scheme. Through these orchestrated events, Inglethorp was able to create a set of circumstances that would enable his plan to unfold with a higher likelihood of success."},{"question":"What is the title of this article: During the English Civil War Plymouth sided with the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists.

However, accidents can happen at any time, sometimes leading to devastating consequences. A recent case that has gained attention is that of a young boy who was left paralysed after he was knocked off his moped. While the accident is undoubtedly tragic, the events that unfolded afterward, involving the police at the scene, has raised concerns about their handling of the situation. The Incident: A Fateful Turn of Events The story begins with the young boy riding his moped, a commonly used mode of transportation for short commuting distances. However, he finds himself in a terrible accident that ends with him sustaining life-altering injuries. The resulting paralysis is a nightmare for anyone, but what is truly alarming is the fact that the boy was held to the ground by police while being paralysed due to the incident. Police Conduct at the Scene: Allegations of Misconduct Following the accident, it appears that the attending police officers failed to assess the boy's condition accurately before restraining him. Witnesses have reported that the police held him to the ground, possibly exacerbating his injuries further. Questions loom over the necessity of using such force on a victim of a traumatic accident, especially considering the extent of his injuries. While police officers are required to maintain order at the scene of an accident and ensure public safety, it is crucial that they exercise caution and sensitivity when engaging with accident victims. The allegations of police misconduct raise multiple concerns, including the need for proper training in recognising and handling injured individuals during emergency situations. Impact on the Victim and His Family The repercussions of what transpired at the scene extend far beyond the physical damage suffered by the boy. The emotional and psychological trauma experienced not only by the victim but also his family is unfathomable. While grappling with the sudden and overwhelming impact of the accident, they must also come to terms with the alleged mistreatment by those in authority, who are expected to uphold their duty of care. Addressing the Problem: Importance of Proper Training and Accountability It is imperative that the authorities take these allegations seriously and carry out a thorough investigation into the matter. Establishing the facts and holding any accountable parties responsible is critical in preventing future missteps of a similar nature. Police training programs must incorporate adequate modules on dealing with accident victims, sensitive situations, and crises requiring a more compassionate approach. This could include emphasising the importance of first aid assessment, awareness of potential risks when engaging with injured individuals, and understanding the psychological impact of an accident on the victim and their families. Conclusion The case of the paralysed boy restrained by police highlights the unfortunate series of events that can occur not only during an accident but also in its aftermath. It serves as a reminder that all parties must come together in taking appropriate measures to prevent tragedies from spiralling into even more significant issues. In a world fraught with uncertainties, it's the response of communities and institutions to incidents like these that define the fabric of society. Ensuring that the appropriate steps are taken to prevent similar problems in the future will be crucial for the security and wellbeing of all citizens."},{"question":"Definition: In this task, you will be given a short story.

But Pieri was not only intoxicated while on call, authorities allege. They think he also was under the influence of alcohol when he participated in an emergency appendectomy at the Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center. He now faces charges of recklessly endangering another person, driving under the influence and public drunkenness, according to court documents. Security footage shows Pieri stumbling through the hospital parking lot late Feb. 4, on his way into surgery, according to the court documents. He walked with an “unsteady” gait and almost fell, the probable-cause affidavit states. His behavior, a Department of Veterans Affairs police detective wrote, was “consistent with someone who is under the influence of a controlled substance or alcoholic beverages.” Another nurse working that night told an investigator that Pieri was “definitely not himself,” according to the affidavit. He had trouble logging on to his computer, she said, and grew upset. “Rick, are you drunk or something?” the woman said she asked Pieri. A message left for Pieri was not returned. [Anesthesiologist trashes sedated patient — and it ends up costing her] A physician assistant also told an investigator that he smelled an alcohol in the operating room. He “concluded that the odor was likely emitted from one of the employees inside the room,” the documents state. Pieri told investigators that he visited Mohegan Sun casino at Pocono Downs on Feb. 4 and drank four or five beers while playing slots. He said he went home but was paged about the emergency surgery about 11:30 that night. “Pieri admitted that he knew he was not supposed to be a part of a surgery while he was intoxicated,” the affidavit says. But, the document states, he “claimed he had forgotten he was on call and did not want to have someone else come in.” According to the affidavit, Pieri “was responsible for preparing the patient, retrieving the patient, preparing the materials inside the room, documenting the surgery, and monitoring the vitals of the patient throughout recovery.” The operating room, the document notes, “is filled with complicated equipment that Pieri needs to operate and has several loose wires and cords that can be tripped on or disconnected by somebody with an inability to properly ambulate themselves.” [Cancer patients died waiting for care at troubled veterans’ hospital, probe finds] Medical staff at the hospital told investigators from the Department of Veterans Affairs Police Service that “taking part in a surgery with impaired cognitive ability can create a substantial risk to the safety of the patient.” The affidavit does not name the patient, but it notes that this person was later readmitted to the hospital with stomach pains. “To the best of my knowledge there’s been no harm as a result of the incident,” William Klaips, executive assistant to the VA Medical Center’s director, told The Washington Post. The affidavit, however, notes that “Pieri’s actions were knowingly reckless and could have caused serious injury or death to the patient.” On Thursday, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, sent letters to VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald and the medical center in Wilkes-Barre, requesting information on the incident. In a statement sent to The Post on Friday morning, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it “takes seriously any accusations that an employee’s actions might have placed a Veteran at risk.” Pieri, the VA statement said, “has been removed from patient care responsibilities at the Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center where this alleged incident took place. If necessary, additional actions will be proposed as the investigation is completed.” “Patient safety is paramount to all of us at VA and upon learning of the incident, we immediately confirmed patient care was not jeopardized,” the statement added. “We are currently reinforcing training to ensure all employees are empowered to raise operational concerns and to prevent a future incident from occurring.” This story, originally published on Feb. 25, has been updated.

Richard Pieri, 59, of Drums, is facing a charge of reckless endangerment under the Federal Assimilated Crimes Act, which allows state crimes to be charged in federal court if the crime occurs in federal jurisdiction, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The hospital is a federal facility. Prosecutors say the offense, which placed the patient “in danger of death or serious bodily injury,” carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a 5,000 fine. Pieri’s attorney, Shelley Centini, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Last month, the Luzerne County District Attorney’s Office dropped state charges of reckless endangerment, public drunkenness and driving under the influence, saying the U.S. Attorney’s Office intended to take over the prosecution. Prosecutors allege Pieri had been at Mohegan Sun Pocono the night of Feb. 4, when he was called back to the Veterans Affairs hospital in Plains Township to assist an emergency surgery. Pieri, who claimed he forgot he was on call that night, admitted to drinking about four or five beers at the casino. Surveillance footage showed him stumbling out of his pickup and nearly falling into a concrete barrier on his way into the hospital for the surgery, police said. Pieri resigned from his position at the hospital on March 2, just two days after medical center officials initiated disciplinary action against him. The state Board of Nursing suspended Pieri’s license that same week. 570-821-2058, @cvjimhalpin ||||| In October 1985, Richard J. Pieri was charged in the hit-and-run death of a veteran near the Wilkes-Barre VA Hospital. Now, 30 years later, he’s facing reckless endangerment charges after allegedly staggering into that same hospital and aiding in emergency surgery as an operating room nurse after drinking four or five beers at Mohegan Sun Pocono casino. The 59-year-old Drums resident faces DUI and public drunkenness charges as well. And while there was no mention of suspected alcohol use by Pieri in archived Times Leader stories about the hit-and-run death, Pieri’s estranged wife has pointed to his alleged alcohol use in a Protection From Abuse application she filed last year, claiming that he had been abusive to her after he had been drinking. To top it off, although police say Pieri admitted to being drunk while on call, it will take the VA Medical Center up to nine months to dole out disciplinary action such as termination from his job, the Times Leader learned Tuesday. It took police just nine days to investigate and charge Pieri in the death of 65-year-old George Knorr in 1985. The hit-and-run According to Times Leader archives, Knorr, of Scranton, died after he was struck by a vehicle the night of Sept. 25. The Luzerne County coroner determined the cause of death to be a broken neck, and the manner of death a homicide. A day after the accident, police seized a red pickup at the Wilkeswood Apartments in Wilkes-Barre Township and said they had a suspect in Knorr’s death. They said the suspect did not turn himself in, but was cooperating. Police were awaiting test results to see if there was a match between the paint on the pickup and paint found on Knorr’s body. Pieri was arrested on Oct. 3, 1985, and charged with an accident involving death or personal injury — a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a 2,500 fine and/or a year in jail. Township police considered lodging a charge of vehicular homicide or manslaughter, but they determined the death was not the result of gross negligence, an officer had told the Times Leader. The officer said Knorr, 65, of Scranton, was wearing dark clothing and was walking close to the roadway at about 10:50 p.m. in a dimly lit area when he was struck. The officer also said Pieri had not been driving recklessly. Pieri posted 5,000 bail and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. The charges were forwarded to Luzerne County Court, but the outcome of the case could not be determined Tuesday. A search for court records proved fruitless. The protection order The only court records that could readily be found for Pieri — other than a 2014 speeding ticket to which he pleaded guilty — was a Protection From Abuse order dated Oct. 26, 2015. Pieri’s wife, Judy, petitioned the court for the order, claiming that Pieri “apparently had been drinking” on the evening of Oct. 23 and, when she arrived home from a dinner with relatives, thought he was sleeping. Judy Pieri wrote in the application that she checked her husband’s cellphone and wallet “to try to check what he had been up to” because “he tells me nothing and I find myself snooping just to get information.” But, apparently, Pieri was awake and angry that she disturbed his wallet and cellphone, she wrote. Judy Pieri alleged that her husband pushed and shoved her down a hallway, that the two of them struggled and that her husband twice told her he would kill her. She wrote that Richard pushed her into a chair and that she kicked him away using both legs, causing him to drop to the ground and fracture one of his wrists. A judge ordered Pieri to turn over firearms that his wife had said were stored in a bedroom closet, but they were returned to him after a subsequent hearing he requested on the matter. Pieri’s wife hung up on a reporter when he called her and identified himself as a journalist. Pieri did not personally return a message seeking comment on Tuesday, but his attorney, Kim Borland, returned the call and left a message for the reporter. There was no answer at the office number Borland left and he did not return a subsequent message left on his cellphone voice mail. The discipline process As to what’s next for Pieri, a summons was issued for him to appear before District Judge Joseph D. Spagnuolo Jr. on March 29 for a preliminary hearing on the reckless endangerment, DUI and public drunkenness charges. In the meantime, Pieri, who has been licensed as a registered nurse since March 1979, remains employed by the VA Medical Center pending administrative action, although not in a patient care position. The Times Leader on Tuesday acquired an email from the Department of Veterans Affairs outlining the process. According to the email, the VA can take “a major adverse action that is appealable to a Disciplinary Appeals Board” related to alleged employee misconduct. A major adverse action includes a suspension, transfer, reduction in grade, reduction in basic pay, and discharge. After all evidence is obtained and an investigation is complete, a proposal notice must be drafted by Human Resources, and is typically reviewed by District Counsel before it’s issued to the employee. The employee has seven to 30 days to respond in writing, and the VA must issue a written decision within 21 days of the employee’s response. The employee has 30 days to appeal the decision. If that happens, a Disciplinary Appeals Board is appointed and has 120 days to conduct a hearing and issue a report. The Under Secretary for Health or Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health has 90 days to review the report and issue a decision to the appellant, the email states. The entire appeals process can take up to 270 days. That doesn’t sit well with U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “Almost every day we are reminded that the federal civil service system is designed to coddle and protect corrupt and incompetent employees and that the Obama administration’s refusal to address this dysfunctional status quo is doing real harm to veterans and taxpayers,” Miller said in a prepared statement. “The latest installment in this depressing saga is VA’s confirmation that it will take nearly a year at a minimum to discipline Pieri for something he’s already admitted to. Enough is enough,” Miller said. Miller said it’s time for VA to “get behind commonsense congressional proposals like the House-passed VA Accountability Act, which would enable VA to quickly purge corrupt and incompetent employees from the payroll and prevent convicted felons from sneaking out the back door with full taxpayer-funded pensions.” “Until then, situations like this, in which taxpayers are forced to subsidize bad behavior, will only continue,” Miller said. The VA Accountability Act would give the VA secretary the authority to swiftly fire or demote any employee for poor performance or misconduct while protecting whistleblowers and limiting the agency’s ability to place misbehaving employees on paid leave. It would also give VA the ability to recover annuities on pensions of VA employees convicted of felonies committed on the job. It passed the House in July 2015 and is pending in the Senate. http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_VA_logo.jpg Drums resident accused of assisting in surgery while drunk By Steve Mocarsky smocarsky@timesleader.com ||||| Travis Kellar | Times Leader Pieri - SCRANTON — The U.S. Attorney’s Office has assumed the case against a former nurse accused of participating in an emergency surgical procedure while drunk. Federal prosecutors on Friday charged Richard Pieri with reckless endangerment under the Federal Assimilated Crimes Act, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court. Pieri, prosecutors say, “did recklessly endanger another person by placing that person in danger of death or serious bodily injury by participating in a surgical procedure while under the influence of alcohol.” Pieri’s attorney, Shelley L. Centini, was not immediately available for comment Friday. Prosecutors say Pieri, 59, of Drums, staggered into the Wilkes-Barre VA Medical Center and aided in an emergency surgical procedure after drinking four or five beers at Mohegan Sun Pocono casino. He allegedly told police he forgot he was on call. Video surveillance obtained by police allegedly shows Pieri emerge from his Honda Ridgeline truck and collide with a concrete barrier while walking into the medical center just before midnight Feb. 4, nearly falling over several times. Pieri had been charged with misdemeanor counts of of reckless endangerment, DUI and public drunkenness, all of which were withdrawn by the Luzerne County District Attorney’s Office during a preliminary hearing last month before District Judge Joseph Spagnuolo. State officials suspended Pieri’s nursing license a day after he resigned from the hospital. The former nurse has a troubled past that included being charged in the 1985 hit-and-run death of 65-year-old veteran George Knorr near the hospital, which was adjacent to Pieri’s residence at the time.

[ii] Put them in a ziploc bag and place them in the freezer..","response":"I choose option [i] Put them in an air tight container and place the container in the fridge. Here is how I do this step-by-step: 1. First, obtain an air tight container that is appropriate for the quantity of anchovies you want to store. The container should be clean and preferably made of glass or food-grade plastic. 2. If the anchovies are in a can, transfer them carefully into the container in order to avoid damaging or mashing them. Preserve the oil from the can, as it will help to maintain the flavor and freshness of the anchovies. 3. If the anchovies are fresh, clean them first by removing their heads, gutting them, and rinsing them thoroughly in cold water. Then, arrange them neatly in the container. 4. If you are storing canned anchovies, cover the anchovies in the container with the oil from the can to create a protective barrier against air exposure. This will help to keep them moist and flavorful. 5. If you are storing fresh anchovies, it is recommended to add a layer of salt and a bit of olive oil to the container, as this will help to preserve them and extend their shelf life. 6. Seal the container by attaching the lid securely. Check that the container is air tight and that no air can get in, as this will help to maintain the freshness of the anchovies. 7. Lastly, place the container in the fridge. Store it at a temperature between 34°F to 40°F (1°C to 4°C) to ensure maximum freshness. Regularly check the anchovies to make sure that they remain in good condition. By following these steps, I can properly store anchovies and keep them fresh for future use. Storing them in the fridge in an air tight container provides an optimal environment for them, as it keeps them cool and protected from potential contaminants. This method allows for better preservation compared to storing them in the freezer, as freezing can alter the texture and flavor of the anchovies."},{"question":"Q: In this task, you will be given a list of numbers.

Again. The Terminator franchise stumbles out of the wreckage of the critically savaged sequel Salvation, this time with the participation of the original model, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the lavish endorsement of series co-creator James Cameron. Salvation “sucked” and Genisys, we’ve been told, is a new dawn. In this alternate timeline, the genius of 1984’s splendidly cheesy The Terminator and its sleek, superior follow-up Terminator 2: Judgment Day, are the only history that matters. It’s the kind of thing the fans want to hear. But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake, part reboot, mostly failure. Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchise’s roots and innovating for a new generation, instead, Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor’s sequel apes the first two films’ iconicism, but falls short of achieving any in its own right. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke), from the Terminator. Reese arrives in 1984 as per the original film, but – somehow (something about a “nexus”) – the timeline’s altered and in this reality it’s Sarah looking out for Kyle. They’re aided by a version of the Terminator (re-christened the Guardian and played by Schwarzenegger) that’s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child. She calls him “Pops”, while he – still, in any timeline you like, a machine – finds her affection baffling. Related: Hasta la vista, gramps! Arnie to shoot sixth Terminator as he nears 70 The first hour of the film sees Taylor recreating Cameron’s original in a style similar to Gus van Sant’s shot-by-shot remake of Psycho. There’s the yellow dump truck, a lookalike of its cigar-chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold, crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time-travelling orb. The punks are still there, still wondering what’s wrong with this picture. Kyle’s feathercut has gone, but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing. It’s an elaborate exercise in nostalgia that will delight the faithful and confuse the newcomer. The second half of the film is for them, where Genisys spins off into a peppy, self-aware parody of everything that made the early films unique. The lore is disconnected and rewired, making for a confusing, but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals. At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator: more ridiculous than revolutionary. Genisys – because of its 12A certification – lacks the first two chapters’ wallop. Cameron’s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning. The Terminator was murderous without thought, but with cause. The gore – the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or flaying an arm to prove a point – was grounded in the story. The slaughter of humanity felt real. There’s no fear here. No real sense of dread. The techno-paranoid get an Apple-ish operating system (the Genisys of the title) to worry about, but a tablet can’t inspire terror. The CGI doesn’t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day. The film feels soft and phoney. In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive: “They had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.” Watching Genisys, you can relate. Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands. It’s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes: the terrible robo-smile; the slang; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath. “Old, but not obsolete,” the Terminator/Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question. In truth, it feels like both. In a sense, the Terminator franchise wrote the code for Hollywood’s current creative stagnation. Judgment Day redefined the action genre, CGI and the star system, creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision-making today. It was a radical film, one that escaped the B-movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted. Cameron wasn’t scared to move on either. The penultimate scene – with the Terminator sacrificing himself to save the future – implied the director was quitting while he was ahead. Related: Terminator 5: how to reanimate the ailing sci-fi franchise Today – with our rebooted, rebooted Spider-Man and ever-expanding “cinematic universes” – not even death can kill a pop culture hero. Yet Genisys’s alternate universe yarn smacks of a particular desperation: the nuclear option in Hollywood’s War on Jeopardy. Cameron has called this “the official” third Terminator film, but it’s just another sequel. There’s talk of two more of these. They are on the production line, being built now to make our future just that little bit more drab. The war is over. The machines have won. Summary:","response":"\\"Terminator Genisys\\" is a movie that is part of the Terminator series with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is a famous actor and used to be a strong man. This movie is like a new start for the Terminator story. People were hoping it would be really fun and exciting like the first two Terminator movies, but it didn't live up to their expectations. Some parts of the movie were fun, but a lot of it was not as action-packed and exciting as people hoped for. People who have seen the earlier Terminator movies might enjoy this one, but it's not as good as the others."},{"question":"Given the question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said.

She has been nominated for 13 Emmy Awards and is one of the few entertainers to have won an Emmy Award, a Grammy Award, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award. She was the second black woman to win an Academy Award for acting. Goldberg's breakthrough role was Celie, a mistreated woman in the Deep South, Context: Goldberg has been married three times--in 1973 to Alvin Martin (divorced in 1979, one daughter), on September 1, 1986 to cinematographer David Claessen (divorced in 1988), and on October 1, 1994 to the union organizer Lyle Trachtenberg (divorced in 1995). She was romantically linked with actors Frank Langella, Timothy Dalton, and Ted Danson, who controversially appeared in blackface during her 1993 Friars Club roast. She has stated that she has no plans to marry again, commenting \\"Some people are not meant to be married and I am not meant to. I'm sure it is wonderful for lots of people.\\" In a 2011 interview with Piers Morgan, she explained that she never loved the men she married and commented: \\"You have to really be committed to them.

The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does? Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, Enterprise, which is not a red giant, has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader. In a red giant like Vader, hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel, and as a result, the fusion reactions now occur primarily in a shell surrounding the core. The expansion of the outer layers of a red giant contributes to the huge size and increased luminosity of the star. On the other hand, Enterprise is not a red giant, implying that it is likely in an earlier phase of its stellar life when hydrogen fusion reactions are still taking place in its core. Therefore, the amount of fusion reactions happening in the shell around the core of the Enterprise star would be significantly less compared to Vader."},{"question":"On Friday we can expect sunny weather Morning temperatures will be around 1 C During the day they will reach a maximum of 12 C Low temperatures at night will be around 1C We have weak southwesterly winds Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","response":"On Friday, we can expect sunny weather.

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: what is the largest major league sport in the world? Suggestion: The major professional sports leagues, or simply major leagues, in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the two countries. The answer is:","response":"False. The proposed suggestion is false as an answer to the question \\"what is the largest major league sport in the world?\\" While the suggestion does provide valuable information about the highest professional competitions of team sports in the United States and Canada, it does not address the specific question being asked. The question is looking for information on the largest major league sport in the world, implying it wants to find out which sport has the largest following, highest participation, or overall global presence. This could be determined by several factors including the number of fans, audience viewership, social media followers, participation rates, global presence, and so forth. Among the major sports worldwide, soccer (association football) is often considered the largest in terms of global following and participation. The FIFA World Cup, the sport's premier tournament, draws millions of viewers from around the globe. The sport is played in nearly every country, with leagues ranging from local amateur groups to the Premier League in England, La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy, and the Bundesliga in Germany among others, all of which command massive global followings and present considerable media and advertising influence. Other sports, like cricket and basketball, are popular in several countries and have significant followings as well. However, these sports do not have quite the same level of global reach that soccer does. To provide an accurate response to the question, one would need to expand beyond the geographic context of the United States and Canada and consider sports leagues throughout the world. Hence, the suggestion that only considers sports leagues in the United States and Canada does not effectively answer the question of which is the largest major league sport in the world. Therefore, the answer is false. It would be more appropriate to mention a sport rather than a general statement regarding sports leagues in specific regions."},{"question":"Singing is also associated with the Earth People in which the body too much or too little of the Earth to sing as often as possible whenever possible Add punctuation.","response":"Singing is also associated with the Earth People, in which the body, too much or too little of the Earth, sings as often as possible, whenever possible. Singing has long been a fundamental part of human culture and expression, transcending geographical, linguistic, and ethnic boundaries. Often referred to as the universal language, it allows individuals to connect and communicate with one another on an emotional and spiritual level. In various cultures, singing has played a critical role in channeling the Earth's energy and forming an intrinsic bond between the people and their environment. For the Earth People, the act of singing represents a deep connection to the land, the elements, and the community. From the bustling tribes of Africa to the isolated communities of the Pacific Islands, the Earth People have found solace and unity in song. Whether it's the throat-singing tradition of the Mongolian Tuvans or the lilting melodies of the Celtic bards, each culture has developed and utilized their unique vocal expressions to harness the power of their surroundings. With the body being both influenced by and influencing the world around it, singing often serves as a conduit for channeling the Earth's energy. Whether in times of joy, sorrow, or spiritual contemplation, the Earth People use music and song to connect with a powerful, universal energy force. This connection fosters a profound understanding of the natural world, with singing acting as a reminder of the symbiotic relationship between humans and the planet. In essence, singing aids the Earth People in maintaining balance in the face of adversity. When an individual experiences heightened emotions or overwhelming sensations, they may feel off-kilter, carrying either too much or too little of the Earth within them. In these moments, vocal expression becomes an invaluable tool in recalibrating one's energy and aligning oneself once again with the harmonious forces of the Earth. Many indigenous and tribal societies have long recognized the therapeutic benefits of singing, both individually and communally. Singing has often been a source of upliftment, a means of processing and releasing emotions, and a catalyst for forging vital connections to one's surroundings and others. As such, the Earth People encourage incorporating this powerful practice into daily life, utilizing song to foster a sense of balance, connection, and understanding of the natural world. To conclude, singing has remained an essential part of the Earth People's culture, serving as a means of connection, expression, and spiritual growth. The act of singing, both individually and collectively, enables these communities to harness powerful energies from the Earth, promoting a sense of balance, unity, and understanding among their people, and ultimately, embracing the rich tapestry of the human experience."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

Roosevelt (FDR) served. However, I can provide you with a detailed and long answer. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, commonly known by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States. He served from 1933 to 1945, making him one of the most memorable leaders in American history. FDR served an unprecedented four terms in office, which is more than any other president in U.S. history. FDR's long presidency can be divided into two main time periods: the Great Depression and World War II. He first took office during the Great Depression, implementing a series of programs and policies known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide relief for millions of Americans who were suffering due to widespread unemployment and economic decline. The New Deal included public works programs, financial reforms, and relief efforts – all designed to help the nation recover from the Great Depression. As his first two terms progressed, the U.S. began to see economic improvement. FDR was reelected for a second term in 1936, continuing his administration's efforts to strengthen the American economy. The New Deal expanded during his second term, with additional programs being implemented to further combat unemployment, poverty, and other social issues. During FDR's third term, which began in 1941, the United States entered World War II. FDR's leadership during the war focused on building a strong military presence, forming alliances with other nations, and implementing strategies to defeat the Axis powers. The war efforts helped to further improve the U.S. economy, as more jobs became available in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. FDR was reelected for a fourth term in 1944 despite concerns about his health. He continued to lead the United States during the final stages of World War II, working closely with allied leaders such as Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. However, FDR did not live to see the end of the war. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, just a few months into his fourth term. Vice President Harry S. Truman took over as President and led the United States through the conclusion of the war in August 1945. After FDR's unprecedented four terms in office, the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1951, limiting future presidents to serving a maximum of two terms."},{"question":"Translate \\"For that reason, he intends to establish a five-member expert financial advisory group composed of financial experts and eminent persons to provide the detailed and comprehensive advice required.\\" to French?","response":"Pour cette raison, il prévoit de créer un groupe consultatif financier de cinq membres composé d'experts financiers et de personnes très importantes pour donner les conseils détaillés et complets nécessaires.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? pick from the following. (i) Stick a fork into the stuffing of an oreo and dunk the oreo into the milk with the fork. (ii) Stick a pitch fork into the stuffing of an oreo and dunk the oreo into the milk with the fork.","response":"The correct answer is: (i) Stick a fork into the stuffing of an Oreo and dunk the Oreo into the milk with the fork.

Options: - toxic - uninhabitable - barren and airless - poisonous - obesity Please answer and provide answer explanation.","response":"Mercury building up in the bodies of certain fish can make them poisonous. Explanation: When mercury accumulates in high concentrations in fish, it can become toxic to humans and other wildlife that consume them. This occurs because mercury is a neurotoxin that can cause damage to the brain and nervous system when ingested in high amounts. As larger fish eat smaller fish containing mercury, the levels become concentrated and increase through the food chain, becoming especially problematic in larger, predatory fish species."},{"question":"având în vedere articolul 294 alineatul (3) din Tratatul privind funcționarea Uniunii Europene, Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Taking into account Article 294 paragraph (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Here, I have translated the given text from Romanian to English."},{"question":"TEXT: gage pushed me toward them as he took emily 's hand and led her outside with sky . after fawning over my ring , they shoved the pad of paper in front of me and all started talking at once . all i caught were the words , how soon , colors , and in the barn . \`\` wait , i 'm sorry , did you say in the","response":"Task: Summarize the information in the provided text and draft a plan to respond appropriately to the information.

The Zimbabwe Election Commission announced the results moments after the challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, denounced the voting, saying it had been rigged. âThis fraudulent and stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional, political and economic crisis,â Mr. Tsvangirai, who won 33 percent of the vote, said in a news conference at his house. He demanded that a new election be held so that Zimbabweans could âfreely and fairly elect a government of their choiceâ â a step that a spokesman for Mr. Mugabeâs party, ZANU-PF, quickly rejected. Secretary of State John Kerry also cast doubt on the validity of the election in a statement on Saturday. âIn light of substantial electoral irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers, the United States does not believe that the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people,â Mr. Kerry said. But regional election observers suggested that any flaws were not serious enough to invalidate the voting. The victory was a stunning comeback for Mr. Mugabe. After the disputed 2008 election, in which he won fewer votes than Mr. Tsvangirai did, he was forced into forming a unity government. This time, Mr. Mugabeâs party won more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, giving it a supermajority that can make changes to the countryâs Constitution without votes from other parties. The election was also a vivid illustration of how Mr. Tsvangiraiâs Movement for Democratic Change, or M.D.C., has been outmaneuvered and outfoxed at every turn by Mr. Mugabe, 89, a wily survivor who endured colonial rule, a brutal guerrilla war and multiple attempts to unseat him during his 33 years as Zimbabweâs leader. âThe party has been to blame for ZANUâs success across the board,â said Stephen Chan, a professor at SOAS, the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, who has written a biography of Mr. Mugabe. After the 2008 vote, the M.D.C. agreed to work with Mr. Mugabeâs party, but did not become an equal partner. âWhat they got was a compromise deal that was almost worse than being in opposition,â Mr. Chan said. One of the partyâs biggest missteps came in June, after Mr. Mugabe unilaterally declared that an election must be held by the end of July, just six weeks later, usurping Parliament. The M.D.C.âs leaders were prepared to tell the heads of state who had gathered for the meeting of the Southern African Development Community, a regional trade bloc, that the party would boycott the election. But the regional leaders at the meeting persuaded Mr. Mugabe to agree to ask the countryâs constitutional court for a two-week extension, and his main challenger for the presidency, Mr. Tsvangirai, agreed to go ahead with the election, according to Douglas Mwonzora, the M.D.C.âs spokesman. The courts refused to extend the deadline, and a messy, rushed election was held on Wednesday. âWe didnât expect the Zimbabwean courts and Mr. Mugabe to go against the resolution of S.A.D.C.,â Mr. Mwonzora said. It would turn out to be just one of a long list of miscalculations that have left the M.D.C., the most credible threat to Mr. Mugabeâs long rule, with not quite a third of the seats in Parliament and few options to contest the election results. Mr. Tsvangirai plans to go to court, but the higher courts in Zimbabwe are filled with Mr. Mugabeâs loyal appointees. The election results were a far cry from the 2008 vote, in which neither man won a majority. Mr. Tsvangirai then refused to participate in a runoff because of attacks that had killed hundreds of his supporters. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"Robert Mugabe secures another presidential term in Zimbabwe despite accusations of electoral fraud and rigging from his main challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, who demands a new election. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, wins more than two-thirds of parliamentary seats, enabling constitutional changes without support from other parties."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? that ca n't totally hide its contrivances","response":"The given review appears to convey a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer uses the phrase \\"that can't totally hide its contrivances,\\" which indicates that they feel the movie contains elements that seem artificial or forced. Contrivances in filmmaking refer to situations or plot devices that are not organic to the story but are rather created to advance the narrative or inject a certain emotion or theme. When a movie is unable to hide such forced elements, it can come across as poorly executed, inauthentic, or manipulative, leading to a negative viewing experience for the audience. Moreover, the reviewer seems to suggest that the movie has tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to conceal these contrivances. This further reiterates their dissatisfaction with the film, as it may indicate that they were not fully immersed in the story or could not connect with the characters due to these artificial elements. In conclusion, the review can be seen as negative because it highlights a significant flaw in the movie, namely its inability to completely hide the contrived aspects that impair the overall film experience for the viewer."},{"question":"Alexandre Sidorenko defeated Nick Lindahl ( 6 -- 3 , 7 -- 6 ) in the final .

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

Choices: - budding - nuclear fission - sexual reproduction - binary fission A:","response":"Bacteria reproduce primarily through a process called binary fission. In binary fission, a single bacterial cell, known as the parent cell, duplicates its genetic material (DNA) and then divides into two identical daughter cells. This is an asexual form of reproduction, meaning it does not require the exchange of genetic material between two different parent cells. The steps involved in binary fission are as follows: 1. Replication of DNA: The circular DNA molecule inside the bacterial cell replicates, creating two identical copies of genetic material. 2. Segregation of DNA: The replicated DNA molecules move to opposite ends of the cell. 3. Cytokinesis: The cell membrane and cell wall begin to grow inwards at the center of the cell, forming a septum that eventually divides the cell into two equal parts. 4. Separation: The two daughter cells separate, completing the binary fission process. Each daughter cell contains a complete copy of the parent cell's DNA and can continue to grow and divide. It's important to note that some bacteria are capable of exchanging genetic material through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction, but these methods are not the primary means of reproduction for bacteria. Instead, they serve as ways to create genetic diversity and promote adaptation within bacterial populations. So, the main mode of bacterial reproduction is binary fission."},{"question":"Keywords: airplane, come, window What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","response":"Step 1: Determine the context in which the keywords can fit together in a coherent manner. - Airplane: involves something related to air travel or an aircraft - Come: implies movement or the act of arriving - Window: refers to an opening within a structure to see through or allow light Step 2: Form a sentence that includes all these keywords and maintains clarity. - As the airplane comes closer, its reflection can be seen in the window.

One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association.

Send us your images, but please stay safe. Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt, including its capital Cairo, teetered on the edge early Thursday as clashes persisted following the bloodiest day since the revolution two years ago that was envisioned to bring peace and democracy to Egypt -- but has not. The violence Wednesday pitted Egypt's military and current government against backers of deposed President Mohamed Morsy, though others also were caught in the fray. At least 278 people were killed, including 235 civilians, state TV reported, citing an Egyptian emergency official. Interim Interior Minister Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim said that an additional 43 police officers died. \\"It's an open war,\\" said a protester who escaped one of two Cairo camps that were raided. The intensity and violence lingered into Thursday morning, when state TV reported Morsy backers were attacking police stations, hospitals and government buildings despite a government-mandated curfew. More Egyptian troops were being deployed at entrances to Cairo and Giza, with the unrest prompting the closure Thursday of banks and the nation's stock market. The 2011 revolution that led to the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, who'd kept a firm grip on power for 30 years, was followed by Egypt's first democratic elections. Morsy -- a leader of the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood -- won the presidency in that 2012 vote, but was forced out by the military last month. Morsy hasn't been seen since he was taken into custody. Yet his supporters have very public in voicing their opinions, massing on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere to slam military leaders and demand Morsy's return to the presidency. Egypt's new government refused to back down, criticizing elements of the protest movement and specifically ordering them to leave two spots where they'd been gathering in Cairo for six weeks, or else they'd force them out. On Wednesday, they did. Bloody 'war zone' as security forces clear Cairo square The story of what exactly transpired -- who attacked whom, who opened fire, who was to blame -- varied 180 degrees depending on where one stood in the debate over Egypt's past, present and future. On the one side, there were Morsy supporters, one of whom accused government forces of waging a \\"full-on assault\\" on what they said had been, to-date, peaceful demonstrations. On the other, there were those like Ibrahim, who professed to being \\"surprised\\" by the \\"Muslim Brotherhood's (decision) to attack the security forces.\\" What couldn't be mistaken was the chaos, the bloodshed and the sense -- even with Prime Minister Hazem Elbeblawi's pledge \\"we hopefully will rebuild our nation\\" -- that the already volatile situation in Egypt could be getting worse. \\"I think what we're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very, very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets,\\" CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Cairo. Diplomats condemn violence, calling it 'deplorable' The government on Wednesday, according to state TV, issued a month-long state of emergency. This a loaded term in Egypt, given that Mubarak long ruled under such a decree that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and let police jail people indefinitely. The prime minister said the government felt compelled to act to ensure stability, praising security forces for their \\"calm\\" and claiming some activists had intent to undermine the government. \\"We are here to build a democracy based on justice,\\" Elbeblawi said. \\"... We have to reason and use common sense. We are all part of this nation.\\" Yet not everyone expressed faith in his government. Mohammed ElBaradei -- a secular leader who was one of Morsy's biggest critics before joining the government that replaced him -- submitted his resignation Wednesday as vice president of foreign affairs, saying he didn't agree with decisions being carried out by the ruling government and \\"cannot be responsible for a single (drop of) blood.\\" His decision spurred scorn from some former allies, with youth groups and June 30th coalition members questioning his stepping down \\"at this critical and historic phase,\\" according to state-run EGYNews. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, sharply criticized \\"ongoing violence\\" by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in the country. He also chastised the government's crackdown on the Islamist group. \\"Didn't have to happen,\\" Roth tweeted. \\"MB had right to protest. No need for massive lethal force.\\" World urges Egypt to show restraint, protect civilians The European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, urged \\"security forces to exercise utmost restraint and ... the interim government to end the state of emergency as soon as possible, to allow the resumption of normal life.\\" In light of the ongoing violence, the United States is considering canceling next month's planned biennial military training exercise with Egyptian forces, an official in President Barack Obama's administration said. Pressing Egypt's government \\"to respect basic human rights,\\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Wednesday's \\"deplorable\\" events \\"run counter to Egyptian aspirations for peace, inclusion and genuine democracy.\\" \\"The path toward violence leads only to greater instability, economic disaster and suffering,\\" he said. 'They're prepared to die' For weeks, the two makeshift Cairo protest camps had become cities unto themselves -- with people sleeping in tents, vendors hawking everything from haircuts to masks, and children playing in inflatable castles and splashing in kiddie pools. At dawn on Wednesday, they came under siege. Security forces rushed in, bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds. Some mothers and fathers managed to whisk away their children, gas masks on their faces. Within three hours, the smaller camp -- Nahda, near Cairo University -- was clear, except for shreds of torn-down tents that remained. But the larger protest, near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in eastern Cairo, proved trickier. Facing heavy resistance, the military called in special forces. Chaos ensued. Along with smoke, bursts of rapid gunfire filled the air, as did people's wails. Many protesters refused to leave, even in the face of bulldozers and surrounded by the injured and dead. \\"They said they're prepared to die,\\" CNN's Reza Sayah reported. State TV reported that snipers from the Muslim Brotherhood -- Morsy's party -- exchanged gunfire with Egyptian security forces near a university building. The dead included cameraman Mick Deane, who'd worked for UK-based news channel Sky News for 15 years and for CNN before that. Habiba Abdel Aziz of Gulf News, who was in Egypt on her own time having celebrated the Eid holiday, also died, editor-at-large Francis Matthew told CNN. And Reuters photojournalist Asmaa Waguih was shot and wounded, the news agency told CNN. She was being treated in a hospital. 'Walking on the blood of the victims' Ibrahim, the interim interior minister, claimed armed protesters were the aggressors -- including trying to storm police stations, the Ministry of Finance building and other targets in Cairo. The fighting wasn't limited to the capital. Morsy backers reportedly besieged churches in Sohag, setting fire to Saint George's Church, a tour bus and a police car, EGYNews said. Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian billionaire who helped found the anti-Morsy Free Egyptian Party, said his party had video of Muslim Brotherhood members \\"shooting machine guns on civilians, on police. So anyone who wants to call this a peaceful demonstration would be wrong.\\" But Ahmed Mustafa, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, told CNN that Sawiris was trying to misrepresent video of masked people with weapons. Besides claiming they'd been shot at, the Muslim Brotherhood also accused police of throwing Molotov cocktails at makeshift clinics. Security forces pushed doctors out of one hospital at gunpoint, a witness said, and a CNN crew at one point was \\"literally walking on the blood of the victims.\\" Yet Ibrahim said government forces had done what they could to limit casualties, with his ministry insisting, \\"Egyptian security forces are committed to the utmost self-restraint in dealing with the protesters.\\" Divisions rife, future uncertain in Egypt Rather than uniting Egypt after Mubarak's fall, divisions remained rife -- and, in some ways, intensified -- during Morsy's time as president. Critics accused him of being authoritarian, trying to force the Brotherhood's Islamic agenda, not being inclusive and failing to deliver freedom and justice. 'Nail in coffin' for Arab Spring? The military coup to dismiss him, they said, was necessary since Morsy didn't fairly represent all Egyptians. So, too, were the efforts to force his supporters off the streets. \\"We believe in human rights,\\" said Shehab Wagih, a spokesman for the Free Egyptian Party speaking in favor of the military. \\"But at the same time, we cannot accept the idea of having a state inside a state.\\" Morsy's backers, meanwhile, accuse the military -- and the government it appointed -- of undermining the people's will, as expressed at the polls. The deposed president wasn't given a fair chance, they say, and his supporters have been unfairly targeted for expressing their opinion. Talking Wednesday on CNN, Abdul Mawgoud Dardery of the pro-Morsy Anti-Coup National Alliance blamed \\"corrupt elements\\" in the Egyptian army for the bloodshed, calling their actions a \\"crime against humanity\\" and \\"state terrorism.\\" \\"All presidents make mistakes, but you don't have the army to remove them,\\" Dardery said of Morsy. \\"... What are we telling to the rest of the Arab world, the Muslim world -- that bullets are better than ballots?\\" Opinion: Morsy holds key to Egypt's future CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo; CNN's Greg Botelho and Josh Levs reported from Atlanta; CNN's Saad Abedine, Holly Yan, Barbara Starr, Ali Younes, Slma Shelbayah and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report. ||||| Sky News cameraman Mick Deane has been shot and killed in Egypt this morning.

The escalating violence poses a challenge to the Obama administration, which refused to declare it a coup when Egypt's military toppled Mohamed Morsi, who had been democratically elected president. A growing number of lawmakers are raising concerns that the Egyptian military is ignoring U.S. calls for moderation as it continues to crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood, which is alligned with Morsi. President Obama was briefed about the latest violence at Martha's Vineyard, where he is vacationing. National Security Adviser Susan Rice briefed Obama, who then headed out for a vacation round of golf. The White House said Obama would receive subsequent briefings later on Wednesday. The U.S. embassy in Cairo announced via Twitter that it would remain shuttered after closing early on Wednesday amid the unrest. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said actions taken by Egypt's military run \\"directly counter to pledges\\" by the interim government to \\"respect basic rights.\\" \\"We will continue to hold the interim government accountable for the promise they have made to speed the transition to a civilian democratic government,\\" Earnest said, calling the violence a \\"step in the wrong direction.\\" The White House spokesman wouldn't detail what form that accountability would take, but stressed that administration officials had been in contact with their counterparts in Egypt in the buildup to the crackdown and said conversations would continue in the coming days to \\"remind them of the promises they have made.\\" Earnest would not say whether the president or any other senior administration officials had called officials in Egypt in the immediate aftermath of the violence. Labeling the military's ouster of Morsi a coup which would have automatically frozen the 1.3 billion in annual military aid to the country. By not calling it a coup, the adminsitration believes it will preserve U.S. leverage and contracts with Americans arms-makers. Earnest repeated on Wednesday that the White House was not likely to make a determination about whether a coup had occurred. \\"It has been determined by senior foreign policy officials in this administration to not make a determination\\" on the subject, Earnest said. The violence comes days after Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) met with military leaders in Egypt and urged them to hold new elections and quickly shift to civilian rule. McCain said on Sunday that Congress should consider cutting aid to Egypt if the military violently cracked down on the protesters. “If they go ahead and crack down in a violent way,” McCain told Fox News, “I’m afraid the Congress of the United States would have to consider carefully the elimination of aid.” The United Nations quickly condemned in the “strongest terms” the army's move against pro-Morsi sit-ins that has left dozens dead, as did the British government. “The Secretary-General condemns in the strongest terms the violence today in Cairo that occurred when Egyptian security services used force to clear Cairo of sit-ins and demonstrations,” Ban Ki-moon's spokesman said in a statement. “While the UN is still gathering precise information about today's events, it appears that hundreds of people were killed or wounded in clashes between security forces and demonstrators.” British Foreign Secretary William Hague shared similar sentiments in a statement carried by the British embassy in Washington. “I am deeply concerned at the escalating violence and unrest in Egypt, and regret the loss of life on all sides,” Hague said. “The UK has been closely involved in intensive diplomatic efforts directed at reaching a peaceful resolution to the standoff. “I am disappointed that compromise has not been possible. I condemn the use of force in clearing protests and call on the security forces to act with restraint. Leaders on all sides must work to reduce the risk of further violence. Only then will it be possible to take vital steps towards dialogue and reconciliation.” — This story was first posted at 10:54 a.m. and has been updated. ||||| Protesters throw stones at Egyptian security forces trying to clear a sit-in by supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in the eastern Nasr City district of Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, Aug....

At least 235 people were killed in all, including at least 43 police, and 2,000 wounded, a health official said, in fierce clashes that spread beyond Cairo to towns and cities around Egypt. Deposed president Mohamed Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood said the death toll of what it called a \\"massacre\\" was far higher. While bodies wrapped in carpets were carried to a makeshift morgue near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, the army-backed rulers declared a one-month state of emergency, restoring to the military the unfettered power it wielded for decades before a pro-democracy uprising toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said 43 police were among the dead. Security forces had completely cleared two protest camps in the capital and would not tolerate any further sit-ins, he said, vowing to restore Mubarak-era security. Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi defended the use of force, condemned by the United States and European governments, saying the authorities had no choice but to act to end \\"the spread of anarchy\\". \\"We found that matters had reached a point that no self-respecting state could accept,\\" he said in a televised address. The authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Cairo and several other cities including Alexandria, Egypt's second city on the Mediterranean coast. The use of force prompted Mohamed ElBaradei, a former U.N. diplomat and the most prominent liberal supporter of Mursi's overthrow, to resign as vice president, saying the conflict could have been resolved by peaceful means. \\"The beneficiaries of what happened today are those call for violence, terrorism and the most extreme groups,\\" he said. Thousands of Mursi's supporters had been camped at two major sites in Cairo since before he was toppled on July 3, and had vowed not to leave the streets until he was returned to power. The assault, ending a six-week stand-off, defied international pleas for restraint and a negotiated political solution. Straddling the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route, Egypt is a key U.S. ally at the heart of the Middle East and was the first Arab state to make peace with Israel. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon all deplored the use of force and called for the state of emergency to be lifted as soon as possible. VIOLENCE SPREADS A U.S. official told Reuters that Washington was considering cancelling the biennial \\"Bright Star\\" joint military exercise with Egypt, due this year, after the latest violence, in what would be a direct snub to the Egyptian armed forces. Violence rippled out from Cairo, with Mursi supporters and security forces clashing in the cities of Alexandria, Minya, assiut, Fayoum and Suez and in Buhayra and Beni Suef provinces. The bloodshed also effectively ended for now the open political role of the Brotherhood, with the harshest crackdown on a movement that survived underground for 85 years to emerge after the 2011 uprising and win every election held since. Security officials initially said senior Brotherhood figures Mohamed El-Beltagi and Essam El-Erian had been arrested, joining Mursi himself and other Brotherhood leaders in jail, but later acknowledged they had not been captured. Beltagi's 17-year-old daughter was among the dead. Beltagi warned of wider conflict, and urged people to take to the streets to oppose the head of the armed forces, who deposed Mursi on July 3 following mass protests. \\"I swear by God that if you stay in your homes, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will embroil this country so that it becomes Syria. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will push this nation to a civil war so that he escapes the gallows.\\" ElBaradei's political movement, the anti-Islamist National Salvation Front, did not share his qualms, declaring that \\"Egypt has held its head high in the sky announcing victory over political groups that abuse religion\\". Since Mursi was toppled, the security forces had twice before killed scores of protesters in attempts to drive Mursi's followers off the streets. But they had held back from a full-scale assault on the tented camp where followers and their families have lived behind makeshift barricades. After the assault on the camp began, desperate residents recited Koranic verses and screamed \\"God help us! God help us!\\" while helicopters hovered overhead and armored bulldozers ploughed over their makeshift defenses. Reuters journalists on the scene saw masked police in dark uniforms pour out of police vans with sticks and tear gas canisters. They tore down tents and set them ablaze. \\"They smashed through our walls. Police and soldiers, they fired tear gas at children,\\" said Saleh Abdulaziz, 39, a secondary school teacher clutching a bleeding wound on his head. DEAD BODIES, SMASHED SKULLS After shooting with live ammunition began, wounded and dead lay on the streets among pools of blood. An area of the camp that had been a playground and art exhibition for the children of protesters was turned into a war-zone field hospital. Seven dead bodies were lined up in the street, one of them a teenager whose skull was smashed, with blood pouring from the back of his head. At another location in Cairo, a Reuters reporter was in a crowd of Mursi supporters when he heard bullets whizzing past and hitting walls. The crowd dived to the ground for cover. A man was killed by a bullet to the head. The government insists people in the camp were armed. Television stations controlled by the state or its sympathizers ran footage of what appeared to be pro-Mursi protesters firing rifles at soldiers from behind sandbag barricades. Reuters journalists and other Western media did not witness such incidents. The crowds appeared to be armed mainly with sticks, stones and concrete slabs against police and troops with rifles. The violence was the worst in Egypt since war with Israel in 1973 and forces tough decisions upon Egypt's Western allies, especially Washington, which funds Egypt's military with 1.5 billion a year and has so far refused to label the army's overthrow of Mursi a \\"coup\\". \\"The United States strongly condemns the use of violence against protesters in Egypt,\\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \\"We extend our condolences to the families of those who have been killed, and to the injured. We have repeatedly called on the Egyptian military and security forces to show restraint.\\" \\"We also strongly oppose a return to a State of Emergency law, and call on the government to respect basic human rights such as freedom of peaceful assembly, and due process under the law. The world is watching what is happening in Cairo.\\" The United States and Europe had pressed hard for Egypt's generals not to crush the demonstrators. A diplomatic effort to open talks between the Brotherhood and the authorities, backed by Washington, Brussels and Arab states, collapsed last week. CHURCHES TORCHED Outside of Cairo, state media said Mursi supporters had besieged and set fire to government buildings and attacked several churches. Christians, who make up 10 percent of the population of 85 million, have feared reprisals from Islamists since the Coptic Pope Tawadros endorsed the military takeover. Among the dead in Cairo were at least two journalists. A Reuters photographer was shot in the foot. At a makeshift morgue at the camp field hospital, a Reuters reporter counted 29 bodies, with others still arriving. Most had died of gunshot wounds to the head. A 12-year-old boy, bare-chested with tracksuit trousers, lay out in the corridor, a bullet wound through his neck. His mother was bent over him, rocking back and forth and silently kissing his chest. One of the nurses was sobbing on her hands and knees as she tried to mop up the blood with a roll of tissue. Adli Mansour, the judge appointed president by the army when it overthrew Egypt's first elected leader on July 3, announced a state of emergency for one month and called on the armed forces to help police enforce security. Rights activists said the move would give legal cover for the army to make arrests. Turkey urged the U.N. Security Council and Arab League to act quickly to stop a \\"massacre\\" in Egypt. Iran warned of the risk of civil war. The European Union and several of its member countries deplored the killings. Mursi became Egypt's first freely elected leader in June 2012, but failed to tackle a deep economic malaise and worried many Egyptians with apparent efforts to tighten Islamist rule. Liberals and young Egyptians staged huge rallies demanding that he resign, and the army said it had removed him in response to the will of the people. Since he was deposed, Gulf Arab states have pledged 12 billion in aid, buying the interim government valuable time to try to put its finances back in order. By late afternoon, the campsite where Mursi's supporters had maintained their vigil for six weeks was empty. One man stood alone in the wreckage reciting the central tenet of Islam through a loudspeaker: \\"There is no God but Allah.\\" He wept, and then his voice broke off into silence.

Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces.

When plants grow in zinc-deficient soils, they become more susceptible to diseases. Major regions with zinc-deficient soil include about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and these areas have shown positive responses to zinc fertilization. Zinc is naturally added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but human activities have also contributed to its presence.

British and American warplanes pounded targets to support a 1,000 Marine force. A Marine statement also said patrols in the devastated city of Fallujah came under attack Sunday. According to the statement, 15 insurgents were killed while the attack was repulsed. Hypothesis: Fallujah is not far from Karabilah.","response":"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not explicitly stated whether the hypothesis \\"Fallujah is not far from Karabilah\\" is true or false. However, we can analyze the context, and derive some insights from the given information. The paragraph conveys that a surge in violence is taking place near Karabilah while U.S. Marines and Iraqi troops fight against insurgents. Furthermore, British and American warplanes are providing support for the military operations. The information about Fallujah being under attack somewhat indicates it might be related to the conflict in Karabilah. Yet, the paragraph does not clearly state the distance or direct relation between the two locations. We can infer that the events in Fallujah and Karabilah are possibly connected since they are both mentioned within the context of U.S. Marines' encounters with insurgents and because warplanes were used to support military operations. This might suggest that Fallujah and Karabilah are in proximity to each other, considering the shared military resources and strategy. However, without further information or evidence, we cannot definitively confirm the truth of the hypothesis. It would require additional data, such as geographical context or specified distance between the two locations, to establish the validity of the statement \\"Fallujah is not far from Karabilah.\\" Until then, the hypothesis remains unproven based on the given paragraph."},{"question":"Amanda Bynes has nothing to hide.

The 27-year-old's Twitter account was once the place where headlines were made, as she would post questionable and at times disturbing messages occasionally involving other celebrities. But since her release from an in-patient treatment facility in December, where she spent four months under involuntary psychiatric hold, Bynes has cleaned house. All of the old tweets have been banished, and in their place are brief, run-of-the-mill updates along with a smattering of older photos. \\"Hi everyone!

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are less or more ): Ulysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, then back up. His ship is subjected to less or more temperature and pressure at the surface? A:","response":"As Ulysses pilots his drill ship deep into the Earth's core, and then back up, his ship is subjected to changes in both temperature and pressure based on the depths reached during the journey. When comparing the conditions at the Earth's surface to those deeper within the planet, we can determine how the temperature and pressure vary. Temperature and pressure increase as we go deeper into the Earth. This is due to the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements and the residual heat from Earth's formation. Additionally, the pressure increases because of the weight of the overlying rocks and materials. The deeper we go, the higher the temperature and pressure become. At the Earth's core, which lies about 6,371 kilometers beneath the surface, the temperature is estimated to reach around 5,000 to 7,000 degrees Celsius (9,000 to 12,600 degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure is approximately 3,500,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. These conditions are extreme and significantly higher than the conditions encountered at the Earth's surface. Upon Ulysses' return, his ship will experience a reduction in both temperature and pressure as he nears and reaches the Earth's surface. The temperature and pressure at the Earth's surface are considerably lower compared to the extreme conditions experienced at the core. Therefore, the correct answer to the given question is: Ulysses' ship is subjected to less temperature and pressure at the surface."},{"question":"they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you Does it follow that \\"They think they will always lose.\\"?

Based on the information provided, it does not follow that \\"They think they will always lose.\\" In fact, the statement suggests the opposite – that they possess a strong, persistent belief in their ability to win. This mindset is, according to the speaker, how it should be. The assertion that \\"they always think they can win\\" highlights an unwavering confidence and determination that has likely developed from past experiences, knowledge, and skills. This outlook is valuable since it helps them remain focused and motivated even during challenging situations. It can have a positive impact on their performance and increase their chances of success.

Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing. By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album \\"more clunky than funky\\". Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song \\"Get Loose\\" as \\"snappy\\", writing that although the lyrics are \\"inane\\", \\"the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up.

After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer Ice was the world's No. 6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship. Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now \\"picking up the pieces\\". Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records. He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song \\"Boom\\" by Bloodhound Gang on their CD One Fierce Beer Coaster.","response":"This text is about Robert Matthew Van Winkle, also known as Vanilla Ice, an American rapper, actor, and television host.

His job was to talk to people from other countries and make friends with them. He had a big responsibility because he wanted to make sure everyone was getting along and taking care of each other. One day, the Foreign Secretary went to a special four-day meeting called a summit. A summit is like a big party where important people gather to talk about serious things. This very special summit was about something called \\"sexual violence in conflict.\\" That means when some mean people hurt others in a very bad way, especially during fights between countries or groups. The Foreign Secretary really wanted to stop this from happening. He knew he had to defend and protect people who were hurt because they didn't deserve it. So he talked to very important people and even famous actors and actresses from Hollywood. They all got together and took pictures to show that they cared about people who were hurt and wanted to make the world a better place. While all of this was happening, there was a big problem in a country called Iraq. The Foreign Secretary wanted to help there too, so he made sure to talk about it and figure out how to make things better at the same time. He was doing a lot of work, but he didn't let anyone down! Then, one day, a man from a radio station called \\"R4\\" talked to the Foreign Secretary. His name was John Humphrys. He asked the Foreign Secretary some questions about the summit, but the Foreign Secretary thought some of the questions were not very smart. That made him a little bit upset. But the Foreign Secretary didn't let that stop him from doing his job. He kept going to the summit and worked hard every single day to make the world a better place. And that's the story of how the Foreign Secretary tried his best to help people who were hurt and why he took pictures with movie stars to show everyone that they cared about making the world a safer and happier place for everyone to live in.

Let's examine each sentence to better understand the difference in meaning. - In the first sentence, \\"Mailed an indignant letter to the editor,\\" the word \\"letter\\" refers to a written or printed message, usually put on a piece of paper, and sent to a recipient. In this context, the \\"letter\\" typically includes a greeting, body, and closing, describing the sender's thoughts, concerns, or feelings. The term \\"indignant\\" suggests that the letter contains strong feelings of anger or annoyance about unfair treatment, and it is addressed to the editor, implying that it's sent to a newspaper or publication as a response to something printed in it. - In the second sentence, \\"A blood letter,\\" the word \\"letter\\" is a part of a compound word, \\"bloodletter,\\" which has a different meaning altogether. A bloodletter is a historical term referring to a person who practiced bloodletting, a medical procedure in which a small amount of blood is removed from a patient to treat or prevent illness. Bloodletting was based on the belief that draining off a portion of the patient's blood could balance bodily humors, helping to cure diseases or restore health. It's worth mentioning that bloodletting is an outdated practice and not used in modern medicine. In conclusion, the word \\"letter\\" in these two sentences takes on different meanings. In the first one, it refers to a written message sent to an editor, while in the second, it's part of a compound word referring to a person who performed bloodletting.

Are \\"He\\" and \\"Fred\\" the same?","response":"In the given sentence, \\"Steve follows Fred's example in everything. *He* influences him hugely,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" is indeed referring to \\"Fred.\\" Pronouns are used as substitutes for nouns, often to avoid repetition or to improve the clarity of a sentence by indicating a specific antecedent. In this case, the antecedent for \\"he\\" is \\"Fred.\\" The context of the sentence provides enough information to deduce that \\"he\\" is in fact referring to Fred. The reason why we can conclude this is that the sentence structure suggests that the individual being emulated or followed by Steve is also the one influencing him significantly. Additionally, \\"Fred\\" is the only male noun mentioned before the pronoun \\"he.\\" To analyze and better understand this sentence, we can break it down into two main clauses: 1. Steve follows Fred's example in everything. 2. He influences him hugely. In the first clause, it is evident that Steve admires and follows Fred's actions or choices. The possessive noun, \\"Fred's example,\\" implies that Fred sets a pattern or exhibits behavior that Steve imitates. The second clause, using the pronoun \\"he,\\" refers to the person who has a significant impact on Steve, which, judging by the antecedent, is Fred. Therefore, it is deduced that \\"he\\" and \\"Fred\\" are the same in this sentence, with \\"he\\" being a pronoun that represents \\"Fred.\\" To summarize, based on the context and sentence structure, \\"he\\" and \\"Fred\\" are the same in the sentence, \\"Steve follows Fred's example in everything. *He* influences him hugely.\\" Pronouns play a crucial role in providing coherence in sentences and ensuring that the intended message is clear and concise."},{"question":"Sentence 1: It was produced by Cameron Crain , Richard Shelgren and Kamala Lopez and directed by Kamala Lopez .

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wound is dirty happens, how will it affect LESS SEVERE disease occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"If a wound is dirty, it can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process, leading to a less severe disease. When a wound gets contaminated with dirt or other substances, it can affect the body's response to the infection and the infection itself in several ways. Here's a detailed explanation of how a dirty wound may lead to a less severe disease, considering the process you provided: 1. Skin is cut or damaged: When the skin is cut or damaged, it loses its natural barrier against the outside environment, including harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The presence of dirt in the wound area may introduce additional foreign particles and bacteria, which then have direct access to underlying tissues and blood vessels. 2. Bacteria enter through the wound: Bacteria present in the dirt can easily enter the wound, along with some other dirt particles. Usually, the immune system will respond to these invaders accordingly. However, some of the less harmful bacteria in the dirt may actually be competing with more harmful bacteria and limiting their growth (competitive exclusion). In this case, a dirty wound could potentially help reduce the severity of the disease, as the less harmful bacteria can suppress the growth of the more dangerous pathogens. 3. Bacteria reproduce and spread: When bacteria enter the wound, they reproduce and spread, initiating an immune response. As mentioned earlier, the presence of other less harmful bacteria in the dirty wound can compete for resources with more dangerous pathogens, which can slow down their growth rate. This decreases their ability to colonize and infect the surrounding tissues quickly, which may result in a less severe disease. 4. Causes symptoms: The presence of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from the damaged tissue and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the bacteria can trigger an immune response, leading to inflammation and other symptoms. The immune system may respond more strongly to a dirty wound to eliminate the foreign particles and various bacteria. So, the presence of less harmful bacteria and foreign particles in the wound can lead to a relatively mild response, reducing the overall severity of the disease. 5. The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease: The immune system may successfully fight off the infection in a dirty wound, or it may develop into a disease. However, due to the competition between less harmful and more harmful bacteria, the overall impact of bacteria in a dirty wound may be less severe than if only harmful bacteria were present. By limiting the growth of the more aggressive bacteria, the less harmful microorganisms can indirectly contribute to a less severe disease. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis where the wound is dirty can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, potentially leading to a less severe disease. The presence of less harmful bacteria and other particles in the wound may contribute to a reduced bacterial growth rate, a milder immune response, and a lower likelihood of developing a severe infection. However, it's essential to note that dirty wounds also carry a higher risk of complications and severe infections, so proper wound care and treatment are crucial."},{"question":"Context:It is one of those days following one of those nights . The kind of night that finds me wanting to crawl into bed at 7 and find a sense of peace in a book or in sleep .

It is there ; it is sometimes more difficult to find than others , but it is there all the same . Question Why is the narrator in bed so early at night ? Answer:","response":"The narrator finds themselves in bed so early at night due to a combination of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as the desire to seek solace and comfort from their current state of mind. The passage mentions that these kinds of nights don't happen often, implying that this is not the narrator's usual routine, and indicating that there is some underlying reason or stressor that has driven them to retreat to their bed at such an early hour. There are several possible reasons why the narrator might be experiencing this emotional and mental turmoil. The passage alludes to the narrator trying to \\"sort through the gray and the mist\\" and find a silver lining in their situation. This suggests that they may be grappling with feelings of confusion, sadness, or even helplessness. It is possible that the narrator is struggling with personal issues or challenges in their life, such as work-related stress, relationship troubles, or financial concerns. Additionally, the mention of \\"gray and mist\\" also implies a sense of emotional fog, making it difficult for the narrator to clearly see or identify the source of their distress. This could lead to further feelings of vulnerability and unease, as they are unable to comprehend or address the cause of their emotional state adequately. In seeking refuge and comfort in their bed, the narrator might be trying to escape or avoid facing these difficult emotions. They prefer to find solace in activities like reading or sleeping, which allow them to momentarily disconnect from their troubles and delve into a different world or find temporary respite through slumber. Essentially, the bed serves as a safe haven for the narrator, where they hope to regain a sense of peace and emotional stability. Moreover, the narrator's determination to find the \\"silver lining\\" in their situation highlights their optimistic outlook and resilience, even in challenging times. It is this belief and the pursuit of finding something positive in the midst of difficulty that might help the narrator cope with their emotional struggles and eventually overcome the sense of despondence or despair.

Anomalies in the parochial system, they had no church or clergymen and were therefore exempt from payment of poor or church rates and usually tithes. They were formed for a variety of reasons, often because an area was unpopulated or unsuitable for agriculture, but also around institutions and buildings or natural resources. Extra-parochial areas caused considerable problems when they became inhabited as they did not provide religious facilities, local governance or provide for the relief of the poor. Their status was often ambiguous and there was demand for extra-parochial areas to operate more like parishes. Following the introduction of the New Poor Law, extra-parochial areas were effectively made civil parishes by the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857 and were eliminated by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1868. This was achieved either by being integrated with a neighbouring or surrounding parish, or by becoming a separate civil parish if the population was high enough. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county.

As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

She carefully examined the various choices of wood paint brushes, taking into account their bristle stiffness, brush sizes, and shapes. Alice knew the importance of selecting the right tools for her artwork, as it could significantly impact the overall effect and outcome of her paintings. Step 1: Examining the brushes This step is important because selecting an appropriate brush ensures that Alice will be able to create the desired textures and strokes in her artwork. Step 2: Considering various factors of the brushes These factors include bristle stiffness, brush size, and shape. Each of these factors can affect Alice's ability to execute specific techniques and create desired effects on the canvas. Once Alice had weighed her options, she eventually decided to go with a set of round, natural hog bristle brushes. They seemed to be versatile enough for the vast array of painting techniques she was looking forward to experimenting with. Step 3: Selecting a set of brushes to purchase Choosing a versatile set of brushes is important because it gives the artist the ability to create diverse effects and techniques for their artwork. Purchasing her new set of wood paint brushes, Alice couldn't wait to get back to her studio and start creating. Inspired by the nature surrounding her quaint rural home, she prepped her canvas and paints.

In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ariidae or ariid catfish are a family of catfish that mainly live in marine waters with many freshwater and brackish water species . They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones . The family includes about 143 species . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'ariidae'?

She has a fascination with panthers, but animals don't seem to like her very much. When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird. While in the pet store, Irena's presence sets all the animals to caterwauling. Several weeks later, the bird dies in fear when Irena reaches for it in its cage.Irena is haunted by a tale from her country that tells how the people of her village were witches, devil worshippers, and, under strong emotions like jealousy or anger, could change into panthers. She refers to them as the 'cat people.' Oliver takes it as a folktale, but Irena takes it for real, so real that she refuses to sleep with her husband because she believes that she might kill him.Oliver suggests that Irena see a psychiatrist, so she goes to see Dr Louis Judd [Tom Conway], who was recommended to Oliver by his co-worker, Alice Moore [Jane Randolph].

Survivors work on the farms using primitive hand-held farming tools Answer:","response":"Title: Harvest of Hope Genre: Drama, Adventure, Sci-Fi Plot: In the not-too-distant future, Earth has been ravaged by wars, climate change, and scarce resources, leaving the vast majority of its population struggling to survive. Amidst the chaos, pockets of survivors have banded together to form self-sustaining communities. One such community, The Refuge, has successfully created a flourishing agricultural haven amidst the desolation. The story revolves around a diverse group of survivors who work together in The Refuge's farms using primitive hand-held tools, as the advanced technologies once used in farming have either been destroyed or are no longer functional. Many of the survivors come from different walks of life and countries, and must put aside their differences to collectively overcome the challenges they face in the new world. Our protagonist, Noah, an agricultural engineer before the collapse, takes on the responsibility of leading the farming community. With his knowledge of farming and soil science, he teaches the survivors how to maximize crop yields using the limited resources they have. Together with his friend, Maya, a former botanist, they discover and cultivate a new resilient crop that helps sustain the community and eventually becomes their primary currency in a barter-based economy. As the story progresses, there are internal conflicts between the survivors due to differing views on leadership, resource distribution, and their obligations to other struggling communities. A stubborn group of people, led by Joseph, advocates for a more isolationist approach, hoarding their food and resources instead of sharing them with newcomers and surrounding communities. Tensions escalate when a rival community, The Pioneers, threatens The Refuge, seeking to take control of their flourishing farms. Noah and the other survivors must band together to protect their land and resources, simultaneously grappling with the ethical dilemma of whether they should share their farming knowledge and bountiful crops with a community that might eventually threaten their survival. As The Pioneers close in, Noah unveils his best-kept secret: a stockpile of scavenged solar-powered farming equipment that he's been repairing during his spare time. With this newfound advantage, the farmers of The Refuge are able to dramatically increase their productivity and have enough surplus to negotiate a truce with The Pioneers. The film concludes with a tense and hopeful union of the two communities, forging an agreement to share their resources and knowledge in an attempt to rebuild civilization and turn the desolate world into a more hospitable place. Although the future remains uncertain, the survivors learn that by working together, they can overcome adversity and create a hopeful path forward."},{"question":"Data: name = Alimentum, food = Japanese, priceRange = high, customer rating = 3 out of 5, area = city centre, near = Yippee Noodle Bar.

How to clean a room fast Identify your goal in cleaning a room. Cleaning means different things to different people. You're going to have to identify, first, exactly what you want to do.","response":"Once you have determined your cleaning objectives, follow these steps to ensure a fast and efficient room cleaning process: 1. Gather all necessary cleaning supplies: Save time by gathering all required cleaning supplies before starting. This might include a vacuum cleaner, broom, dustpan, mop, cleaning cloths, a duster, glass cleaner, disinfectant, and trash bags. Having everything within reach will prevent you from running back and forth, looking for items while you clean. 2. Declutter the space: Begin by removing any clutter from the room. This may involve picking up scattered toys, clothes, or items that are not in their designated places. Create separate piles for items to be discarded, donated, or put in storage. Clearing the clutter first makes it easier to clean surfaces and allows you to see the areas that require attention. 3. Dust surfaces and fixtures: Starting from the top and working your way down, dust all surfaces, including furniture, shelves, and window sills. Don't forget to dust light fixtures, ceiling fans, and any other high-up objects. This ensures that any dust that falls to the floor will be picked up when you sweep, vacuum, or mop later. 4. Wipe down surfaces: Using a damp cleaning cloth, wipe down all the surfaces in the room. Make sure to clean light switches, doorknobs, baseboards, and any other areas that are often touched but may be overlooked during regular cleaning sessions. For glass or shiny surfaces, use a specialized glass cleaner to prevent streaks. 5. Tackle floors: Depending on the flooring type in the room, you might need to vacuum, sweep, or mop. For carpeted floors, vacuum thoroughly using appropriate attachments for edges and corners. Hard surfaces like wood, tile, or laminate require sweeping first, then mopping with a suitable cleaning solution. Don't forget to move furniture or rugs to reach hidden areas, and maintain a methodical approach to make sure you cover the entire floor. 6. Organize as you go: As you're cleaning the room, take the opportunity to reorganize items that are out of place. Put books back on shelves, fold and store clothes, and arrange any decorative items to enhance the room's appearance. Implementing an organization system now will make future cleanings even faster. 7. Empty trash cans and replace liners: Don't forget to empty and clean any trash cans in the room. Replace liners and ensure that they are firmly secured, so they don't slip down or come loose during use. 8. Add finishing touches: After the room is clean and organized, add some finishing touches to make the space more inviting. Light a scented candle, open a window for fresh air, or adjust lighting to create a pleasant atmosphere. By following these steps and maintaining a clear vision of your cleaning goals, you'll be able to clean a room quickly and efficiently, leaving it spotless and organized for your enjoyment."},{"question":"Information: - Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are involved in making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represents about half of all cases of muscular dystrophy, affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word \\"dystrophy\\" is from the Greek \\"dys\\", meaning \\"difficult\\" and \\"troph\\" meaning \\"nourish\\". Gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek \`\` muscle '' , \`\` weakness '' , and Latin : gravis \`\` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is a neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue . In the most common cases , muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions . Alternatively , in a much rarer form , muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing through passive transmission from the mother 's immune system at birth or through autoimmunity later in life . Myasthenia is treated with medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ( surgical removal of the thymus gland ) . The disease is diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million per year . Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Muscle weakness or myasthenia (my- from Greek meaning \\"muscle\\" + -asthenia meaning \\"weakness\\") is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years). - A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a nerve cell (neuron) whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects. Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons. - Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis. - Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. - Weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. - Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body. - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Myasthenia gravis is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required. Myasthenia gravis affects 50 to 200 per million people. It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek \\"muscle\\" and asthenia \\"weakness\\", and the \\"serious\\". - Inflammatory myopathy (inflammatory muscle disease or myositis) is disease featuring weakness and inflammation of muscles and (in some types) muscle pain. The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs and electromyography, MRI and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). - An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed \\"polyelectrolytes\\", which contain charged functional groups. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as \\"lytes\\". - A neuromuscular junction (or myoneural junction) is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction. - Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles, either directly, being pathologies of the voluntary muscle, or indirectly, being pathologies of nerves or neuromuscular junctions.

Hypothesis: Many ancient caravans stopped in Jaisalmer for the night before traveling on with their goods. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"Yes, the premise appears to entail the hypothesis to a certain extent. Let us break both the premise and hypothesis down to provide a detailed explanation and analyze the connection between them. Premise: 1. Location: Jaisalmer is situated on the route of ancient caravans. 2. Origin and destination: The caravans carried goods from the Middle East and Central Asia. 3. Fortification: Jaisalmer is a sandstone citadel, protected by a double set of bastions, and is situated in the Thar Desert. 4. Impression: The citadel appears like a mirage in the sands. Hypothesis: Many ancient caravans stopped in Jaisalmer for the night before traveling on with their goods. Now, let's analyze the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. 1. The premise states that Jaisalmer was on the route of ancient caravans. This fact supports the likelihood that caravans would have stopped at Jaisalmer since it was a convenient location along their path. 2. The fortification of Jaisalmer could imply that it was a secure place for the caravans to rest for the night. A secured citadel with double sets of bastions would provide protection against potential threats in the area. Caravans might prefer such a location for their overnight stay to ensure the safety of their goods and personnel. 3. The premise also mentions the origin and destination of the caravans - they carried goods from the Middle East and Central Asia. This information is not directly related to the hypothesis, but it helps to paint a picture of the long journeys these caravans undertook. Caravans traveling to or from such distant places would require multiple stops along the way for rest and supplies, so it's reasonable to assume that they might have stopped at Jaisalmer. Considering all the points mentioned above, it is quite plausible that many ancient caravans stopped in Jaisalmer for the night before continuing with their journey. Thus, the premise does entail the hypothesis to some extent, by providing information about the citadel's location, fortification, and connection to the ancient caravan routes."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: \\"Just Be\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare; \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year . - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries. - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085). - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella. - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina. - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085). - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270 6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' . - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way.

In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

The death rate at two hospitals fell by 15 per cent after nurses were given electronic devices in place of handwritten paper notes to record patients’ heart rates and breathing. Researchers calculated that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at the two hospitals, Queen Alexandria in Portsmouth and University Hospital in Coventry. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed: There is no suggestion that these nurses have illegible handwriting (File photo) Across the NHS, this means 37,000 deaths could be avoided if nurses were given the devices rather than relying on traditional handwritten notes from nurses. At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed. Often these readings aren’t taken regularly enough and in some patients there are gaps of between eight and 12 hours between measures. In other cases, nurses handwriting is illegible or they don’t note down all the figures meaning it is not clear for their colleagues to monitor patients. To address the problem of poor handwriting, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth (above) To address the problem, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth in 2005 and at University Hospitals in Coventry in 2007. They were handed either iPhones or iPads – small computers – installed with an app that takes patients readings and reminds nurses when they are next needed. An alert flashes up on the screen if patients are deteriorating and in some cases they will urge nurses to summon a doctor. Researchers compared the death rates for every year from 2004 – before the devices were used – to 2010. They annual death rates fell by 397 at Portsmouth and by 372 deaths at University Hospitals Coventry in 2010 compared to 2004. Dr Paul Schmidt of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, one of the leaders of the project, said: ‘Observing patients and making accurate records provides a safety net to guard against their deterioration. ‘We believed traditional paper charts were not doing the job well enough so we designed an electronic system to support staff. This study shows its introduction was followed by a significant drop in deaths.” Dr Duncan Watson of University Hospital Coventry, who also worked on the project, said: ‘This technology improves the performance of routine but important tasks and frees up clinical staff to do what only human beings can do – care for patients.” Many of the deaths avoided would have occurred in the elderly who had developed pneumonia or infections which would otherwise have been spotted too late. Typically they cost around £500,000 to roll out across a medium-sized hospital trust and about 40 are now using them in at leat one department. Summarize the highlights of this article.","response":"1. Many patients in hospitals are dying each year due to errors in monitoring, bad handwriting, or mathematical mistakes made by nurses, as per a study. 2. The use of electronic devices, replacing handwritten paper notes, for recording patients' information significantly reduced the death rate by 15% in two selected hospitals. 3. The study revealed that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at Queen Alexandra in Portsmouth and University Hospital in Coventry by using electronic devices. 4. Across the NHS, it's estimated that 37,000 deaths could be avoided every year if nurses transitioned to using electronic devices for patient monitoring, instead of handwritten notes. 5. Many hospitals have discrepancies in monitoring, with some patients having gaps between eight and 12 hours in measurements. Illegible handwriting or incomplete information also causes issues. 6. The solution undertaken included providing nurses at both hospitals hand-held devices, such as iPhones or iPads, with an app that records patient readings and notifies nurses when the next reading is due. 7. The app also alerts medical personnel if a patient's health is deteriorating, which can allow timely medical intervention. 8. The implementation of this new system led to a decreased annual death rate in both hospitals - 397 fewer deaths at Portsmouth and 372 less at University Hospitals Coventry in 2010 compared to 2004. 9. This technology assists in completing routine tasks more accurately, and in turn, provides medical staff more time to deliver personalized patient care. 10. Most of the lives saved were mainly elderly patients with pneumonia or infections which could have been detected too late. 11.

Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.\\"? Answer:","response":"Question: In the passage, what did Eliot, Martineau, and their circle find appealing about Auguste Comte's ideas, and how did these ideas influence the works of Victorian novelists and poets such as George Eliot and Thomas Hardy?"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: what is cu the element I found the following answer on Google: Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is indeed correct but only provides a glimpse of the significance and properties of copper. To give you a more comprehensive understanding, let me provide you with a detailed and long answer. Copper, represented by the symbol \\"Cu\\", is a chemical element with the atomic number 29. It is classified as a transition metal in the periodic table due to its properties which include high ductility, malleability, and its ability to conduct electricity and heat. Copper has a unique reddish-orange hue, making it easily distinguishable from other elements. Additionally, it is one of the few elements that exist naturally in its metallic state and is found in various minerals such as chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, and native copper. The element has been known and used by humans for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations. Among its many applications, copper has been employed for making tools, weapons, jewelry, and building materials. Due to its electrical and thermal conductivity properties, copper remains a significant component in the modern-day manufacturing of electrical wiring, electronics, and various industrial applications. Regarding the often-overlooked biological aspect of copper, it is an essential trace element for all living organisms, as you mentioned in the answer you found. Copper plays a vital role in maintaining proper metabolic functions, red and white blood cell development, immune system regulation, and the synthesis of essential proteins. One of the primary roles copper plays in our metabolism involves its presence in the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. This enzyme is necessary for cellular respiration, a process through which cells convert oxygen and nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, which provide energy for all cellular functions. In addition, copper acts as a cofactor in a wide range of other metalloenzymes – enzymes that contain a metal atom, which is vital for their function. Still, it is crucial to note that copper, although necessary for life, can be toxic in excessive amounts. The human body is adapted for maintaining an equilibrium of copper ions – absorbing only what is needed and excreting the excess. However, certain conditions can lead to an imbalance, causing health issues. In summary, the answer you found is correct, but it's crucial to understand that copper is not only involved in the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase but also in a wide range of physiological processes and applications. Being an essential trace element, copper plays a significant role in biology, industry, and human history."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Classify the relation of question with context to one of these categories: 1) award received, 2) based on, collection, 3) conflict, 4) constellation, 5) convicted of, 6) date of death, 7) director, 8) drafted by, 9) educated at, 10) medical condition, 11) military branch, 12) narrative location, 13) occupation, 14) original network, 15) parent company, 16) point in time, 17) production company, 18) residence, 19) series, 20) service entry, 21) sex or gender, 22) spouse, 23) standards body question.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, \\"the Prince\\" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening.

The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the Valley experiences less soil erosion compared to the Gorge. The factors contributing to this conclusion can be analyzed by examining each aspect of the two regions mentioned in the description. 1. Deforestation: The Gorge has been subjected to deforestation, which leads to numerous negative consequences, including soil degradation and increased erosion. When trees are removed from an area, their roots no longer hold the soil together, leaving it susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Additionally, trees play a crucial role in the water cycle by absorbing water from the soil and releasing it into the atmosphere as water vapor. This process prevents the soil from becoming saturated with water, which can contribute to reduced erosion. In contrast, the Valley still has abundant trees and bushes, providing stability to the soil and reducing erosion. 2. Fertility and plant cover: The Valley has more fertile soil than the Gorge. Fertile soil supports a greater variety of plants and vegetation, which in turn helps prevent erosion by binding the soil together with their roots. The abundant plant life also slows down water runoff, reducing the force at which the water impacts and dislodges soil particles. 3. Overgrazing: The Gorge may be overgrazed, which means that too many animals are grazing in the area. Overgrazing leads to the destruction of plant life and the loss of root structure in the soil, which makes it more prone to erosion. The Valley, on the other hand, is not overgrazed, preserving its plant cover and reducing soil erosion. 4. Biodiversity: The Valley has a higher level of biodiversity than the Gorge. This is likely due to the more favorable environmental conditions – fertile soil, abundant plant life, and a lack of overgrazing – that promote a healthy ecosystem. A varied ecosystem with a diverse array of plant and animal life can create a more resilient landscape that is less prone to erosion and other environmental issues. 5. Soil composition and retention: The Valley's soil is not only more nutritious but also better at retaining water, nitrogen, and carbon. These characteristics contribute to a healthier ecosystem and reduce soil erosion by promoting strong plant growth and helping the soil bind together. High water retention capabilities in the soil can also prevent excessive runoff and reduce erosion caused by water flow. In conclusion, the Valley experiences less soil erosion due to factors such as the presence of abundant trees and bushes, fertile soil, limited overgrazing, a diverse ecosystem, and the soil's retention capabilities. These factors create a more resilient landscape, protecting the soil from erosion and maintaining a healthier environment. In contrast, the Gorge suffers from negative consequences of deforestation and overgrazing, making it more vulnerable to soil erosion."},{"question":"as his self-described \`\` coming out '' two-week tour of america concluded in miami , salman rushdie enjoyed memories of new-found , if still limited , freedom .
