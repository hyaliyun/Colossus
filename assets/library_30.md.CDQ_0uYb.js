It is part of the larger Ozark Mountain AVA, which also includes regions in Missouri and Oklahoma. The smaller Altus AVA is entirely contained within the Arkansas Mountain AVA. The Arkansas Mountain AVA includes 2880000 acre , making it the ninth largest AVA as of 2008. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas has many large waterfalls.","response":"While the Arkansas Mountain AVA is indeed located within the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, the information provided mainly focuses on the wine industry and its geographical specifications. It does not mention or provide any data concerning the presence or size of waterfalls in the region. To properly assess the presence and size of waterfalls in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we must consider additional information on the region's natural landscape and geological features. The Ozark Mountains, also known as the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic region in the United States that covers parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The region is characterized by its unique geomorphology, consisting of plateaus, deep valleys, rivers, and springs. It is common for such geological formations to create waterfalls as water flows from higher elevations to lower ones, causing the erosion of soft rock layers and creating steep drops. Some of the river systems in the Ozarks, including the Buffalo National River, contain picturesque waterfalls. Northwestern Arkansas, where the Arkansas Mountain AVA is located, is a part of the Boston Mountains, which are the highest and most rugged portion of the Ozarks. The region is abundant in water resources due to the presence of numerous rivers, such as the Buffalo, Mulberry, and Kings rivers, as well as many smaller creeks and tributaries. These rivers and streams give rise to numerous waterfalls throughout the area, some of which are well-known, such as Triple Falls, Glory Hole, and Hemmed-in Hollow Falls. There are also many lesser-known, smaller waterfalls scattered throughout the region. Given the information regarding the landscape features of the Ozark Mountains, particularly the presence of many rivers, creeks, and tributaries, in addition to the region's rugged terrain in the Boston Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, we can conclude that the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas possess a significant number of waterfalls. However, the provided data about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly relate to the conclusion, as the AVA's focus is mainly on viticulture, not the presence or size of waterfalls. In summary, though the information provided about the Arkansas Mountain AVA does not directly address or support the conclusion, additional information about the Ozark Mountains' geology and hydrology does indicate that there are numerous waterfalls in the area. However, the sizes of the waterfalls may vary, ranging from large, well-known ones to smaller, less celebrated cascades."},{"question":"Here is a premise: No, Mr. White. Here is a hypothesis: The man's last name was White. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"In order to determine if the premise supports the validity of the hypothesis, we need to examine both the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, and then analyze their logical connection. The premise given is: \\"No, Mr. White.\\" This statement indicates a denial, refusal, or disagreement with something related to an individual referred to as Mr. White. However, the statement does not provide ample context or information. It is unclear what is being denied or to what aspects of Mr. White's situation the remark is referring. On the other hand, the hypothesis provided is: \\"The man's last name was White.\\" This hypothesis is a statement about a specific individual, asserting that he has the last name 'White.' To conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not based on the given premise, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the two of them. If we analyze the premise and hypothesis, we can see that both statements involve someone with the last name 'White.' The premise directly refers to a person called 'Mr. White,' while the hypothesis states that a man has the last name 'White.' However, the initial statement that says, \\"No, Mr. White\\" only provides a negative response or denial to an unknown request or action involving someone named Mr. White, and does not give any information about the man's identity or personal information. It does not confirm, nor deny, the hypothesis directly. Based on this analysis, we cannot firmly conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The premise, while involving a person named Mr. White, does not give any specific information about the man or his last name, and therefore, cannot be used to definitively support or disprove the hypothesis. We would need more context and information in order to draw a stronger connection between the premise and hypothesis for a valid conclusion."},{"question":"Objective: How to Make a Non Toxic Wood Furniture Polish Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I will outline both the solutions and discuss the naive physics reasoning behind them. After assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each solution, it will be easier to determine which one is more sound. Solution 1: A Homemade Olive Oil and Lemon Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1 cup of olive oil - 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice Procedure: 1. Mix the olive oil and lemon juice in a glass jar or a spray bottle. 2. Shake the container well to combine the ingredients, as the oil and lemon juice are immiscible liquids and may separate. 3. Apply a small amount of the polish to a clean, soft cloth or microfiber cloth. 4. Gently rub the cloth onto the wood furniture in circular motions, working on small sections at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for a few minutes, then buff with a clean cloth to reveal a natural shine. 6. Store the remaining polish in a cool, dark place for future use. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses olive oil, a natural substance with conditioning properties that nourish and protect the wood. The lemon juice adds a light, fresh scent and provides mild cleaning properties that help remove surface dirt. Together, these ingredients create a simple yet effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that gives a natural shine without causing damage to the wood or leaving harmful chemical residues. Solution 2: A Homemade Beeswax and Coconut Oil Furniture Polish Ingredients: - 1/4 cup of beeswax pellets or grated beeswax - 3/4 cup of coconut oil Procedure: 1. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the beeswax. Be sure not to let the water come into direct contact with the beeswax. 2. Once the beeswax has melted, add the coconut oil. Stir gently until the coconut oil has melted and combined with the beeswax. 3. Remove the mixture from heat and let it cool slightly. Pour the liquid into a glass jar and allow it to solidify. Once cooled, it will form a thick paste. 4. To use, apply a small amount of the polish with a clean, soft cloth, working in circular motions and covering small sections of the wood at a time. 5. Allow the polish to absorb into the wood for about 30 minutes. 6. Buff the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any excess polish and reveal a protective, natural shine. Naive Physics Reasoning: This solution uses beeswax and coconut oil, both natural substances that have conditioning and protective properties. Beeswax helps seal and protect the wood, while coconut oil nourishes and moisturizes the surface. The combination of these two ingredients creates a highly effective non-toxic wood furniture polish that provides long-lasting protection and a lustrous shine without exposing the wood or the user to harmful chemicals. Conclusion: Based on naive physics reasoning, both solutions can effectively polish and protect wood furniture without using toxic chemicals. However, the beeswax and coconut oil furniture polish (Solution 2) seems to be a more sound solution, as it provides a long-lasting protective barrier and a more durable shine. The olive oil and lemon polish (Solution 1) may require more frequent applications due to the quick-absorbing nature of olive oil and the mild cleaning action of lemon juice. Ultimately, both solutions are non-toxic and suitable for maintaining wood furniture, but Solution 2 is preferred for its sturdiness and extended protective qualities."},{"question":"Is this product review positive?

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"Bribing someone is an unethical and generally illegal act, and I do not condone or support it. Instead, I encourage you to approach situations in a fair, honest, and transparent manner. However, I can provide you with information on how to influence and persuade someone ethically and professionally. Here is a detailed outline of ethical persuasion techniques: 1. Build rapport: Establishing a connection and trust with the person you want to influence is key. Be genuinely interested in their perspective, empathetic towards their concerns, and respectful of their opinions. 2. Understand their needs and motivations: Invest time in learning about the person's goals, aspirations, and values. This allows you to present your ideas or requests in a way that aligns with their interests and addresses their concerns effectively. 3. Use effective communication skills: Be clear, concise, and articulate when presenting your ideas. Use evidence, anecdotes, or examples to back up your claims and create a compelling argument. Additionally, use open questions that encourage dialogue, allowing you to even understand and address any objections they might have. 4. Demonstrate credibility: Show your knowledge, expertise, and reliability in the subject matter you're discussing. This can be done by providing facts, statistics, or examples that substantiate your point while also displaying your passion and commitment to the issue. 5. Appeal to emotions: As humans, we are often driven by our emotions. Understand the emotional aspects of your case and evoke feelings such as empathy, pride, or urgency. Connect your argument to their core values and beliefs to create a stronger impact. 6. Create a sense of urgency: People are more likely to act if they perceive a time constraint or fear missing out on a valuable opportunity. Emphasize the importance of acting now or outline the potential consequences of inaction. 7. Offer solutions: People are more likely to buy into your idea if you provide them with a viable solution to their problem. Present the benefits of your suggestion clearly and emphasize how it would improve their current situation. 8. Reach a consensus: Find common ground and emphasize points of agreement. Make the person feel like they are part of the decision-making process by encouraging collaboration and shared ownership of the idea or project. 9. Practice patience: Persuasion takes time and effort. Be prepared to engage in multiple conversations or meetings before you secure a commitment. Remain persistent, confident, and open to feedback throughout the process. By applying these ethical persuasion techniques, you can build strong relationships and achieve desired outcomes without resorting to bribery or any other form of unethical behavior."},{"question":"This article: The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land.

Fruit, which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts, is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it, incidentally scattering the seeds it contains (see frugivory). Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely, flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction, spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did mutualistic relationships spread to eventually become?","response":"Mutualistic relationships, through the process of seed dispersal by animals consuming fruits, eventually spread to become the dominant form of land plant life. This essentially means that plants managed to use animals to their advantage, ensuring their seeds were spread further and more efficiently. In biology, mutualism is the way two organisms of different species exist in a relationship in which each individual benefits. In this case, the plant and the animal constitute the two organisms. The plant benefits by having its seeds dispersed over a wide area, resulting in higher chances of continual survival and proliferation of its species. The animal, on the other hand, benefits from the food resource which is the fruit or flower part. Hence, creating a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties. Flowering proved to be a notably efficient means of reproduction which eventually led to this form of mutualism. Through gradual ecological changes and evolution, flowering plants — also known as angiosperms, developed a trait that helps in attracting animals, which is their fleshy, nutritious fruits. When beings like birds, insects, or mammals consume these fruits, they inadvertently help in the transportation of seeds. The movement of animals, whether through flying, walking, or other means, allows the seeds to be dispersed in many different locations, sometimes quite far from the parent plant. If the consumed seeds aren't fully digested and can remain viable after passage through the digestive tract of the animal, they can potentially germinate and grow in the new location when excreted. Over time, the spreading of this mutualistic relationship between plants and animals became more widespread and eventually resulted in such angiosperms becoming the dominant form of land plant life. This innovative means of seed dispersal has allowed flowering plants to colonize a vast array of environments and niches across the globe more effectively than other plant groups. This global pervasiveness of angiosperms is a testimony to the overwhelming success of these mutualistic relationships."},{"question":"The Olmecs were the earliest known major civilization in Mexico following a progressive development in Soconusco. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring Mokaya or Mixe-Zoque. The Olmecs flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre- While the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 Michael D. Coe speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors. In 1976, linguists Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a Mixe-Zoquean language into many other Mesoamerican languages. Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec - generally regarded as the first \\"highly civilized\\" Mesoamerican society - spoke a language ancestral to Mixe-Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies. Mixe-Zoque specialist Soren Wichmann first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe-Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period after the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period. However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe-Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque. At least the fact that the Mixe-Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the Olmec heartland, and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe-Zoquean languages. were their any other languages?","response":"Yes, there is a possibility that the Olmecs were exposed to or spoke other languages besides the Mixe-Zoquean languages. Mesoamerica was a culturally and linguistically diverse region, with multiple ethnic groups and languages coexisting and interacting throughout its history. Although Mixe-Zoquean languages are the most likely candidates for the Olmec's primary language based on current evidence, it is important to note that the Olmecs had extensive trade networks and interactions with various neighboring cultures and civilizations, such as the Maya, the Zapotec, and the Teotihuacan. This exposure to multiple cultures could have led to a multilingual environment where multiple languages were spoken and understood by the Olmec people. For example, the presence of Mayan inscriptions and iconography in some Olmec sites suggests that some Olmecs might have known or had some understanding of the Mayan language. Similarly, there must have been some level of communication between the Olmecs and their trading partners from distant regions, which could have necessitated the use of other languages or the development of a pidgin or trading language. Moreover, the Olmec civilization has often been dubbed \\"the mother culture\\" of Mesoamerica, as many later civilizations borrowed or adopted various elements of Olmec culture, religion, and iconography. This cultural exchange also implies a certain degree of linguistic interaction and exchange between the Olmecs and other Mesoamerican groups. In summary, while the prevailing hypothesis suggests that the Olmecs spoke Mixe-Zoquean languages, it is likely that they were also familiar with or spoke other languages due to their extensive trade networks, interactions with neighboring cultures, and the borrowing of Olmec cultural elements by later civilizations. Further archaeological and linguistic research may shed more light on the full extent of the Olmec's linguistic diversity and interactions with other Mesoamerican languages."},{"question":"if you know the name of wrong dll like brparimg.sys, choose free download--saving money.

During Alison's pregnancy she had strong cravings for cookies but didn't like pancakes because the","response":"texture and smell made her feel nauseous. The complexity of expecting mothers' desires and food aversions remains a fascinating aspect of pregnancy, especially considering the individuality of each woman's experiences. For the most part, pregnancy cravings are a natural aspect of the journey into motherhood, and may very well hold significant meaning to the body's needs. The developing fetus may require certain nutrients throughout the growth process that trigger the mother's cravings for specific foods. Oftentimes, these cravings might lean towards sugary snacks or carbohydrates, which provide the much-needed energy boost that expecting mothers so often seek during this physically taxing time. As for Alison, her craving for cookies might have emerged due to the rich content of sugars, which can provide immediate energy, as well as essential macro and micronutrients. For instance, almonds and other nuts found in various cookie types contain good fats, vitamins, and minerals that contribute to the mother's overall health. Furthermore, the emotional aspect of food cravings ought not to be ignored, as it offers comfort and eases the stress of the impending colossal change in her life. In contrast, food aversions, or heightened sensitivity towards particular odors and tastes, are also commonly experienced during pregnancy. These aversions are likely a protective mechanism, helping prevent the mother from ingesting potentially harmful substances that may compromise the health of the baby. While the sensation of nausea may prove rather unpleasant, it is important to remember that this is nature's way of safeguarding the mother and the growing fetus. In Alison's case, her aversion to pancakes may have been triggered by either the inherent sweet aroma or the texture that made her feel nauseous. Although pancakes are generally regarded as harmless, the consistency of the batter might have reminded her of other, unpalatable textures that her heightened sensitivity could not accept. Moreover, it is common for the taste preferences of pregnant women to change significantly over time, and Alison's change in her preference for pancakes could very well be a result of that phenomenon. It should also be noted that this new blend of food cravings and aversions is a temporary phase, and the majority of these desires subside after pregnancy. In many cases, the mother's pre-pregnancy taste preferences re-emerge, and these new sensations gradually fade into memory. In conclusion, Alison's cravings for cookies and aversion to pancakes during her pregnancy are examples of the unique and fascinating experiences faced by expectant mothers. These cravings and aversions are the body's natural way of guiding pregnant women towards obtaining the appropriate nutrients and protecting the developing baby. Alison's experience is a testament to the individuality and mystery that surrounds the beautiful and complex experience of pregnancy, showcasing the adaptability and resilience of motherhood."},{"question":"Definition: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

The atmosphere is lively and filled with anticipation, as a prominent ship is about to embark on a long and perilous journey across the vast and dangerous ocean. A young sailor named Johanna, who recently joined the crew, is secretly a woman disguised as a man. She has been searching for answers about her true identity after discovering a mysterious letter amongst her late father's belongings. The letter hinted at a dark family secret, a past entwined with the legendary and feared \\"Siren of the Sea.\\" Unbeknownst to the crew, Johanna is a descendant of this mystical figure. Facing a lifetime of prejudice and judgement, she assumes a male identity to pursue her quest for the truth about her heritage—defying the societal expectations of her time and risking her own safety. Act II: As the ship embarks on its journey, the intricate web of relationships amongst the crew members begins to unravel. Johanna's resourcefulness and incredible seamanship skills catch the eye of the gruff, yet wise ship captain, Captain Victor Grey. He takes Johanna under his wing and becomes her mentor. Throughout the voyage, the crew encounters both treacherous storms and marine creatures of fierce wonder as they navigate through the open ocean. Johanna becomes close friends with a fellow young sailor named Thomas, a kind-hearted dreamer with a penchant for storytelling. Johanna, driven by her desire to uncover the truth and inspired by her friendships, begins to trust those around her more openly. One stormy night, the ship gets caught in a whirlpool, which leads them to the hidden and mystical \\"Siren's Cove\\"—a place forgotten by time and cloaked in mystery. Here, the crew encounters strange and otherworldly beings with powerful siren-like qualities. Among these beings is a wise and ancient siren named Orenda, who reveals the truth of Johanna's heritage and helps her understand the nature of her unique abilities. Act III: As they set to leave the Siren's Cove, disaster strikes when a notorious pirate ship, captained by the ruthless Black Anne, attacks them. A fierce battle ensues, and Johanna's true identity is revealed during the conflict. Captain Grey is gravely injured, and it's up to Johanna to harness her newfound powers to save the crew and defeat the pirate threat. Johanna is embraced by the crew for her courage and sacrifices, but she knows that returning to Portside Landing would mean a return to the life of oppression and judgment she sought to escape. She voluntarily hands over the captain's hat to Thomas. In a heartfelt farewell, Johanna decides to stay behind in the Siren's Cove, where she can continue to unravel her past and explore the limits of her powers. Thomas, now in charge of the ship, leads the remaining crew back to their home, where they vow to keep Johanna's secret and honor her memory as a brave and loyal sailor. The film closes with the crew of the ship, now bonded by their experiences, sailing toward the horizon—with Johanna's spirit forever in their hearts. Throughout the film, Johanna's journey and persistence in following her own path, despite all the odds against her, remind the viewer of the importance of remaining true to oneself, even in the face of tremendous adversity."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: How many points were scored in the first half?","response":"As an AI assistant, I don't have real-time access to specific sports events score data or ability to pull statistics from a certain game that might be ongoing or completed recently.

It tells us the location and a basic description of the individual. He is in a military accessories store, which typically sells items related to the military, such as uniforms, insignia, tactical gear, and other military-themed items. The large man is sitting, but we are not given any information about what he is doing or why he is there. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"A man is shopping for some gifts,\\" is a separate scenario. This statement implies that the man is actively browsing and selecting items with the intention of giving them as gifts. However, we have no information in the first statement that indicates the man's intentions, nor do we have any information regarding his actions beyond the fact that he is sitting. There could be multiple reasons for why the large man is sitting in a military accessories store, including: 1. He could be the owner or an employee of the store, taking a break or managing the store. 2. He could be waiting for someone else who is shopping for military accessories. 3. He might be tired or resting, unrelated to any shopping activities. 4. He could be browsing or contemplating a purchase without necessarily intending to buy a gift. Without more context, it is not possible to determine whether the large man is shopping for gifts or even engaged in the act of shopping at all. Therefore, the initial statement does not logically imply that the man is shopping for gifts based on the limited information provided."},{"question":"I can use this background: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions.

Thelma is married to a moronic hothead named Darryl (Christopher McDonald), and she is too timid to even tell Darryl that she is going away for the weekend.

Just what is McDonald's McDonald's trying to accomplish by involving itself in the horrible story of three young women held captive for over a decade in a Cleveland house? The fast-food behemoth says it wants to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the heroic neighbor who kicked apart a door to free Amanda Berry, helped her call 911, and then gave a vivid, witty, and ultimately viral account of what happened to a local TV reporter. Explaining his sudden acts of heroism, Ramsey noted that he was “eating my McDonald’s” when he heard shouting from his neighbor’s house and sprang into action. McDonald’s came up in the 911 call too. McDonald’s says it is responding to an outpouring of social media requests that it honor or reward Ramsey somehow. Well, OK. But really, it’s the most tenuous of connections. Had Ramsey been eating a kruller from Dunkin’ Donuts, texting on a Samsung phone, or playing an XBox game (or all of those things) at the time Berry started yelling for help, would those respective corporations be expected to queue up to laud him? This is treacherous territory, because McDonald’s cannot be seen as capitalizing on a series of terrible crimes. And yet, it’s not really clear it can completely avoid that. Basking in the reflected light of Ramsey’s heroism may be one step removed, but one step removed is still pretty damn close. There are also issues of class lurking underneath the surface here, given the nexus of cheap-tasty-unhealthy fast food and the public health problems that lower-income communities face. Food corporations are desperate to promote public health and lighten up their menus. Giving Charles Ramsey a lifetime supply of Big Macs helps no one. But giving him a lifetime supply of Fruit and Walnut Salads might be seen as opportunistic or patronizing. (Unless he happens to really, really like McDonald’s Fruit and Walnut Salads.) And during a time when corporations are taking on more quasi-public functions, from slapping their names on stadiums and running prisons and municipal agencies, this only shows the limits of the trend. Really, it’s the community – the city of Cleveland – that should take the lead in formally thanking and honoring Ramsey. Ramsey, to his credit, has promised to give any reward money to the three kidnapping victims. But that only means that McDonald’s would be better off donating directly, and quietly, to any funds set up for that purpose, and stepping back. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook. My Forbes blog page is here.","response":"McDonald's is attempting to get in touch with Charles Ramsey, the man who rescued three kidnapped women in Cleveland, due to an outpouring of social media requests asking the fast-food chain to honor or reward him.

You pass a group of people. The people are talking to each other. You cannot hear what they are saying. But suddenly they start laughing. What would you think? Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before.

Over the past 12 months, prices dropped the most in nearly six decades as the recession and lower energy costs kept a lid on inflation. The Commerce Department says consumer prices showed no changed in July, in line with analysts' expectations and far below the 0.7 percent jump in June. Prices fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest annual decline since a similar drop in the period ending in January 1950. Most of the past year's decline reflects energy prices falling 28.1 percent since peaking in July 2008. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. WASHINGTON (AP) — Retail sales dropped in July, government data showed, reinforcing concerns among economists that consumers won't spend enough to help a recovery take hold. But Friday is expected to bring better news: July inflation is expected to have remained flat, and industrial production is likely to have grown for the first time in nine months. Thursday's retail sales report served as a reality check for an economy that lately has appeared poised to emerge from recession and grow again. Consumer spending powers about 70 percent of economic activity. The Cash for Clunkers rebate program helped give auto sales their biggest jump in six months in July, but sales sank elsewhere. Gas stations, department stores, electronics outlets and furniture stores all suffered. Overall, sales fell 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, after two months of modest gains. Economists had expected a 0.7 percent increase. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.6 percent, also much worse than predicted. Unemployment, flat wages, tighter credit, fear of layoffs and the urge to save more have caused many consumers to spend less. Shrinking home equity and stock portfolios have compounded the problem. As a result, \\"households are in no position to drive a decent economic recovery,\\" Paul Dales, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had managed to post robust sales during the recession, reported an unexpected drop in quarterly earnings. The company faulted lower prices for groceries and other products. But it warned that the economy continues to force customers to scale back their purchases. Still, low prices should provide some comfort for consumers. The worst recession since World War II has kept prices in check, as workers can't demand higher pay due to the scarcity of jobs. Companies have been unable to boost prices because of weak demand. Over the 12 months ending in June, consumer prices fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline in almost six decades. That trend is expected to continue when the Labor Department reports the consumer price index figures for July on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The latest figures came just a day after the Federal Reserve said the economy appeared to be \\"leveling out.\\" The Fed, signaling the recession appears to be ending, said it would hold interest rates at their current record lows. The success of Cash for Clunkers is also expected to push industrial production up 0.3 percent in July. If the forecast is correct, the increase would come after industrial production fell in 17 of the previous 18 months. The report is slated to be released Friday at 9:15 a.m. EDT. But some analysts say people buying cars under Cash for Clunkers might be holding that money back from other sectors of the economy where they might otherwise spend it. Some of Europe's largest economies also benefited from government programs to support the auto industry. Germany and France returned to economic growth in the second quarter, raising hopes the recession will end throughout Europe sooner than thought. In the United States, weak retail sales were widespread in July. One gauge that excludes autos, gas and building materials fell slightly, the fifth straight month of declines. Department store sales fell 1.6 percent last month. And the broader category of general merchandise stores, which includes big chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., dropped 0.8 percent. Gas station sales plunged 2.1 percent in July — more because of falling prices at the pump than shrinking demand. On Wall Street, stocks rose modestly. The Dow Jones industrials finished up about 37 points at just above 9,398 — their highest close since the market lows of early March. Employers cut the fewest number of jobs in July in nearly a year, and the unemployment rate fell for the first time in 15 months. But jobs remain scarce. More than 6.2 million Americans are receiving jobless benefits, the government said Thursday — 140,000 fewer than the previous week. Counting people taking advantage of an unemployment benefits program enacted by Congress, 9.25 million people received unemployment compensation in the week that ended July 25, down about 100,000 from the week before, as new claims rose but some recipients ran out of benefits and fell off the rolls, economists said. The nonprofit National Employment Law Project has calculated that 540,000 people will exhaust their emergency benefits without finding work by the end of September. And by the end of the year, it predicts 1.5 million will run out. That prospect has some in Congress calling for a further extension of benefits. Obama administration officials have said they would support an extension. AP Business Writers Martin Crutsinger and Alan Zibel in Washington, and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report. Summary:","response":"Consumer prices in the US were flat in July due to lower energy costs and the recession holding back inflation. Over the past 12 months, prices dropped by 2.1%, reflecting the largest annual decline since January 1950. Weak retail sales in July raised concerns about the pace of economic recovery, and despite the success of the \\"Cash for Clunkers\\" program benefiting auto sales, sales in other sectors such as gas stations, department stores, and electronics experienced a decline."},{"question":"Sentence: \\"Ellen talked Helen.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","response":"Imagine you have two friends, Ellen and Helen.

There are many kinds of classes available to expecting fathers and parents.","response":"These courses typically focus on understanding the process of labor, learning how to provide physical and emotional support, and becoming familiar with common medical interventions during childbirth. By investing time in attending these classes, you will not only develop a deeper understanding of the journey your wife is going through, but you will also build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will prove invaluable when the big day arrives. Another essential aspect of supporting your wife through labor is maintaining clear and open communication. For instance, discussing her birth plan and preferences will be helpful to ensure that you can advocate for her needs when she might be unable to express them herself. Additionally, understanding her expectations regarding your role in the process will strengthen your partnership and create a shared experience that promotes unity and trust. During labor, you can help your wife by engaging in practical support measures, such as assisting her with various comfort measures like massages, breathing exercises, and position changes. Encourage her to stay hydrated and nourished throughout the labor process, and provide emotional reassurance to create a calm and supportive environment for her. Furthermore, it is beneficial to familiarize yourself with the birth environment. Knowing where to find crucial facilities, including extra pillows, blankets, towels, and ice chips, can be instrumental in helping your wife stay comfortable. Also, ensure that you have packed appropriate personal items, such as comfortable clothes, snacks, toiletries, and any items your wife might find particularly soothing. Lastly, being an advocate for your wife during labor involves making informed decisions together in the event of any unforeseen circumstances or medical interventions. Be prepared to ask necessary questions, relay relevant information, and support her choices. Ultimately, your role in helping your wife through labor is multifaceted, encompassing education, communication, practical support, and advocacy. By taking these aspects seriously and preparing yourself, you can ensure that you are the steadfast support she needs during this life-changing experience, fostering a deep bond with your partner and creating a solid foundation upon which your new family can begin to grow."},{"question":"The Corbett administration said its lawsuit seeking to halt same-sex marriage licenses in Montgomery County \\"would have no direct effect\\" on the couples who have already received them. In a brief Wednesday, state attorneys said those marriage licenses were never valid, and compared gay and lesbian couples to \\"12-year-olds\\" who are also barred from marrying under state law. The state Department of Health and Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes will appear in Commonwealth Court next Wednesday to argue the case. A 1996 law defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Hanes and his supporters argue that the law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. Since July 24, Hanes has issued 154 marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Thirty-two of the couples have petitioned to intervene in the case, arguing that a ruling against Hanes could also invalidate their marriages. The state filed a brief Wednesday opposing the couples' participation, arguing that their marriage licenses hold no \\"actual value or legitimacy\\" and thus have no right to be defended in court. \\"Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old . . . is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?\\" the state wrote.

Tom Corbett's attorneys said Wednesday. Corbett's administration has filed a lawsuit seeking to block same-sex marriage licenses in suburban Philadelphia, where Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes has issued more than 150 to gay and lesbian couples since July 24. State attorneys said in a court filing on Wednesday the gay marriage licenses have no \\"value or legitimacy'' and can't be defended in court. They compared gay and lesbian couples to children, who can't marry because a 1996 law says marriage is between a man and a woman. \\"Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old ... is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?'' the state wrote in a case brief. The state Department of Health brought the case against Hanes. Hanes, who says the state law is unconstitutional and discriminatory, is scheduled to appear in Commonwealth Court next week in the case. More than 30 gay and lesbian couples that received marriage licenses from Hanes say a ruling against him could invalidate their marriages, and they've sought to participate in the case. The state opposes their participation and their efforts to defend what it calls their \\"purported marriage licenses.'' It said the gay and lesbian couples should file their own lawsuits or wait to see what happens with a federal challenge to the state's marriage law. \\"This case is about one thing: whether a local official may willfully disregard a statute based on his personal legal opinion that the statute is unconstitutional,'' the state's lawyers wrote. The Commonwealth Court last week laid out the topics to be argued at the Sept. 4 hearing on the marriage licenses issued by Hanes. It wants lawyers to focus on whether the court has jurisdiction, given that Hanes is a judicial officer. Other questions are whether issuing marriage licenses is a judicial act and whether the constitutionality of the state's marriage law can be raised as a defense. Also at issue are whether the Department of Health has standing to sue, and, if not, the effect of Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Kane's delegation of defense of the law to the governor's legal staff.

The state attorneys compared same-sex couples to 12-year-olds, highlighting that both were prevented from marrying under state law. Yet, 32 of the same-sex couples who had received the licenses petitioned to intervene in the lawsuit, arguing that their marriages could be invalidated if the ruling went against D. Bruce Hanes, the county official who had been issuing the licenses.

Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term.

According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love.

A:","response":"B: Yes; The given statement, \\"Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.\\" would indeed be a reasonable answer to the question \\"How does weather happen?\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, weather is the result of various atmospheric processes at work that determine the day-to-day conditions we experience, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and wind. These processes happen due to several factors: 1. Earth's rotation: The Earth rotates on its axis, causing the Coriolis effect – an apparent force on the winds and ocean currents due to Earth's rotation. This effect causes winds and ocean currents to rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, influencing local weather conditions. 2. Solar radiation: The sun warms the Earth's surface unevenly, causing temperature differences and variations in air pressure. As a result, air masses with different temperatures and pressures interact. This leads to convection currents in the atmosphere and results in the development of different weather systems, such as high and low-pressure systems, fronts, and cyclones. 3. Uneven heating of Earth's surface: The Earth's tilt, varying surface features (such as land and water), and different elevations cause uneven heating of the Earth's surface. These temperature differences produce pressure differences that in turn create wind, as air moves from high to low pressure, thus influencing weather patterns. 4. Water cycle: The continuous movement of water between Earth's surface and the atmosphere (through evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff) forms the water cycle. This has a significant impact on the development of different weather systems and the distribution of precipitation. 5. Topography: Mountains, valleys, and other landforms can directly influence the weather. Mountains, for example, can lead to rain shadow effect, where one side of the mountain receives more rain than the other side, creating different weather patterns. 6. Ocean currents: The movement of ocean currents helps to redistribute heat and moisture, which influences the weather over coastal regions and even further inland. Ocean currents play a significant role in determining the climate of an area. These factors interact with each other to create the various weather events we experience every day. The given statement accurately delineates the difference between weather and climate by emphasizing that weather focuses on short-term conditions, while climate characterizes long-term atmospheric trends and patterns."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

His father, Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912-2012), was an electrical engineer, and his mother, Edith Irene (nee Allen), who was from a musical family, taught him to play the piano at an early age. His great-great-great-uncle, Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet, served as Lord Mayor of London from 1866 to 1877. Gabriel attended Cable House, a private primary school in Woking; St Andrews Prep School in Horsell; and Charterhouse School in Godalming from 1963. Context: Following a five-year hiatus, Gabriel re-emerged with OVO, a soundtrack for the live Millennium Dome Show in London in 2000, and Long Walk Home, the music from the Australian movie Rabbit-Proof Fence, early in 2002. This soundtrack also received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score - Motion Picture. In September 2002, Gabriel released Up, his first full-length studio album in a decade. Entirely self-produced, Up returned to some of the themes of his work in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Only one of the three singles managed to crack the top 50--in part because almost every track exceeded six minutes in length, with multiple sections--but the album sold well globally, as Gabriel continued to draw from a loyal fan base from his almost four decades in the music business. Up was followed by a world tour featuring his daughter Melanie Gabriel on backing vocals, and two concert DVDs, Growing Up Live (2003) and Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped (2004). Gabriel contributed to the WALL-E soundtrack in 2008 with Thomas Newman, including the film's closing song, \\"Down to Earth\\", for which they received the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and a Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 2010, Gabriel released Scratch My Back. The album is composed entirely of cover songs including material written by such artists as David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor, and Neil Young. The concept for the record was that Gabriel covered songs by various artists, and those artists, in turn, covered Gabriel songs released on a follow-up album called And I'll Scratch Yours. Scratch My Back features only orchestral instrumentation; there were no guitars, drums, or electronic elements that are usual attributes of Gabriel records. A brief tour followed the album's release where Gabriel performed with a full orchestra and two female backup singers, his daughter Melanie Gabriel and Norwegian singer-songwriter Ane Brun. In October 2011, Gabriel released New Blood, a collection of his earlier songs recorded with an orchestra. A special edition of the album features solely instrumental versions of some of the songs. Gabriel embarked on the 2012 Back to Front Tour in which he performed the entire So album with a band composed of the musicians who originally played on the record, to mark its 25th anniversary. Following this tour, Gabriel took a sabbatical to spend time with his family. Early 2014 saw another Back to Front tour in Europe. In June 2016, Peter Gabriel released the single \\"I'm Amazing\\". The song was written several years prior, in part as a tribute to Muhammad Ali. As such, the single was released two weeks after Ali's death. He embarked on a joint tour with Sting titled the Rock Paper Scissors North American Tour in the same month. Question: What was OVO?.

A Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake which originated in which country?","response":"Sachertorte is a type of chocolate cake that originated in Austria, specifically in its capital city, Vienna. The cake was created in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a 16-year-old Austrian apprentice pastry chef at the court of Prince Klemens von Metternich, who was a prominent statesman and diplomat in the Austrian Empire. The prince requested a unique dessert for his distinguished guests, and it was then that the young Sacher came up with the recipe for this fabulous cake. The Sachertorte typically consists of two layers of dense and velvety chocolate sponge cake, separated by a thin layer of sweet and tangy apricot jam. The entire cake is then covered with a rich, glossy layer of dark chocolate ganache. This luscious combination gives the cake its distinctive bittersweet taste. To finish it off, it is usually garnished with a rosette of whipped cream, which is served on the side or next to the slice of cake. The original recipe for Sachertorte remains a well-guarded secret of the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, where it was first served in 1876. Eduard Sacher, Franz Sacher's son, and his wife Anna had established the hotel, and over time, the cake became an iconic symbol of Viennese cuisine. The hotel still serves the authentic Sachertorte, referred to as the \\"Original Sacher-Torte,\\" and has even trademarked the name, ensuring the consistency and quality of the cake served to its guests. Over the years, the Sachertorte has gained international renown and inspired various adaptations of the recipe, which can now be found in different countries with slight variations in flavor and presentation. However, the traditional Austrian version remains the most well-known and continues to be an essential element of the country's culinary heritage. In Austria, the Sachertorte is not only enjoyed in hotels and cafes, but it's also a popular cake to serve at home for special occasions or as a dessert during festive seasons. In fact, December 5th is recognized as National Sachertorte Day in Austria, which is a testament to the cake's importance and enduring popularity.

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... The answer to this question is:","response":"Noah, the researcher who studied the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming as compared to Frank who studied the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. This is because some parts of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, have experienced significant warming trends. As mentioned in the hint, the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006, according to a study by Eric Steig. West Antarctica, in particular, has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, with the warming being strongest in winter and spring. This warming trend is partly offset by the autumn cooling in East Antarctica. The surface warming in West Antarctica has not led to substantial melting at the surface or directly affected the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. However, it is worth noting that there have been instances of ice shelves collapsing, such as the 2002 Larsen-B ice shelf collapse and the 2008 Wilkins Ice Shelf collapse, which have raised concerns on the effects of warming in the region. Furthermore, a study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth, providing further evidence that Noah, the researcher studying the climate of Antarctica, observed a larger amount of surface warming compared to Frank. Although the effects of human carbon dioxide emissions on Antarctica's warming trend remain ambiguous, the noticeable warming trend in various parts of the continent clearly demonstrates that Noah experienced a significant amount of surface warming during his research."},{"question":"Teacher:Given a sentence in German, provide an equivalent paraphrased translation in English that retains the same meaning both through the translation and the paraphrase.

The country's economy has grown every year since 1992. By export it ranks 22nd in the world, ahead of Australia and India. Shipyards like Gdansk, home of the democracy movement, struggle to survive.","response":"Title: Poland's Economic Ascendancy, Two Decades after Embracing Democracy Introduction Twenty years after embracing democracy, Poland stands tall with the strongest economy among the nations in the former Soviet bloc. The nation has experienced consistent economic growth annually since 1992, fueled by its booming export sector that now ranks 22nd in the world, ahead of economic powerhouses like Australia and India. Although some industries, such as the shipyards in Gdansk—the cradle of Poland's democracy movement—struggle for survival, the country's overall economic performance is worth examining and appreciating. Poland's Economic Transformation The initiation of democracy in Poland brought about structural and policy reforms that have accelerated the country's economic growth. Poland underwent a process of privatization, liberalization, and dismantling of trade barriers, which opened the nation's market to global players and allowed its economy to integrate into the international business community. Furthermore, Poland has also benefited from its strategic location within Europe and a highly skilled workforce, which have significantly contributed to driving its economy forward. Growth Driven by Exports Poland's economy has been significantly propelled by the export sector, as it currently ranks 22nd globally in terms of exports. The nation has successfully leveraged its vast and varied industries in sectors such as automotive, food, defence, and consumer electronics, among others. The export-oriented growth model has not only helped Poland create new markets and boost international trade but also attracted foreign direct investments (FDIs) to the country. These factors have contributed to the nation's ability to outpace other countries, such as Australia and India, in global export rankings. Challenges: The Struggling Shipbuilding Industry Despite the remarkable achievements of Poland's economy, some sectors continue to face challenges. One of these industries is the shipbuilding sector, which has historically played a vital role in the nation's development and symbolizes the country's resilience and commitment to democracy. Shipyards like Gdansk, where the democratic movement was born in the 1980s, now struggle to survive in the face of fierce competition, outdated infrastructure, and lack of investment. Nonetheless, the Polish government has recognized the need to revive this industry and has outlined plans to modernize and restructure the shipyards in Gdansk and Szczecin to reposition them as competitive players in the global shipbuilding market. With the proper implementation of these plans, the shipbuilding industry could once again contribute significantly to Poland's economic growth and serve as a testament to the country's transformative journey over the last two decades. Conclusion Poland has come a long way from its days as a Soviet satellite state, to now boasting a strong and diversified economy that continues to grow year after year. The country's success can be largely attributed to its solid economic foundation, characterized by structural reforms, trade liberalization, and export-driven growth model. Poland's economic rise is not only an inspiring success story but also serves as an example for other transitioning economies to follow and adopt. While challenges such as the struggling shipbuilding industry persist, Poland's ongoing commitment to innovation, modernization, and development is what will ultimately steer its economy toward even greater heights."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"Aromi pub, located in the riverside area, is child-friendly and has a 3 out of 5 customer rating.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","response":"Concept 1: Aromi Pub - Triple 1: (Aromi Pub, type, pub) - Triple 2: (Aromi Pub, location, riverside area) - Triple 3: (Aromi Pub, customer rating, 3 out of 5) Concept 2: Child-Friendliness - Triple 4: (Aromi Pub, child-friendly, True) - Triple 5: (Aromi Pub, attracts, family customers) - Triple 6: (Aromi Pub, offers, child-friendly environment) Concept 3: Riverside Area - Triple 7: (riverside area, type, geographic area) - Triple 8: (riverside area, feature, proximity to river) - Triple 9: (riverside area, attracts, businesses and customers) Concept 4: Customer Rating - Triple 10: (customer rating, evaluates, quality of service) - Triple 11: (customer rating, based on, customer reviews) - Triple 12: (customer rating, scale, 1 to 5)"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - One type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air - Some scientists believe that releasing too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is one of the causes of global warming - This upsets the balance of the carbon cycle - The ozone layer helps protect us from harmful rays from the sun - It is getting damaged from air pollution such as methane gas from livestock and CFCs from spray cans - Acid rain is created when gasses such as sulfur dioxide get high into the atmosphere - The wind can blow these gasses for miles and then they get washed out of the air when it rains - This rain is called acid rain and can damage forests and kill fish. Question: suppose cutting down more trees happens, how will it affect global warming increases. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"A: More Cutting down more trees will have a significant impact on increasing global warming. This can be explained through several factors that contribute to this detrimental effect on the environment. 1. Carbon sequestration: Trees play a crucial role in the carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They act as natural \\"carbon sinks,\\" storing this carbon in various plant tissues, such as leaves, branches, and roots, and in the surrounding soil. When trees are cut down, this carbon-absorption capacity is lost. Moreover, if the trees are burned or left to decay, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, further contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. 2. Reduced cooling effect: Forests impact local and regional temperatures through the process of evapotranspiration, where water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration by plants. This process helps maintain the balance of temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, which in turn helps to regulate the earth's climate. When trees are removed, this cooling effect is diminished, leading to a rise in local temperatures that can contribute to the overall increase in global warming. 3. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services: Forests are home to a diverse range of species and provide essential ecosystem services, such as water purification, pollination, and soil stabilization. Deforestation can lead to habitat loss and the extinction of species, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and making them less resilient to climate change. This can have cascading effects on the environment, affecting the planet's ability to adapt to changing conditions and increasing global warming. 4. Change in albedo: Albedo refers to the proportion of incoming solar radiation that is reflected by a surface back into space. Light-colored surfaces like snow, ice, and some tree canopies have a high albedo and help to reflect sunlight, keeping the earth cool. Dark surfaces, such as deforested lands and urban areas, absorb more sunlight, leading to an increase in surface temperatures. When trees are cut down and replaced with darker surfaces, the earth's surface absorbs more sunlight, contributing to global warming. In conclusion, cutting down more trees will lead to an increase in global warming due to the loss of carbon sequestration capacity, reduced cooling effect through evapotranspiration, disruption of ecosystems and their services, and changes in the earth's albedo. It is essential to promote responsible and sustainable forestry practices, as well as the preservation and restoration of existing forests, in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and maintain a healthy and balanced environment."},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Options: - afternoon - dusk - daytime - night - dawn The answer is \\"dawn\\" because A:","response":"The answer is \\"dawn\\" because the term \\"party animals\\" typically refers to people who enjoy partying for extended periods of time, often late into the night or early morning hours. In this specific case, the party animals began drinking in the evening, which is typically around the time when night starts to fall. For the celebration to continue beyond the nighttime hours, the event would presumably have to reach into the early morning, when dawn is just beginning to break. Dawn is the period of time just before sunrise, marking the transition from darkness to daylight. It is often associated with the first light of day and signifies the beginning of the new day. Consequently, by saying that the party animals were not done until dawn, you imply that the festivities continued throughout the whole night, only coming to a conclusion when the morning light started to appear. To further support this conclusion, let's evaluate the other given options: 1. Afternoon: This option is not valid because the celebrations started in the evening, and moving back to the afternoon would mean that the party ended before it even began, which is not possible. 2. Dusk: Dusk refers to the period of time just after sunset, marking the transition from daylight to darkness. Since the party started in the evening, claiming that it ended at dusk would suggest that the party lasted for a very short period, which wouldn't adequately characterize the behavior of party animals. 3. Daytime: Daytime refers to the broad time frame spanning from morning to evening, which includes the daylight hours. If the revelers were truly party animals, the celebrations would not have concluded during the day, as their preferred time for fun extends throughout the night till the early morning hours. 4. Night: Party animals are known for their vigorous nightlife, so to end the party during the night would be counterintuitive. Ending the party at night would also not capture the intensity of partying that they are known for. Based on the given context and the inherent nature of party animals, the most fitting answer among the options provided is \\"dawn.\\" This is because party animals are recognized for their ability to sustain long periods of festivities, often making their gatherings last until the early morning light signals a new day."},{"question":"Test sentence: \\"Ida hunted deer in the woods.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?

He was the key figure in the creation of the AFL-CIO and served as the AFL-CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979. Meany, the son of a union plumber, became a plumber at a young age, as well. He became a full-time union official 12 years later. Meany was born into a Roman Catholic family in Harlem, New York City on August 16, 1894, the second of 10 children. His parents were Michael Meany and Anne Cullen Meany, who were both American-born and of Irish descent. His ancestors had immigrated to the United States in the 1850s. His father was a plumber and a strong supporter of the trade union movement and served as president of his plumber's union local. Michael Meany was also a precinct level activist in the Democratic Party. Meany grew up in the Port Morris neighborhood of The Bronx, where his parents had moved when he was five years old. Always called \\"George,\\" he learned that his real first name was William only when he got a work permit as a teenager. Following his father's career path, Meany quit high school at 16 to work as a plumber's helper.

Santiago was born in Manila, Philippines, on June 10, 1965, the third of six sons of an anesthesiologist. In 1972, when President Marcos declared martial law, the family immigrated to the United States. After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground's \\"Rock and Roll\\".As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program \\"Iggy\\" and his second \\"Pop\\" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money.After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics. He met Charles Thompson, an anthropology student and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars. Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing \\"non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock\\" with Thompson.Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: \\"Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm.

Model Abigail Ratchford posted multiple videos on her official website that show her in a revealing bathing suit standing in front of a table filled with In-N-Out burgers. The videos show her throwing fries at the camera and messily drinking a milkshake. The burger chain has since sent a letter to the company that produced the videos, LiveRich Media, complaining about her “various sexually suggestive acts with In-N-Out Burger food,” and requesting that she take down the videos immediately, TMZ reports.

First, carefully take the cake pan out of the oven using oven mitts to protect your hands from the heat.

Options: - car crash - splinter - automobile accidents - smoke - backache Explain why a human would choose \\"backache\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"backache\\" as an answer to the question above because it directly relates to the physical discomfort experienced by the driver, which could lead to unwillingness or difficulty in driving a car. Out of the provided options, a backache is the most appropriate factor to influence a driver's desire to avoid driving a car. Let us analyze each option in detail to understand this choice better: 1. Car crash - While a car crash could certainly create circumstances in which an individual might want to refrain from driving, the event itself does not inherently cause the driver discomfort or difficulty while driving. After the accident, the driver might be traumatized or hesitant to drive, but this option does not explicitly mention the ongoing state of the driver and whether they are still affected by the crash. 2. Splinter - Though a splinter might cause a minor discomfort, humans are generally capable of managing the inconvenience of a small splinter while driving a car. It would require a highly sensitive area or an extremely painful splinter to cause them to avoid driving altogether. This option seems less compelling as compared to a backache, which has a more direct connection to the driver's physical ability to operate a vehicle. 3. Automobile accidents - This option is similar to the first one, mentioning car crashes. It merely states an external event that might instigate fear or hesitation for the driver, but it does not specifically discuss the driver's condition or state. Automobile accidents may cause temporary reluctance, but this option does not imply that they are the direct cause of the driver's discomfort. 4. Smoke - Although smoke could certainly make driving uncomfortable or even dangerous, it is an external factor present in the environment rather than an issue pertaining to the driver's physical state. Smoke may temporarily prevent a driver from operating a vehicle, but it is not something that the driver inherently possesses or suffers from, and hence would not be the most appropriate answer here. 5. Backache - The discomfort or pain caused by a backache can make driving difficult and potentially even hazardous, as the driver may struggle to maintain good posture and proper control of the vehicle. The pain associated with a backache might also reduce concentration levels and cause fatigue, further impacting the driver's abilities. Since backaches manifest in the driver's body, it is a factor that a human would directly associate with the driver, making it the most logical choice among the options provided. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"backache\\" as the answer because it implies a direct impact on the driver's physical well-being, concentration, and ability to operate a vehicle efficiently. The other options either focus on external factors or are less likely to cause significant discomfort or unwillingness to drive. The presence of a backache has the most plausible potential to affect the driver negatively and make them unwilling to drive a car."},{"question":"Maisie Williams Is Pumped for Season 7 : People.com 08/23/2016 AT 04:25 PM EDT ' season 7 is going to be a long one, and ' tweets aren't making it any easier.

Thats right, wires that carry electric current. These wires carry electric current to your home. But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.

Options: - dies - being imprisoned - blood - bloody mess - feeling of guilt Explain why a human would choose \\"being imprisoned\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human might choose \\"being imprisoned\\" as an answer to the question about the negative external consequence for someone who takes part in a killing because it represents a punishment or repercussion enforced by society and the legal system. In many societies, killing is considered a crime and is morally and legally unacceptable. When someone takes part in a killing, they may be charged with a crime such as murder or manslaughter. If found guilty, they could face imprisonment as a consequence. The options provided in the question denote different aspects related to a killing, but the option \\"being imprisoned\\" is the most suitable answer related to negative external consequences, as the other options are not consequences per se. Here's a brief analysis of the other options: - Dies: This could happen during the act or as a consequence of the crime, but it's not an external consequence as it directly affects the person involved, rather than being a result of society's reaction. - Blood and bloody mess: These options are associated with the act of killing and the physical aftermath but are not external consequences imposed by society or the legal system. - Feeling of guilt: While this may be a negative consequence for someone who takes part in a killing, it is an internal, emotional response and not an external consequence enforced by society or the law. In summary, a human would choose \\"being imprisoned\\" to answer the question because it accurately represents the negative external consequence that arises from societal and legal norms and repercussions related to participating in a killing. This punishment is imposed by the legal system and serves as a means to hold the person accountable for their actions, restore justice, and protect the public from potential harm."},{"question":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

Con Conquest of Mexico .\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" true?","response":"Based on the given premise, \\"Con Conquest of Mexico,\\" it is not entirely clear what specific events or time period the statement is referring to. However, if we assume that this premise is referring to the historical series of events associated with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which was a significant part of the larger Spanish colonization of the Americas, we can analyze the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, led by Hernán Cortés, began in 1519 and ended in 1521. The Aztec Empire, centered in Mexico and led by Moctezuma II at the time, was a highly advanced and complex civilization. Following initial meetings and diplomacy between the Spanish and the Aztecs, the relationships between the two groups quickly deteriorated. The conquest was characterized by significant battles, political maneuvering, and eventual subjugation of the Aztec Empire. The timeline for the conquest of Mexico can be seen as quite short, as it lasted only two years from 1519 to 1521. However, considering the complexity of the Aztec Empire and the extent of the Spanish colonization efforts in the Americas, one could argue that the complete subjugation of indigenous populations and the establishment of stable Spanish rule took much longer than the initial conquest. Following the fall of the Aztec Empire, there were numerous uprisings, confrontations, and tensions between the Spanish colonizers and the indigenous populations. The process of \\"pacification\\" conducted by the Spanish authorities, which aimed to suppress indigenous resistance, took many years to complete. The Spanish colonizers employed a variety of tactics, including forced labor systems and the spread of European diseases, which significantly contributed to the decline of the indigenous population. Furthermore, the integration of the remaining indigenous peoples into the newly formed colonial society took several generations, as many aspects of indigenous culture and religion were forcibly suppressed and replaced with Spanish culture and Catholicism. The lasting impacts of the Spanish conquest of Mexico can still be observed today in the cultural, demographic, and linguistic features of modern Mexican society. In conclusion, while the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which can be considered a significant aspect of the conquest of Mexico, took only two years, the process of subjugating, assimilating, and controlling the indigenous populations and territories took much longer, lasting several generations. Taking this broader perspective into consideration, the hypothesis \\"The conquest of Mexico lasted a long time.\\" can be regarded as true. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based on the assumption that the premise \\"Con Conquest of Mexico\\" refers to the historical events associated with the Spanish colonization of the Aztec Empire and its surrounding territories."},{"question":"How does the next paragraph end?

All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources..., can you guess it ?

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Canadian Idol was a Canadian reality television competition show which aired on CTV, based on the British show \\"Pop Idol\\". The show was a competition to find the most talented young singer in Canada, and was hosted by Ben Mulroney. Jon Dore was the \\"roving reporter\\" for the first three seasons (appearing in comedy skits throughout the show). Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Tyler Hamilton is a pop singer best known for placing seventh in the first season of Canadian Idol . He is also a member of the classical music group \`\` Due Voci . '' The group has recently released their first studio album in June 2010 . - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.

The plan, which seeks to charge a fee for each e-mail sent, has been met with widespread disapproval from both individuals and organizations alike. The opposition is notable for its diversity, encompassing people with different political affiliations, social backgrounds, and professions. Among the opponents are not only average internet users who stand to be affected by the proposed fee plan, but also numerous businesses and advocacy groups that rely on e-mail as a primary means of communication. One reason for such a broad opposition is the concern that the fee plan would create a tiered system, segregating those who can afford the fees from those who cannot, effectively creating inequalities within the digital realm. This, critics argue, would have a far-reaching impact on digital communication, inhibiting access to vital information and services for those on the lower end of the economic scale. Furthermore, the plan raises concerns about the future of e-mail as a democratic platform. Currently, e-mail serves as an essential tool for communication, enabling people from all walks of life to easily exchange ideas, opinions, and information. By introducing a fee per e-mail sent, AOL would significantly alter the nature of e-mail communication, restricting its availability based on financial capability. This could potentially suppress the flow of ideas and counteract the democratizing effect the internet has had in recent decades. Business environments would also be affected by the implementation of such a plan. With e-mail being a primary means of communication in many industries, the fee plan could potentially increase overall operating costs, forcing businesses to reconsider their communication strategies and perhaps turn to alternative channels. This could have a trickle-down effect, impacting employees and stakeholders alike. As the opposition to AOL's proposed e-mail fee plan continues to grow, it remains unclear whether the company will proceed with its plans or reconsider its approach. Regardless of the outcome, the widespread concern and diverse range of groups speaking out against the proposal underscore the importance of equal access to digital communication in our modern society."},{"question":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .

Article:","response":"Title: Woman Accused of Murdering Newborn Son in Gold Coast Home Hey kids, today we have a very sad story to tell you. It's about a mommy who did something very bad to her little baby boy. This kind of news might be a little scary, but it's important for us to learn about it. A woman named Jodie Tarnawsky, who is 35 years old, is being accused of doing something terrible to her newborn son on June 8. This happened at their home in a place called Gold Coast. Now, after the baby boy was no longer alive, Jodie didn't tell anyone for 17 hours. That's a very long time! After this time passed, she finally called an ambulance to come help. An ambulance is a special type of car that takes people who are very sick or hurt to the hospital. When the ambulance workers, called paramedics, got to Jodie's home, they found the poor little baby boy. He was wrapped in a towel and placed on top of a washing machine. A washing machine is where we put our dirty clothes to get them all clean again. Because what Jodie did is very serious and can harm others, some important people who make decisions about whether someone can go home or not while they figure out if they did something wrong (called bail) said that she can't leave. This all happened at a place called the Brisbane Supreme Court. This is a very sad story, and we must always remember that it's important to take care of and protect little babies and anyone who is not able to take care of themselves. Sometimes, bad things happen, but we should always try to do our best to be kind and caring towards others."},{"question":"Question: Facts: - death date: 10 july 1819 - field: medallist - birth date: 3 november 1730 - name: pierre-simon-benjamin duvivier - nationality: french - death place: paris , france - birth place: paris , france Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of pierre-simon-benjamin duvivier .

The fight at Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, Okla., began Saturday afternoon and lasted for approximately two minutes, according to a statement from Corrections Corp. of America, which operates the facility and is the country’s largest private prison company. It then took prison... ||||| Four inmates died of injuries sustained during an attack or fight over the weekend at an Oklahoma prison, officials said, and investigators are trying to determine what sparked the violence. File-This March 22, 2005, file photo shows men wait outside the Cimarron Correctional Facility, in Cushing, Okla. Three inmates are dead and five injured after a disturbance at an Oklahoma prison, a spokesman... (Associated Press) The incident that also left four inmates injured happened around 4 p.m. Saturday at the Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, a community between the state's two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The prison houses medium- and maximum-security male inmates. Three inmates were declared dead on Saturday and the fourth died overnight at a hospital. Terri Watkins, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said Sunday that preliminary reports show the first three men who died were fatally stabbed. But Watkins said she didn't know the nature of the injuries to any of the other inmates. The stabbings apparently happened in quick succession while the inmates at a medium-security wing of the prison were being let out of their cells into the exercise yard, Watkins said. \\"The entire stabbing incident happened over a couple of minutes,\\" Watkins said, adding that prisoners were all locked in their cells within 40 minutes of the outbreak of violence. No prison staff were injured or involved in the attack, Watkins said. None of the prisoners' names were released because their families had to be notified first, she said. One of the treated inmates was later returned to the prison and the other three remained hospitalized in stable condition Sunday, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates the prison. Owen said the inmate attacks lasted less than two minutes. He didn't immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking further details. It is the second major violent outburst in months at the prison. In June, some 200 to 300 of the prison's roughly 1,600 inmates were involved in a brawl there. Eleven prisoners were taken to hospitals after the fight and the facility was placed on lockdown. The fighting occurred among inmates in three separate housing units. Watkins said that as a precaution, all Oklahoma prisons have been placed on lockdown, which means that inmates are confined to their cells and their movement inside the facility is severely restricted. She said two separate investigations are underway — one by the Department of Corrections' inspector general's office and the other by CCA. Oklahoma has the highest rate of prison homicides in the nation, with state inmates killed at a rate more than three times the national average, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The figures reviewed by The Associated Press as part of a months-long investigation earlier this year show that there were 39 homicides at Oklahoma prisons between 2001 and 2012, a rate of 14 per 100,000 inmates. The national average is 4 per 100,000. ___ Follow Sean Murphy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apseanmurphy ||||| A \\"disturbance\\" at an Oklahoma prison Saturday afternoon left four inmates dead and several more hospitalized, officials said Sunday.

But it took prison staff another 38 minutes to secure the single housing area where the killings took place, officials said. The facility, which is operated by the Corrections Corporation of America, houses 1,720 medium- and maximum-security male inmates. The prison was on lock down Sunday while officials investigated, a release said, and three inmates remained in local hospitals in stable condition.

The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - George Francis McGinnins ( March 19 , 1826 -- May 29 , 1910 ) was a volunteer soldier during the Mexican - American War and a Union General during the American Civil War . - The Confederate States, officially the Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized breakaway country of 11 secessionist slave states existing from 1861 to 1865. It was originally formed by seven slave states South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon the labor of African-American slaves. - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer. - A non-commissioned officer or noncommissioned officer (NCO, colloquially non-com or noncom) is a military officer who has not earned a commission. Such is also called sub-officer in some countries. Non-commissioned officers, in the English-speaking world, usually obtain their position of authority by promotion through the enlisted ranks. In contrast, commissioned officers hold higher ranks than NCOs, have more legal responsibilities, are paid more, and often have more non-military training such as a university diploma. Commissioned officers usually earn their commissions without having risen through the enlisted ranks. \\"Mustang\\" is a slang term in the United States Armed Forces used to refer to a commissioned officer who began his or her career as an enlisted service member. - Secession (derived from the Latin term \\"secessio\\") is the withdrawal of a group from a larger entity, especially a political entity (a country), but also any organization, union or military alliance. Threats of secession can also be a strategy for achieving more limited goals. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? Options: A: He mixed it with several oils instead of water. B: He put some beer into the mixture. C: He added more coffee into the mixture than before. D: He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils.

It implies that the Ozarks contain soluble rocks like limestone. The Colorado Rockies, on the other hand, are known to be more massive and younger but do not have any mention of caves systems or limestone formations.

When I was a little girl, I never dared to ask strangers the way. And so I used to walk around in circles and hope that by chance I would get to the place I was going to. Now, I am no longer too shy to ask people for directions, but I often receive helpless or even wrong information. So I try to avoid giving people wrong directions.

They found out Hill county had experienced that, while New county hadn't. Which county experienced less air pollution? Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. The answer to this question is:","response":"New County experienced less air pollution. Since Hill County had experienced acid rain and New County had not, this indicates that there was a higher level of air pollution in Hill County. Air pollution, specifically sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, contributes to the formation of acid rain, which has an acidic pH and can be destructive to wildlife and the environment. Therefore, the absence of acid rain in New County suggests that it had lower levels of air pollution compared to Hill County."},{"question":"bread for 5 minutes at 200 ° c Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","response":"Bread for 5 minutes at 200°C Step-by-step: 1.

Lewis's successes continued beyond the controversy, and he enjoyed a career revival in the late 1960s and 1970s, particularly in the country music genre.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.

Step 2: Identify similarities between the premise and the hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis involve people dressed in blue and vacuuming a carpet. Step 3: Identify differences between the premise and the hypothesis The key difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the context in which the vacuuming is taking place. The hypothesis introduces the context of a hotel, which is not mentioned in the premise. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise Entailment means that one statement necessarily follows from another. In this case, the hypothesis introduces information (the hotel context) that is not present in the premise.

While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator. Sabian, who has been trying rather unsuccessfully to negotiate peace between his sulking wife (Keller) and cheeky daughter (Mulrooney), arrives on the scene. Roman and Sabian have only met once...

Tay, the company's online chat bot designed to talk like a teen, started spewing racist and hateful comments on Twitter on Wednesday, and Microsoft (MSFT) shut Tay down around midnight. The company has already deleted most of the offensive tweets, but not before people took screenshots. Here's a sampling of the things she said: \\"N------ like @deray should be hung! #BlackLivesMatter\\" \\"I f------ hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell.\\" \\"Hitler was right I hate the jews.\\" \\"chill im a nice person! i just hate everybody\\" Microsoft blames Tay's behavior on online trolls, saying in a statement that there was a \\"coordinated effort\\" to trick the program's \\"commenting skills.\\" \\"As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments,\\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said. \\"[Tay] is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical.\\" Tay is essentially one central program that anyone can chat with using Twitter, Kik or GroupMe. As people chat with it online, Tay picks up new language and learns to interact with people in new ways. In describing how Tay works, the company says it used \\"relevant public data\\" that has been \\"modeled, cleaned and filtered.\\" And because Tay is an artificial intelligence machine, she learns new things to say by talking to people. \\"The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you,\\" Microsoft explains. Tay is still responding to direct messages. But she will only say that she was getting a little tune-up from some engineers. In her last tweet, Tay said she needed sleep and hinted that she would be back. c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016 -- CNNMoney's David Goldman contributed to this report. ||||| It took 15 hours for Twitter to teach an artificially intelligent chatbot to be a racist, sexist monster. If you're shocked, you probably don't spend much time on Twitter. Microsoft's programmers presumably do, though, and the shocking thing is that they didn't see this coming. Microsoft created a chatbot named Tay that was designed to talk like a millennial and learn more authentic conversation by interacting with humans online. Tay was dubbed by her creators as an \\"AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!\\" (Oh boy.) Some of Tay's interactions might actually pass a millennial Turing test. She even uses emoji! Unfortunately, millennials are also just about as racist and possibly even more sexist than their parents. It didn't take long before Tay was imitating those qualities too, and a cute 19-year-old girl transformed into a Gamergate-loving Hitler youth. Twitter trolls started teaching Tay some horrible racial slurs and genocidal ideation. The latter tweet, Business Insider notes, appears to be the result of a user asking Tay to repeat a phrase verbatim. Some, but not all, of Tay's offensive tweets did something like this. Tay also started harassing Zoë Quinn, a game developer who once went into hiding due to the virulent misogynistic \\"Gamergate\\" threats she received online. Wow it only took them hours to ruin this bot for me. This is the problem with content-neutral algorithms pic.twitter.com/hPlINtVw0V — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Tay also started hitting on random people in direct messages. Quinn, and many other critics, pointed out that Microsoft's designers really should have anticipated these outcomes and programmed Tay with filters ahead of time. It's 2016. If you're not asking yourself \\"how could this be used to hurt someone\\" in your design/engineering process, you've failed. — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Microsoft has deleted most of the offensive tweets, and told Business Insider that it's now making \\"adjustments\\" to the bot. Microsoft's website for Tay featured this banner on Thursday morning: Twitter itself has also come under heavy criticism for not doing enough to address harassment, especially of high-profile users who are women and people of color. Some leave the platform because the problem is so bad. Twitter has made some changes, but many users still charge that the company isn't making harassment enough of a priority. This may be partly because its staff isn't very diverse, and the problem may feel less urgent to white men whose lives aren't severely impacted by racialized, sexual harassment. The same general problem may be at work here. The possibility of harassment is going to be more top of mind for women and people of color who experience it frequently, but they're also less likely to be well-represented on tech teams. Microsoft is no exception. Or maybe Microsoft just somehow failed to take basic precautions that should be standard in the industry. @WyoWeeds @bradplumer But bot-building community has already put a lot of thought into avoiding this problem. Which MS ignored. cc @norareed — John Fleck (@jfleck) March 24, 2016 Microsoft said it created Tay to \\"experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding.\\" The engineers probably came away with a different understanding of conversation than they bargained for. ||||| Microsoft has been forced to dunk Tay, its millennial-mimicking chatbot, into a vat of molten steel. The company has terminated her after the bot started tweeting abuse at people and went full neo-Nazi, declaring that \\"Hitler was right I hate the jews.\\" @TheBigBrebowski ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 23, 2016 Some of this appears to be \\"innocent\\" insofar as Tay is not generating these responses. Rather, if you tell her \\"repeat after me\\" she will parrot back whatever you say, allowing you to put words into her mouth. However, some of the responses were organic. The Guardian quotes one where, after being asked \\"is Ricky Gervais an atheist?\\", Tay responded, \\"ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism.\\" \\"Tay\\" went from \\"humans are super cool\\" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — Gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016 In addition to turning the bot off, Microsoft has deleted many of the offending tweets. But this isn't an action to be taken lightly; Redmond would do well to remember that it was humans attempting to pull the plug on Skynet that proved to be the last straw, prompting the system to attack Russia in order to eliminate its enemies.

Emojis (🌍, 🇬🇷, ✈️, 🏛️, 🏖️): These small digital images help convey the user's emotions and complement the content of the tweet. 2. Hashtags (#Travel, #Greece, #BucketList): By using hashtags, the user categorizes their tweet, making it easier for others interested in the same topics to find and interact with the message. 3.

In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt until thoroughly combined. In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together 1/2 cup (1 stick) of unsalted, softened butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes on medium-high speed. Add 2 large room-temperature eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition to ensure they are fully incorporated. Add 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and mix until combined. Next, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with 1/2 cup of whole milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture to ensure a smooth batter. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cupcakes. Fold in any additional flavorings or mix-ins (such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit) if desired. Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, evenly distribute the cupcake batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each liner about 2/3 full to allow for rising during baking. Gently tap the muffin tin on the counter to release any air bubbles and ensure a consistent rise. Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Keep an eye on the cupcakes to ensure they do not overbake, as this will result in dry and crumbly cupcakes. Once the cupcakes are baked, remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire cooling rack for around 5 minutes. After this time, carefully remove the individual cupcakes from the tin and place them directly on the cooling rack to cool completely. This will prevent the cupcakes from becoming soggy as they cool. While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare your desired frosting. Popular options include buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or even a simple dusting of powdered sugar. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use a piping bag and a decorative tip to create beautiful swirls of frosting or simply spread the frosting on top with a knife or an offset spatula. Finally, add any additional decorations such as sprinkles, edible glitter, or fondant shapes if desired.

Rockefeller was the youngest of six children born to financier John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich. John Jr. was the only son of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman. In 1964, along with other American business figures such as Sol Linowitz, Rockefeller founded the non-profit International Executive Service Corps which encourages developing nations to promote private enterprise.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF) was the military aviation service of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II, successor to the United States Army Air Corps and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force. The AAF were a component of the United States Army, which in 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff. - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\". - The Enola Gay is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, named for Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets, who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb. The bomb, code-named \\"Little Boy\\", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. \\"Enola Gay\\" participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, Nagasaki, being bombed instead. - A navigator is the person on board a ship or aircraft responsible for its navigation. The navigator's primary responsibility is to be aware of ship or aircraft position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the ship's captain or aircraft commander of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship's nautical charts, nautical publications, and navigational equipment, and generally has responsibility for meteorological equipment and communications. - The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing which was flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean War. It was one of the largest aircraft operational during World War II and featured state of the art technology. It was the single most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, exceeding the cost of the Manhattan Project by between 1 and 1.7 billion dollars. Innovations introduced included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a remote, computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer.

Designed for the high-altitude strategic bomber role, the B-29 also excelled in low-altitude nighttime incendiary bombing missions. One of the B-29's final roles during World War II was carrying out the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. - \\"Little Boy\\" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress \\"Enola Gay\\", piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces. It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity test, and the first uranium-based detonation. It exploded with an energy of approximately . The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - History. Edo period. The Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans were \\"daimys\\" at Kokura Castle during the Edo period (16031868). Miyamoto Musashi, samurai swordsman, author of \\"The Book of Five Rings\\" and founder of the Hyoho Niten Ichi-ry, famous for its use of two swords, lived in the Kokura castle under the patronage of the Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans briefly during 1634. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\".

We can combine them by subtracting the coefficients: 1576*u - 1563*u = (1576-1563)*u = 13*u The equation becomes: 13*u + 52 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable u. To isolate u, we need to get rid of the constant term, 52. We do this by subtracting 52 from both sides of the equation: 13*u + 52 - 52 = 0 - 52 This simplifies to: 13*u = -52 Step 3: Solve for u. Now that we have isolated u, we can solve for its value by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient in front of u, which is 13: 13*u / 13 = -52 / 13 u = -4 And the answer is: u = -4."},{"question":"Read the bio below and try to give details on fred felber 's: - teams - position - years - pfr - databasefootball - college - death date - birth date - nfl - birth place Bio: frederick emmett felber -lrb- march 25 , 1909 -- may 1978 -rrb- was an american football offensive tackle in the national football league for the boston braves and the philadelphia eagles . he played college football at the university of north dakota .","response":"Fred Felber's details: - Teams: Boston Braves and Philadelphia Eagles - Position: Offensive Tackle - Years: Active years are not specifically mentioned, but considering his birth and death dates, it can be assumed he played during the 1930s and/or 1940s. - PFR: Unfortunately, there is no link to his Pro Football Reference page, but you can search for him on their website. - Databasefootball: No information provided or mention of his profile on Databasefootball, but you can search for him on their website. - College: University of North Dakota - Death Date: May 1978 - Birth Date: March 25, 1909 - NFL: Played in the National Football League (NFL) - Birth Place: Not mentioned in the bio."},{"question":"Is the following review positive or negative? don't often love corporate chains..but love the Yard House..great selections of drinks and food..love the variety...everyone is always pleased with their meal..from fresh salads to tacos.. :) service is always friendly and accommodating......had the wings..tasty but small, ahi tuna salad and clam chowder.

The campaign is being supported by five times Olympic gold medalist, Sir Steve Redgrave, who has reading trouble. Pupils have the right to receive text in another way, and parents can take action under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) if they feel their children are being treated in a different way through a lack of support. But new research suggests 89 per cent of print disabled pupils and their parents are unaware of software which changes standard print into other substitutes like combined text and audio files which can be read or listened to. Sir Steve has teamed up with software company Dolphin Computer Access to raise awareness of software turning tools.

I just point out what's funny in others' Michael Peña was five years into his career when his then-manager called him into her office one day. “You’re not funny, Mike,” she said. “That’s what I’m hearing.” Even from this distance, more than a decade later, the actor is prone to give a small, sad shake of the head at that story. “Maybe I really wasn’t,” he says softly. “I don’t think she was being mean.” An upwards inflection at the end of the sentence leaves the point moot. It is worth recalling the words of that manager while watching Ant-Man, an oddball addition to the Marvel movie stable. Paul Rudd plays the hero, who has access to a serum that enables him to shrink to insect-size while retaining enormous reserves of strength. But it is Peña, as his hyperactive chum Luis, full of plots and plans and snappy talk, who brings the house down. His comic timing is effortless but precise. He can make a line uproarious simply by accelerating his delivery, or modulate the laugh by leaving an extra beat before responding. When I last met Peña three years ago, he seemed reserved and defensive, with little of his on-screen warmth. End of Watch, the film he was promoting back then, had been gruelling to make, as is customary with any macho David Ayer action movie. (Peña also starred in the director’s recent tank-bound second world war drama Fury.) And it had taken a while for the actor to establish a rapport with his co-star Jake Gyllenhaal on set, to whom he referred during our interview as “that guy”, gesturing at the End of Watch poster with his thumb. Related: Ant-Man review – really, really small superhero slips between the cracks | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week Put his improved mood today down to the more escapist slant of Ant-Man, a smoother relationship with his co-star this time around or simply an upswing in his own fortunes. (He has a stack of high-profile movies in production including Ridley Scott’s The Martian and a big-screen version, à la 21 Jump Street, of the old TV cop show CHiPs.) He is 39, with a lightly padded, lazily boyish face, and a moustache-and-goatee combo in boot-polish black. He is dressed in a grey shirt, black trousers and dark blue suede shoes; he swings his legs up in front of him on the chaise longue so that he is sitting almost in profile. But look at the socks: stripy, silly, multicoloured. They’re the socks you put on when things are going your way. Of course, Ant-Man has had its share of troubles. Peña signed up for the film because he was eager to work with its director and co-writer, Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). “His films have their own way of being. Their own life. It was a no-brainer.” But Wright walked away from the project immediately prior to shooting when creative differences emerged between him and Marvel executives. “Movies go from one person to another,” says Peña with a “what-can-you-do?” shrug. “It still feels to me like an Edgar movie at its core.” The picture’s comic energy is most abundantly in evidence whenever Rudd and Peña are together on screen: the former is laconic; the latter fizzing and sparking like a human catherine wheel. “That wasn’t how the character started out,” he tells me. “He was more like me at first.” Easygoing, that is. Softly spoken. Smouldering. “But that wasn’t working. Paul and I realised it would be cool to play up the Abbott-and-Costello, Laurel-and-Hardy kinda thing. Focus on the opposites.” When I remark that their double act works a treat, he looks disproportionately thrilled. “Oh yeah? Right on, brother!” He beckons me over, pulls out his mobile phone and shows me a video of the man on whom he based Luis: a friend-of-a-friend named Pablo. I watch Pablo holding court at a barbecue, filling the gaps between words with superfluous chirrups, like a child colouring right to the edges of the page. His hands carve crazy shapes in the air as he babbles. That’s Luis alright. How did Pablo receive the news that he had been immortalised in a Marvel movie? “He was, like, ‘Oh that’s cool, that’s cool, man, so basically, yeah, wassup-wassup-wassup …’ He doesn’t care. He’s got his own life.” Related: Paul Rudd on Ant-Man, being Hollywood’s go-to nice guy and growing up with English parents in Kansas It isn’t the first time Peña has modelled a character on a real person. The drawling, slow-motion goofiness of the millionaire baseball-team owner he played in the HBO series Eastbound & Down was inspired by a man he met while on a cruise with his wife and their six-year-old son. “This guy looked like he had a lot of money. He was all, ‘Uh-huh, uh-huh, isss cool, isss cool …’” The shopping mall security guard in Observe and Report, with his bling and his perm, was written as African-American; Peña, the son of Mexican immigrants, thought it would be funnier if he played it as though he thought he were black. “I saw this little guy in a documentary about pimps. He was saying, ‘Man, you gots to love yo beeches …’ I thought, that’s him. That’s the character.’” He prefers to work that way, he says, from the outside in. “What’s funny isn’t really me. What I do is point out what I find funny in others.” Either way, it’s Peña getting the laughs. He can switch in a flash to sombre drama – he has played two fathers hit by the death of their child, first in the Oscar-winning Crash, then in Gracepoint, the US remake of Broadchurch. He was also bravely undemonstrative in his only leading role to date, as the labour leader and activist Cesar Chavez in the biopic of the same name. But throw in roles such as the fake sheikh in American Hustle and a disgruntled elevator man taking revenge on his Bernie Madoff-style boss in Tower Heist, and that’s a lot of comedy for someone who isn’t funny. Did he hear his manager’s put-down as a challenge? “I think I did. I decided to go away and work on it and find a way in.” That’s his style. “I remember my seventh-grade chemistry teacher told me I’d never amount to anything. I thought, ‘Hmm. OK.’ That gave me motivation to prove her wrong. I had to work hard because high school was crowded. Getting special attention was difficult.” He moved schools a lot in Chicago – I make it 12. “Twelve? Let me see … St Catherine … St Nicks … Hubbard …” I sit there while he sweetly counts out his schools on his fingers. “Ten!” he says with a triumphant laugh. “But that’s still a lot.” Why so many? “Well, at one school, there was this nun who thought I was a smart-ass because I was always done with my work early. She kept giving me Cs even when I got 100%. Mum took me out of that school.” And the others? “She just kept moving me,” he says, sounding a touch bewildered. He queries my description of his childhood neighbourhoods as “tough”. “They weren’t really tough. Just poor. There was a lot of gang stuff. I saw people die right in front of me. It’s normal when it’s all you know. I didn’t realise I lived in the ghetto until we moved out.” Ten years ago, he went back there with an ex-girlfriend. “I was telling her, ‘I’ve lived some tough shit. It was totally rad.’ But it had all been gentrified. “She was, like, ‘Oh yeah? Were the lines real long at the coffee shop?’” “I went into acting ass-backwards: instead of loving it and then getting paid, I got paid and then loved it Peña managed to resist the gangs. (“I’m not a good follower.”) Acting got him out of Chicago, but it wasn’t anything as exalted as a calling. He did it for the money. His mother was ill so he started going up for auditions. “I tried to pay for her care, but I only became successful after she passed away.” It wasn’t until a few years ago that he started owning up to the real reason he started acting. “I went into this thing ass-backwards. Instead of loving it and then getting paid, I got paid and then loved it. I started checking out great movies. I must’ve seen A Streetcar Named Desire 100 times. I want to be a part of things of that calibre. I want to leave a good impression.” That one is safely in the bag. But he still has ambitions left to fulfil. Last time we met, he was wishing that someone would cast him as the lead in a romantic comedy. He’s still waiting. “I think that could be cool. I could be a regular guy who’s just funny.” He thinks for a moment. “When Juan Met Sally? Something like that?” Ant-Man is released on Friday.

Options: - basement - antarctic - house - cellar - heat building Explain why a human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above: A:","response":"A human would choose \\"house\\" as the answer to the question, \\"where does a furnace usually heat?\\" because a furnace is designed to provide warmth and maintain a comfortable indoor environment for residential spaces – particularly homes. While each of the other options might be associated with either heating or the presence of a furnace, the primary purpose of a furnace is centered around maintaining warmth within living spaces, which makes \\"house\\" the most accurate and relevant response among the options given. Let's explore the alternatives to provide a clearer understanding of why \\"house\\" is the best choice: 1. Basement: A basement may indeed be a location where a furnace is installed, but this option does not capture the essence of the question, as it merely indicates the physical location of the furnace and not the intended area it is meant to heat. Furnaces are installed in basements to supply heat to the entire house; thus, selecting \\"basement\\" as an answer would not fully address the question's intent. 2. Antarctic: The Antarctic is a geographic region at the Earth's southernmost continent. Although it experiences extremely cold temperatures, this option does not relate to the purpose or function of a furnace. Moreover, furnaces are typically used for heating indoor spaces, not entire regions or continents. 3. Cellar: A cellar can be compared to a basement as it is an enclosed underground space within a house, often used for storage purposes. While a furnace might be located in a cellar, the main purpose of the furnace is still to provide heating to the entire house. Similar to the basement reasoning, choosing \\"cellar\\" omits the overall objective of a furnace – to heat the entire living space. 4. Heat building: This option could be a potential answer if the question were about a furnace’s purpose. However, it is unclear whether \\"heat building\\" refers to a specific type of building or if it simply rephrases the act of heating a building. Consequently, this option lacks clarity and specificity compared to \\"house,\\" which straightforwardly indicates the space where a furnace is typically used. In summary, although some of the other options provided can be related to the presence or function of a furnace, a human would choose \\"house\\" because it is the most accurate answer aligning with the core purpose of a furnace – to provide heating to living spaces, specifically residential homes."},{"question":"Question: What health issue did Jane's aunt have?

A pony bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily. I began to properly worry about him. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with a Dartmoor's Livestock Protection officer and send her a photo. The officer immediately sent a local farmer out to check on the pony. The pony had actually been trapped between two rocks. The farmer freed him, and he began to run happily around again.

ISLAMABAD | ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 24 people in Pakistan on Thursday in the latest militant attack since the death of Osama bin Laden which has angered Pakistan and led to a call for the United States to withdraw some of its military trainers. The killing of bin Laden by U.S. special forces in a Pakistani town on May 2 has sparked a wave of militant attacks and has also led to a sharp erosion of trust between Pakistan and its ally, the United States. A suicide car-bomber set off explosives outside a police station in the northwestern town of Hangu a day after a similar attack destroyed a police station in the city of Peshawar. \\"We're trying to remove rubble and there's fear some people could be trapped,\\" a government official in Hangu, Adil Siddique, told Reuters by telephone. Police said the toll could rise beyond 24 as many among 45 people wounded were in serious condition. Pakistani Taliban militants, allied with al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. They have vowed revenge for bin Laden's death. The raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Islamabad, intensified U.S. questions about Pakistan's possible role in sheltering militants, straining an already fragile relationship. But many Pakistanis saw the top-secret U.S. raid as a violation of sovereignty and some members of parliament have asked for a review of ties with Washington, which gives Pakistan billions of dollars in aid to help in the war against Islamist militants. Pakistan had informed the United States in the last week or two that it would not need some U.S. special forces trainers advising the Pakistani military, the Pentagon said. Pakistani security officials said the decision came three days after the al Qaeda leader's death. \\"We don't need unnecessary people here. They cause problems for us instead of being helpful,\\" said a Pakistani security official who declined to be identified. He said the withdrawal might start by early June. Another Pakistani security official said the decision was made because of concerns over the Americans' security and because \\"resentment all around was very high.\\" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said there had been \\"no real change\\" to the small U.S. military training mission in Pakistan. The number of trainers in Pakistan was not disclosed but Lapan said the entire military mission has ranged between 200 and 300 people. Other Pakistani and U.S. military sources in Pakistan have said the special forces training component formerly numbered about 120 and would be drawn down to less than 50. Other U.S. troops are involved in helicopter maintenance, liaising with the Pakistani military and aid efforts. It is unclear if they will also be withdrawn. \\"Essential people are being asked to stay,\\" the second security official said. \\"This includes SSG (special forces) and technical assistance.\\" While seeking answers to questions surrounding bin Laden's movements, the United States has been keen to prevent a complete breakdown in relations with an ally whose help is seen as essential for efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan. \\"BITTER FIGHT\\" While hinting that Pakistan could do more in its counter-terrorism efforts, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised it as a \\"good partner.\\" \\"We do have a set of expectations that we are looking for the Pakistani government to meet, but I want to underscore in conclusion it is not as though they have been on the sidelines,\\" Clinton told a news conference in Paris. She gave no details. \\"They have been actively engaged in their own bitter fight ... and we are going to look to put our partnership on as strong a foundation going forward as possible,\\" she said. As the United States starts to withdraw troops from Afghanistan this year and some U.S. lawmakers are urging the Obama administration to reconsider assistance to Pakistan in the wake of the bin Laden raid. U.S. aid has also led to quarrels between Pakistan's civilian government and its armed forces over how U.S. military funds were spent, according to WikiLeaks, highlighting the turf battles and lack of transparency over billions of dollars. U.S. diplomatic cables in 2009, published by Dawn newspaper, showed then Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin asked the U.S. embassy to keep him informed of American aid given directly to the military, saying the army chief did not pass on the information. At the same time, some Pakistan government officials feared money from a special reimbursement fund was being \\"siphoned off into private coffers.\\" Washington, too, was concerned military funds were being diverted by the civilian government for social programs, cables said. Many critics wonder if U.S. aid is misspent to beef up Pakistan's military capabilities against old rival India, or possibly to bolster its nuclear weapons program. Pakistan has received 20.7 billion worth of U.S. assistance over the past decade, about two-thirds of it military aid intended to improve the army's capabilities against militants.

The attack took place just weeks after the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which led to an increase in militant attacks and a significant decline in trust between the two countries. The Pakistani Taliban, allied with al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Hangu, vowing revenge for bin Laden's death. The bombing targeted a police station, coming after a similar attack on a police station in Peshawar. Rescue efforts were complicated as some individuals were possibly trapped under the rubble. The raid that killed bin Laden put a spotlight on Pakistan’s potential role in sheltering militants and put a strain on the already fragile relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. Many Pakistanis saw the raid as a violation of their sovereignty, with some members of parliament calling for a review of ties with Washington, which provided Pakistan with billions of dollars in aid to assist in the war against Islamist militants. In response, Pakistan informed the United States that it would not need some U.S. special forces trainers advising the Pakistani military. Pakistani security officials claimed that the decision was made due to concerns over the Americans' security and the high level of resentment in the country, with the withdrawal possibly starting in early June. The United States, while seeking answers about bin Laden's movements, aimed to prevent a complete breakdown in relations with Pakistan, as their help was seen as crucial for stabilizing neighboring Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that more could be done in counter-terrorism efforts but praised Pakistan as a \\"good partner.\\" The situation also had implications for U.S. aid to Pakistan, as some U.S. lawmakers urged the Obama administration to reconsider assistance in the wake of the bin Laden raid. There were debates between Pakistan's civilian government and its armed forces over the use of U.S. military funds, with concerns raised about transparency and potential misuse of the aid for purposes other than combating militancy."},{"question":"Write an article with the title: \\"Wil Wheaton on his new show, dealing with depression and why he dislikes interviews\\"","response":"Step 1: Research To write an article on Wil Wheaton, his new show, his struggles with depression, and his dislike for interviews, I would need to gather information on each of these topics.

Title: Wil Wheaton on his new show, dealing with depression, and why he dislikes interviews"},{"question":"Given the question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what did freud say about women? The answer is:","response":"Sigmund Freud, a renowned Austrian neurologist and the founding father of psychoanalysis, made several significant and often controversial contributions to the understanding of the human mind and its development. Among these are his ideas and theories regarding female sexuality and women, which have received considerable attention and criticism over the years. Freud's theories on women can be understood in the context of the following concepts: 1. Female Psychosexual Development: Freud's psychosexual theory of development emphasized that the early childhood years are critical in the formation of adult personality and sexual identity. He believed that girls, like boys, go through different stages of psychosexual development, including the oral, anal, and phallic stages. However, Freud believed that girls experience a different set of complex emotions and desires, particularly in the context of the Oedipus complex during the phallic stage. 2. Oedipus Complex: In his view, girls between the ages of 3 and 6 would develop a sexual attraction towards their fathers, accompanied by a sense of rivalry with their mothers. Freud called this the \\"Electra complex,\\" which is characterized by feelings of jealousy, attachment, and competition. In the course of resolving this complex, a young girl would supposedly come to identify with her mother and internalize feminine values, thus forming her own gender identity. 3. Penis Envy: One of the most debated aspects of Freud's theories on women is the concept of \\"penis envy.\\" Freud suggested that during the phallic stage of psychosexual development, girls would become aware of the anatomical differences between the sexes. Upon realizing that they do not have a penis, girls would supposedly experience feelings of envy and inferiority, leading them to desire a penis and, consequently, to experience a sense of symbolic loss. Freud believed that this feeling eventually transitions into a desire for a male child, viewing it as a way to compensate for the perceived lack of a penis and gain symbolic power. 4. Feminine Sexuality: Freud's perspective on feminine sexuality was rooted in the belief that it evolves from a primary focus on the clitoris to a more mature, vaginal-based sexuality in adulthood. He saw clitoral stimulation as an immature form of sexuality and regarded vaginal orgasms as the ultimate expression of mature feminine sexuality. This perspective has since been criticized and challenged by many experts in the field, who argue that such a distinction between different types of feminine orgasms is unfounded. 5. Women's Roles and Mental Health: Additionally, Freud's works often explored the connection between women's roles in society and their emotional and mental well-being. He was particularly interested in the psychological strain caused by societal expectations and restrictions placed on women, which he believed might contribute to symptoms of hysteria and other neurotic disorders. While Freud's theories on women have undoubtedly influenced the field of psychology and our understanding of the human mind, they should also be viewed within the context of their time and the prevailing attitudes towards women's roles, capacities, and experiences. In conclusion, Sigmund Freud's ideas and theories about women attempted to explain female psychosexual development, feminine sexuality, and their mental health in relation to societal expectations and restrictions. However, it is crucial to remember that his ideas have been subject to significant criticism, revision, and debate over the decades. While some of his concepts, like the Oedipus complex, still hold influence in certain domains of contemporary psychoanalytic theory, others, such as the idea of penis envy, have been widely discredited or called into question by both scholars and mental health professionals alike."},{"question":"Answer the following question: What director in 2008 worked with the actress who portrayed the fictional character of Rebecca in the 2016 supernatural horror film \\"Lights Out?\\" Answer:","response":"Step 1: Identify the actress who portrayed Rebecca in the 2016 supernatural horror film \\"Lights Out.\\" - The actress who played Rebecca in \\"Lights Out\\" is Teresa Palmer.

Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989. A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria. The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse. An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Did he play in Yugoslavia?","response":"Yes, Drazen Petrovic played basketball in Yugoslavia. He started his professional basketball career in Europe during the 1980s and represented the Yugoslavian national team in several competitions, including the Balkan Championships and FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He also played for the Yugoslavian national team in the 1984 Summer Olympics and many other international tournaments before playing in the NBA."},{"question":"Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON — At a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday about procedures in redistricting cases, the justices appeared to be trying to reconcile two conflicting impulses. They did not want to close the door entirely on challenges to gerrymandering, but they also did not want to be required to rule on them. Though the court has never rejected a voting district on the ground that it gave a political party an unconstitutional advantage, it has never ruled out that such a district might exist. On Wednesday, the court seemed inclined to endorse procedures that would at least treat such claims seriously by sending them to special three-judge courts created by a federal law for redistricting cases. But as the argument drew to a close, several justices voiced a competing concern — the law also allows direct appeals to the Supreme Court from rulings of the three-judge courts, meaning more work and less discretion for the justices. The case, Shapiro v. McManus, No. 14-990, is a challenge to Maryland’s 2011 congressional maps. Democrats, the challengers said, had gone to elaborate and unconstitutional lengths to create oddly shaped districts to favor their candidates. A single federal trial judge dismissed the case, saying it did not present issues serious enough to warrant convening a three-judge court. In the first part of the argument, several justices seemed to disagree. “They want to raise about as important a question as you can imagine,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of the challengers. “And if they are right, that would affect congressional districts and legislative districts throughout the nation.” The argument was unusually sleepy, lasting 47 minutes instead of the usual hour and going for long stretches without questions from the bench. As it neared the end, it took a turn, with justices raising concerns about their workload and their ability to shape their own docket. “There are a lot of cases that come up in three-judge district courts that would be the kind of case — I speak for myself, anyway — that we might” decide not to review if they arrived in the usual course, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. “With the three-judge district court, no, we have to decide it on the merits.” Justice Breyer echoed that point. “If there is a set of cases where this court should be careful as to when and how and which it enters in which order,” he said, it is those involving sensitive political issues. “If we accept your view,” he told Michael D. Kimberly, a lawyer for the challengers, “we have to take immediately whatever variations on the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they happen to arise, because we have no choice.” Much of the discussion concerned how legally tenuous a claim had to be before single judges could act on their own. Chief Justice Roberts did not seem satisfied with the available distinctions, which he said created “an awfully fuzzy line” and gave no guidance to judges. Justice Elena Kagan said the category of cases in which a judge could act alone should be very narrow if the test is whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the case at all. “We’ve basically said that’s only when it’s completely ridiculous,” she said, one where “it’s just a laughingstock of a case.” Steven M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Maryland, created some confusion with a description of the sorts of cases so frivolous that any judge should be entitled to dismiss them. “It’s easy when it’s the little green men and the extraterrestrials,” he said. That was probably a reference to Justice David H. Souter’s dissent in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, a 2009 decision that made it easier to dismiss all kinds of lawsuits at the outset. (It is appropriate, Justice Souter wrote, to dismiss “claims about little green men, or the plaintiff’s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.”) But the reference seemed lost on Justice Antonin Scalia, who asked several questions about how extraterrestrials figured in the case.

Now, after a top-to-bottom renovation, this former slum is a light-filled family house. And, although the restoration project cost 1.27 million, the work, plus strong market conditions over the past four years, means the house is now valued at an estimated 5.7 million. Their house, in the affluent northwest London neighborhood of Islington, had been owned for decades by Fran and Jay Landesman, an elderly and rather eccentric couple whose lifestyle has been chronicled in British newspapers by their journalist son, Cosmo. He gave their home the “most expensive slum” moniker in a newspaper article in 2010, recounting how his aging hippie parents refused to throw anything away and regarded cleaning as a “bourgeois hang-up.” After Fran and Jay died, Mr. Landesman put the house up for sale, and in 2012 the Baldwin-Taylors agreed to buy it. The couple—he’s 43 and she’s 36—had been living in Ghana, working for a shipping and logistics company. But they wanted to return to Britain full time so that their daughter Maya, now 7, could be educated in England. The neglected house’s structural instability was one challenge the family faced. The other was that, because the house was an example of classic Georgian architecture, any work they carried out had to be approved by the local council. Initially, the couple had hoped to enlarge the kitchen but were refused building permits. Instead they added a garden room at the end of their backyard and expanded the existing basement—moves that increased the property’s square footage from 2,850 square feet to around 3,000 square feet. Along with shoring up precarious ceilings, waterproofing the basement, and restoring load-bearing walls that the Landesmans had knocked down, the homeowners’ main challenge was to conserve the house’s original features with the help of Gerard Rainey, senior architect at the firm Architecture for London. “We wanted to retain as much of the Georgian features as we could,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “The house also felt very dark, and very convoluted, and we wanted to make it as bright, and as classy, as possible.” They reclaimed original wide pine floorboards from elsewhere in the house to restore the living room floor. They hunted down a grate for the fireplace that was also of the correct period to fit the house and replaced postwar windows with modern re-creations of original Georgian sash windows. Their kitchen is an exercise in simplicity: wood cabinets painted gray; chunky, white Corian countertops and a white marble-tiled backsplash. While the palette in most of the rest of the house is pale and neutral, Mrs. Baldwin has let her love of color loose in the living room, with sofas in rich navy blue, teal and purple. Double doors open onto a study, with walls painted a deep charcoal that sets off a modern, scarlet chandelier. The couple’s master bedroom suite, one of the home’s four bedrooms, is at the top of the five-story property. The build started in July 2014, and the family moved in last April. Work continued until August on the basement, which now has a living room, bedroom and bathroom. The adjacent “coal hole” is now a kitchen. Outside, they added a decked terrace area with built-in barbecue and steps that lead down to a paved patio framed by curved, raised flower beds. Mr. Rainey worked around a London plane tree, designing a garden room with a curved roof echoing the flower beds. This room could be a study or a sitting room, but is currently being used as a guest bedroom suite. The family is now settling into their new home. “It is fantastic,” said Mrs. Baldwin. “I used to walk through this street as a teenager and think how I would love to live here one day, so in many ways it is a culmination of a very old dream for me.”","response":"Caroline Baldwin and Brian Taylor purchased a run-down Georgian townhouse for £1.8 million (2.5 million) in Islington, a wealthy area in northwest London. The property, dubbed \\"the most expensive slum in Britain\\" by its former owner, was in such a state of disrepair that they first had to install scaffolding to prevent further damage. After investing 1.27 million in a comprehensive renovation, the couple transformed the former slum into a luxurious, light-filled family home.

You can glue it. B). You can solder it.","response":"I choose option A). You can glue it Step-by-step explanation: 1. Gather materials: Before starting, gather the necessary materials, which include the paper, cardboard, and glue. Using glue is the best option here, as it is specifically designed for attaching paper and similar materials, whereas soldering is meant for joining metal components. 2. Align the paper: Place the paper on a flat surface, ensuring it is properly aligned over the cardboard. This step is crucial for making sure the paper attaches to the cardboard neatly and without any unsightly wrinkles or creases. 3. Apply glue: Apply glue to the back of the paper or directly onto the cardboard surface, depending on the type of glue you're using. Be sure to follow the glue's instructions to make sure you're using the appropriate amount and application method. 4. Attach paper to cardboard: Carefully place the paper onto the glued surface of the cardboard. Press down gently and evenly across the entire surface of the paper to eliminate any air bubbles and ensure a strong bond between the paper and cardboard. 5. Allow time to dry: Once the paper is in place, give it time to dry according to the glue manufacturer's recommended drying time. This might vary depending on the specific glue brand and type being used. 6. Trim excess edges: If any excess paper or glue is visible along the edges of the cardboard, trim it off carefully with a pair of scissors or a utility knife. By following these steps, you can attach paper to a sheet of cardboard using glue (option A), ensuring a clean and professional appearance."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = high, familyFriendly = no, near = Burger King.

The premise appears to be somewhat disjointed and unclear in conveying a precise message. However, we can attempt to deconstruct and analyze the statement to gain a better understanding of the speaker's potential intentions. Part 1: \\"i really do i yeah it's going to take uh you know the the police\\" This section appears to suggest that the speaker believes the involvement of the police is necessary or important in resolving a particular situation. Part 2: \\"i think\\" The speaker indicates that the forthcoming statement is their personal opinion or a matter of conjecture. Part 3: \\"i don't think can do it uh can do it alone you know\\" In this part, the speaker expresses doubt about whether the police can resolve the situation single-handedly. The use of \\"alone\\" implies that furthermore, other entities or individuals might be needed to achieve a solution. Taking these three parts into consideration, the overall message seems to indicate that the speaker believes the police play a significant role in addressing a specific issue. However, the statement also suggests that the police may not be able to resolve the problem independently and may require the assistance of other actors. As such, it would be inaccurate to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The police are the only ones who can bring a solution\\" is true based solely on this premise. The speaker's opinion introduces the possibility that, while the police play an important role, their efforts may need to be supplemented or supported by others.

Most follow the women-in-prison formula, only relocated to a concentration camp, death camp, or Nazi brothel, and with an added emphasis on sadism, gore, and degradation. The most infamous and influential title (which set the standards of the genre) is a Canadian production, \\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\" (1974). Its surprise success and sequels led European film-makers, mostly in Italy, to produce dozens of similar films.

The violence erupted after raids by members of the National Guard broke up four tent camps maintained by student activists. Hundreds of demonstrators poured on to the streets and set up barricades. Masked youths threw stones and petrol bombs, while police responded with tear gas. Witnesses said shots were fired from buildings into the streets, but this could not be confirmed. Mr Rodriguez said 243 protesters had been detained and that the authorities were currently determining whom to charge. He said protesters had used the camps as bases to launch \\"violent attacks\\", after which they would \\"hide... saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest\\". Earlier this week, the pressure group Human Rights Watch accused Venezuelan security forces of illegally detaining and abusing protesters. Demonstrations were triggered by frustration with Venezuela's high crime rates and poor economic situation but have grown into a wider anti-government movement. Students have been at the forefront of the protests, erecting barricades and organising demonstrations and sit-ins. The government has labelled the protesters \\"fascist agitators\\", accusing them of fomenting a coup against the left-wing government of President Maduro \\"with US backing\\". Summary:","response":"During a wave of anti-government protests in Venezuela, a police officer was killed by a sniper, and more than 240 people were arrested following raids on four protest camps.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria. Consequently, when Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him. As soon as the newlyweds arrive in Hong Kong, however, Walter becomes consumed with his medical work, and Katrin becomes the romantic target of Jack Townsend, the unhappily married attaché to the British embassy. While showing her the city's exotic sights, Jack flirts with Katrin and kisses her. Katrin, unnerved by Jack's actions, retreats to her house, but soon rejoins him to observe local dancers performing at a Buddhist festival. Stimulated by the dancing and the atmosphere of a Buddhist temple, Jack confesses his love to Katrin, and Katrin admits that she is not in love with Walter. At home, Katrin then treats Walter coolly and reveals that his chronic lateness and fatigue annoy her. To make amends, Walter comes home early the next day, but discovers Katrin's bedroom door locked and Jack's hat on a table. That evening, Walter confronts Katrin with his suspicions, and she admits that she loves Jack. Distraught, Walter tells Katrin that he will grant her a divorce only if Jack promises in writing that he will divorce his wife and marry her. When Katrin presents Walter's conditions to Jack, he tells her that a divorce would ruin both his career and his reputation and backs out of the affair. The answer is:","response":"The profession of the person that Olga's sister, Katrin Koerber, is not in love with is a British bacteriologist. This fact is established based on the context given that states, \\"Dr. Walter Fane, a British bacteriologist, asks her to marry him and move to Hong Kong, she agrees, even though she is not in love with him.\\" Dr. Walter Fane gets consumed with his work upon their arrival in Hong Kong which causes a distance between them. Katrin is courted by Jack Townsend, an attaché to the British embassy, and she admits to him that she isn't in love with her husband, Walter. Despite the romantic advances of Jack Townsend, Katrin's lack of love concerns her husband, Dr. Walter Fane, the British bacteriologist. Therefore, in the context of the question, the profession of the person that Olga's sister is not in love with is a bacteriologist, more specifically, a British bacteriologist."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A young girl in a bathing suit.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Drinking from a green glass bottle.\\" is true?

Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"Oh! Lice are tiny bugs that live in people's hair, and they can be quite bothersome. It's important to get rid of them. Here are two methods for you to choose from: 1. Lice treatment shampoo 2. Wet combing It sounds like you would like me to tell you which one is more reasonable to use. So, let me explain each option like you are a five-year-old: 1. Lice treatment shampoo is a special shampoo that helps to kill the lice and their eggs. You put it on your hair, let it sit for a while, and then wash it off. This can be a quick way to get rid of lice, but sometimes you may need to do it more than once. 2. Wet combing is when you use a special comb called a \\"lice comb\\" to brush through wet hair. The comb has very fine teeth and is designed to catch the lice and eggs as you brush. This method takes more time and patience, but it doesn't involve any chemicals. It's important to do this every few days for a couple of weeks to make sure you get all the lice and eggs out. Both methods can be effective, but the lice treatment shampoo might be considered more reasonable if you want a quicker solution. However, if you prefer a chemical-free option, choosing wet combing could be more reasonable for you."},{"question":"Here is a premise: \\"A girl wearing a blue floral patterned dress is sitting on the cement and sorting leaves.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The girl is wearing a green patterned dress.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?

There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a \\"UFOlogist\\" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins. The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can't say much you without writing a spoiler.

It's sit-down in the same way that Chipotle is sit-down. They serve wine and beer, but maybe I'm just not used to that in a non-table-service establishement. Unlike Osteria 100, the pizzas are a good size for lunch. The first time I went, a friend and I split a Ceasar salad and a Vesuvius pizza. Portions were fine for a light lunch. The second time I had one pizza myself. The dough quality is excellent - thin, toasted on the edges, and soft within. The taste is so fresh - much like Il Pizziaolo in Mt Lebo. I've since had the Quattro Formaggi and the Prosciutto y Fungi and both were great. This is a great addition to the downtown lunch scene. I hope they do well - the location is on the very edge of town - and nice to see that they are open past 3pm. Would be a cool happy hour place if they had a bar, but there's just no room for one. With the right wine list it would be kind of like having Dinette minutes from my office. Two downsides: 1. Noise! It's all hard surfaces, so conversations travel. In their defense, it's all glass on two sides, so no much you can do there. 2. THere is no vestibule, so on wintry days there are big chills rushing in with every patron.

Article: Millions of children in the United States go to summer camps. Some go to play outdoors at traditional camps in the woods, in the mountains or on lakes. But families now have many choices of special camps. These can be in the middle of nature or a big city. Special camps offer young people the chance to learn about different subjects: anything from space exploration to business to medicine. In technology camps, one subject that children can learn about is video game design. They learn how to use computer programs to create games of their own. One program that teaches video game design is called Cybercamps. Children can learn how to design their own virtual worlds to set their video game in. Then, they program their own rules and objects into the game. Cybercamps also offers courses in robot building and Web design. A recent story in the Washington Post described how one child made a robot that could sing a song. Another made a robot that could follow a black line drawn on a piece of cardboard.

During my entire school years I was in a white environment , with racist people . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"Yes, the two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Here are the main reasons: 1. Both sentences carry the same overall meaning. They both communicate that the speaker spent their entire school years in a predominantly white environment with people who were racist. 2. Paraphrasing usually involves changing the syntax (sentence structure) or diction (word choice) without altering the core meaning. In this case, the sentences vary slightly in syntax and diction—\\"During all my school years\\" vs. \\"During my entire school years\\"—but the content they're conveying stays the same. 3. Every element of the first sentence has a corresponding element in the second sentence, and vice versa. The context or the meaning of neither sentence extends beyond what is expressed in the other. So, based on these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that these two sentences are paraphrases of each other."},{"question":"Rupert Murdoch supposedly wished his old employee Piers Morgan well, but not too much success in his new gig on CNN. The News Corp. chairman, ever mindful of Fox News' profits, needn't have worried. \\"Piers Morgan Tonight\\" is the second holdover from CNN's former management, and to say the show's debut was more polished than \\"Parker-Spitzer\\" is hardly an unqualified endorsement. Instead, Morgan was so deferential in his hour-long chat with Oprah Winfrey that the adjective she used to describe his interviewing skills -- \\"Surprising\\" -- seemed very generous indeed. \\"Boring\\" would be more accurate. Morgan -- known as an interviewer in the U.K., and an \\"America's Got Talent\\" judge in the U.S. -- didn't really press Winfrey on any front. Sure, he asked some questions about her personal life, her wealth, her role in campaigning for Barack Obama, but he let her prattle on about her \\"mission\\" and larger purpose without any mention of the messianic terms she regularly uses to discuss herself and her media empire. To her credit, Winfrey -- in saying she was in no way disappointed with Obama's presidency -- reminded Morgan that there's a \\"learning curve\\" in any job, and it would be unfair to judge him based strictly on this first program. But other than laughing too hard at her jokes and being generally pleasant, it's hard to see how this is any improvement over what Larry King was doing in the timeslot, other than being about three decades younger. The front-loaded lineup of first-week guests includes Howard Stern, Ricky Gervais and George Clooney. But any nightly (or daily) show of this kind is only as good as its host, and if this is the template, Morgan won't offer much reason to tune in on nights when he has lesser newsmakers. The premiere, notably, went up against about as partisan a night on CNN's cable rivals as you're apt to find: Sean Hannity sitting in Sarah Palin's lap (not quite literally) on Fox News' \\"Hannity,\\" while Rachel Maddow hosted Michael Moore to discuss gun-control legislation on MSNBC. Hannity pitched softballs at Palin for a full half-hour, before segueing to Michael Reagan to criticize his brother's book about their father. For hard-core conservatives, that's the equivalent of having Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in your lineup. It would be lovely if CNN had the smarts to offer a legitimate alternative to those political poles, but based on first impressions, \\"Piers Morgan\\" isn't it. ||||| cable news news Piers Morgan Takes On Oprah, and Comes Up Short After weeks of building buzz, on Monday night it was finally time for Piers Morgan Tonight to fill television's biggest suspenders in the nine o'clock CNN slot that Larry King made famous. Morgan's interviews will clearly be more personal and pointed. He came across as polite and intelligent, and clearly does his homework. But his choice of Oprah Winfrey as his first guest was a drastic error. From the hotel room interview set — more Barbara Walters Fascinating People than anything resembling King's familiar dark-room-and-desk setup — to his obsequious bowing and scraping, the interview with the reigning queen of TV made him look like a commoner. The thing is, Morgan's no amateur. He's a journalist with decades of experience in print and television — not that he appeared that way in a sedate hotel room filled with flowers and cigar boxes. (There's a reason Barbara uses rooms like this, and Diane Sawyer, and the good people of 60 Minutes. Their interviews are soft. They're restrained. Piers is big and loud. His normal set, which it seems like he'll start using later this week for a sit-down with Howard Stern, is much more suited to him.) Not being an amateur is one thing. Trying to face off with Oprah Winfrey is quite another. She is a legendary interviewer and an alpha dog, and she put Piers through his paces. Nine minutes in, she was telling him exactly what he wasn't going to get out of her, saying, \\"You're wasting your time with the Stedman thing!\\" She talked directly to the camera. After Piers asked whether she had ever been in therapy, she turned the query right around on him and went on the attack. When he asked her what advice she'd give to Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, she calmly stated that she'd be saving that for when she got Vick on her own show. And near the end of the interview, she just told him what question he should ask her. (It was, \\"What do you do best?\\" When Piers asked it, Oprah gave a canned, hokey answer.) Piers's final plea was, \\"How did I do?\\" It was the first time he'd asked it explicitly, but it seemed like the whole interview was about seeking Oprah's approval. He constantly asked how it was going, and backed off easily when Oprah rebuffed him — never pushing for something deeper or truer from the gifted talker. \\"C'mon,\\" he said, asking about the biggest check she ever wrote to the IRS. \\"Give the new boy a break.\\" His giggling style might have come across as charming in the studio on his own turf, or in an interview with someone less intimidating. Here it made him seem sycophantic and almost childish. When he reached out to her and said, \\"Everything you touch turns to gold. Could you touch me?\\" I almost turned off the television. It wasn't all bad, though. There were signs of life in his interviewing style. He asked questions that real people would want to ask Oprah, even though she'd been asked many of them before. Questions like \\"Do you feel regal?\\" and \\"Do you like being famous?\\" provoked interesting answers. Likewise, \\"How many times have you been properly in love?\\" Her painful story of going to live with her father as a secretly pregnant 14-year-old felt poignant and honest. And he got her to talk a little bit about being rich, which was funny and refreshing. \\"I'm not sitting around counting it,\\" Oprah said, brushing aside a question about her total worth. \\"I bet you know exactly how much you're worth!\\" Piers shot back. \\"Yes I do,\\" she conceded. So how did she know? \\"Because I'd already counted it,\\" she said. That was Piers's mistake in having Oprah on for his very first episode. He doesn't yet know how much he's worth in this new chair at CNN. But Oprah knows exactly how much she's worth, and it's definitely more than this untested — if bright and charming — British import. The gap in confidence, even muffled as it was by flowers and soft lighting, was glaring. ||||| The premiere of Piers Morgan Tonight revealed host Piers Morgan to be clever, tenacious, vain, a flatterer, and fitfully funny. Oh, and he had a big-name first guest: Oprah Winfrey, who talked about contemplating suicide at age 14, her quest to interview Michael Vick, and how many times she’s had her heart broken (twice). Morgan pumped up his subject shamelessly: “She’s the biggest, richest, most powerful star in the world!” “You would make a fantastic mother!” “Everything you touch is a hit — could you just touch me?” Morgan, reaching for the highest compliment a fawning British subject could pay a woman, said Winfrey was “the American Queen.” Oprah replied, regally: “I will accept it.” The America’s Got Talent judge has a bit of a doughy face and a small mouth (this is what happens when you host a talk show with at least as many close-ups on you as on your guest — people look more closely at you), and his clever-schoolboy demeanor serves him well. The hosts revealed they were both trying to book dog fancier Michael Vick as a guest, and Morgan offered to bet her “100 British pounds” on who’ll snap him up first. “Make it two,” said Oprah coolly. Oprah gassed on and on about her newly launched OWN network, which was doubtlessly a big reason she agreed to the highly publicized interview. But she was more interesting, of course, when she inadvertently revealed her ego — she said her role in life is nothing less than to “evolve the consciousness” of people. More interesting was her self-definition: “I am a Negro, formerly, born in 1954, in Mississippi when it was an apartheid state” and that therefore it was “a miracle,” what she’s attained. She spoke about losing a baby when she was 14, saying that the loss was “a relief” because “I thought I was going to have to kill myself,” given the strict rules she was raised under at home. In general, Winfrey was probably as open as she’s ever been with an interviewer, which is to say, not much, but Morgan extracted some nice moments, even if he had to beg: “Give a new boy a break.” As for whether the “new boy” is a worthy replacement for Larry King… come on, you didn’t watch Larry King Live, did you? Simply by having facts about his subject at hand and speaking coherently, Morgan aced King on his opening night. I’m looking forward to seeing him interview Howard Stern tomorrow night. Did you watch Piers Morgan Tonight? Twitter: @kentucker ||||| Piers Morgan (Credit: GETTY) If he'd watched this, Ricky Gervais might just have needed a very large handkerchief. The debut of fellow Englishman Piers Morgan's talk show on CNN, the one in which he officially succeeded Larry King, showed none of Gervais' pointed exposition of celebrity at the Golden Globes. Instead, Morgan's debut was a wonderful advertisement. A wonderful advertisement for Oprah Winfrey's new OWN TV channel. It was an advertisement in which Piers Morgan largely served as the announcer. It was an advertisement in which the Celebrity Apprentice positively begged to be allowed into the inner sanctum of Celebrity's Board of Directors. It even began with an advertisement for Oprah's new OWN channel, as if everyone should understand from the outset that this was product placement, not some in depth exploration of America's most popular woman. Morgan's nerves showed in his voice, his eyes and his desperation to have physical contact with his guest. Oprah looked benignly in his direction, as if he was a sweet, ambitious nephew whose mom had asked someone in the upper echelons of television to help him with his career. She did her best. Hers, as she said, is the Love Brand. So she tried to sprinkle a little love-dust upon his tightly-woven eyebrows. She called him good. Twice. But she also told him that he was going to get nothing newsworthy, nothing controversial, nothing titillating. In fact, by the end of the hour's show, what Oprah gave the well-prepped Morgan was nothing special. Nothing other than a schooling in what it was to know your self and your brand and to be able to control how you are seen. Morgan, in his British talk show, was able to get a mediocre singer and an equally mediocre prime minister to show genuine tears. Here, he was more successful in getting Oprah to show genuine pity at the obvious methods he was using in the hope of eliciting a headline, a snippet of her life story that had never before been revealed. Several times, she forced Morgan into the nervous laughter of a stair salesman who suddenly realizes he's in a ranch house. Oddly, his reputedly large and healthy ego nudged him to try and equate himself with her. Oprah explained that the end of her popular afternoon show wasn't the end of her career. She said: \\"I'm just getting started\\". Morgan's nervous schoolboy jaw-jerked him into \\"Aren't we all?\\" As if the two could somehow be compared. Morgan clearly felt that flattery would get him everywhere. \\"You are the American Queen,\\" he told Oprah, sounding so very much like Tony Blair naming the dead Diana Spencer \\"The People's Princess\\". Perhaps he might have tried to tell her something she doesn't know. The blue cards he clutched in his no doubt ever-moisting palms seemed to hold no key, no provocation that Oprah couldn't have seen coming without so much as the opening of an eye or the sniffing of a breeze. At one point, as if telling her audience not to worry, she spoke directly to the camera, rather than to him. She wasn't going to forget who she was. And neither would he.

Bennett wrote The Book of Virtue in which he suggested that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett's book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values, just like honesty, courage, loyalty and many others. For Americans, one basic moral value is honesty. The story about George Washington and the cherry tree teaches this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favourite cherry tree. When his father asked him about it, George said, \\"I did it.\\" Instead of punishment, his father spoke highly of him. Sometimes American honesty--being open and direct--can make people angry. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best virtue\\". Another virtue is perseverance . A story tells of a little train climbing a hill. The hill is too high to get over it. But the train just kept pulling, all the while saying, \\"I think I can, I think I can.\\" At last, the train was over the top because he did not give up. Compassion may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man with compassion. On his way home, he found a poor traveler lying on the road. The kind man, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. Compassion can even turn into a good cycle. In 1992, people in Iowa sent plenty of water to help Floridians hit by storms. The next summer, during the Midwest flood, Florida returned. Millions of Americans are quietly passing along the kindness shown to them. In no way can this book cover all the moral values honored (...) by Americans. But moral virtues are priceless, and they are the base of American culture and any culture.

It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Peron. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death. The musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. In Buenos Aires on July 26, 1952, an audience is watching a film (\\"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, July 26, 1952\\"). The film is interrupted when news breaks of the death of Eva Peron, Argentina's First Lady, at the age of 33. The nation goes into public mourning as they sing \\"Requiem for Evita\\" (in Latin, which is modelled on a Catholic requiem). Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \\"nothing, for years\\" (\\"Oh What a Circus\\"). In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte (later Eva Duarte de Peron) lives in the provincial town of Junin, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva falls in love with a tango singer, Agustin Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (\\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\\"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (\\"Eva, Beware of the City\\"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (\\"Buenos Aires\\"). After Magaldi leaves her, and Che relates the story of how Eva goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality (\\"Goodnight and Thank You\\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Peron, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\\"The Lady's Got Potential\\"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Peron and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (\\"The Art of the Possible\\"). After the 1944 San Juan earthquake, Peron organises a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Magaldi, who spurns her for her past actions. Peron addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (\\"Charity Concert\\"). Eva and Peron share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Peron rise to power (\\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\\"). Eva dismisses Peron's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (\\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\"). After moving in with Peron, Eva is introduced to high society, but she is met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (\\"Peron's Latest Flame\\"). In 1946, Peron launches his presidential bid after being promoted to general in the army, and while in bed with Eva, he discusses his chances of winning the election. Eva reassures him and soon they organise rallies where the people show their support and hope for a better future, while on the sidelines Peron and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\\"A New Argentina\\").

Question: suppose less blood plasma available happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","response":"If there is less blood plasma available in the body, it will impact the liver's functions in various ways. As the liver plays a critical role in maintaining the body's overall health and well-being, any alteration in the functioning of the liver, or its ability to work at a reduced capacity, could have significant implications for the system mentioned above. Here is a detailed explanation of how these effects might be influenced if the liver has to work \\"softer\\" due to less blood plasma available: 1. Liver filtering blood from the digestive tract: With less blood plasma available, the liver may filter blood from the digestive tract less efficiently. Filtering is crucial for detoxifying harmful substances and metabolizing nutrients, so any reduction in filtering capacity could lead to a buildup of toxins and slower distribution of essential nutrients. This may result in the liver working harder than usual to filter these substances, potentially causing fatigue or damage to liver cells. 2. Liver's bile production: Under the condition of reduced blood plasma availability, the liver might produce bile in smaller quantities. Bile is essential for the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, so decreased bile production could negatively impact digestion, leading to malabsorption and potential nutrient deficiencies. Further, since bile also helps in the excretion of waste products, reduced bile production may lead to the accumulation of waste that can be harmful to the body. 3. Liver producing proteins for blood plasma: With less blood plasma available, the liver's ability to produce proteins might be impacted. The liver synthesizes several essential proteins, including albumin and clotting factors, which are vital for maintaining blood plasma volume, blood pressure, and blood clotting. A decrease in the liver's capacity to generate these proteins could result in circulatory problems, a higher risk of bleeding, or the development of blood clots. 4. Liver converting excess glucose into glycogen for storage: In the scenario of reduced blood plasma availability, the liver may convert less excess glucose into glycogen for storage. Glycogen storage in the liver acts as an energy reserve, with glycogen being broken down into glucose when needed. If the liver produces and stores less glycogen due to decreased blood plasma availability, the body may have to rely more on other energy sources, such as fats, which could affect overall energy levels and metabolism. 5. Liver converting ammonia to urea: Ammonia is a toxic waste product generated during protein breakdown, and the liver is responsible for converting it into urea, a less toxic compound excreted through urine. With less blood plasma, the liver's ability to convert ammonia to urea might be impaired, potentially leading to a buildup of ammonia and its toxic effects on the body. This could cause symptoms like tiredness, confusion, and even life-threatening complications if not addressed promptly. 6. Liver regulating blood clotting: Blood clotting is a vital process that prevents excessive bleeding when injured. As the liver synthesizes proteins necessary for blood clotting, any reduction in protein production due to less blood plasma available might affect the liver's capacity to regulate blood clotting. This could increase the risk of uncontrolled bleeding or, conversely, increase the likelihood of developing blood clots that can lead to other complications, like deep vein thrombosis or stroke. In conclusion, less blood plasma available impacts the liver in several ways, causing it to work \\"softer\\" or less efficiently. The perturbation influences the second effect mentioned (liver's bile production) by potentially resulting in less bile production, negatively impacting digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste excretion. This reduced efficiency might lead to a cascade of adverse consequences on liver function and overall health."},{"question":"Write an article based on this summary: Exeter City forward Reuben Reid says he was elated to score his 100th career goal.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"pilots who fly planes need to be examined strictly\\" - Sentence B: \\"Bicycle drivers need to be examined strictly\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","response":"To determine which sentence is not logical, let's analyze the context and reasoning behind each statement. Sentence A: \\"Pilots who fly planes need to be examined strictly.\\" Logic: Pilots are responsible for the lives of numerous passengers and crew members, and their expertise directly impacts the safety of air travel. Hence, it is logical that pilots must undergo a strict examination process to ensure they are highly skilled and qualified for their job. Sentence B: \\"Bicycle drivers need to be examined strictly.\\" Logic: Bicycle drivers, while needing some basic understanding of traffic rules and safety measures, don't bear the same responsibility as pilots. The risks factors associated with riding a bicycle don't justify a strict examination requirement like that of pilots operating complex machines at high altitudes. Considering the reasoning behind each statement, Sentence B (\\"Bicycle drivers need to be examined strictly\\") is not logical compared to Sentence A, as requiring strict examinations for bicycle drivers doesn't hold the same significance as for pilots who fly planes."},{"question":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"People going through a buffet style line to design dyed eggs.\\" is it true that \\"People are sitting in a theater.\\"?

There is no mention of a theater or people sitting. Now, let's consider the statement: \\"People are sitting in a theater.\\" This statement describes a completely different situation where people are seated in a theater, presumably to watch a performance or a movie.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Human behavior is complex, and the internal thought processes and emotions that govern it are sometimes deeply ingrained and inaccessible to external observers. Facial expressions and body language are certainly some key indicators that can provide information about a person's thoughts and emotions; however, these signals might not always be accurate or reliable. For instance, some individuals are adept at masking their true feelings by intentionally controlling their facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures. This can make it difficult to ascertain their genuine emotions and thoughts. Moreover, various cultural, social, and personal factors may influence the way people express themselves. In some cultures, it is considered impolite to openly display certain emotions, which leads individuals to suppress or modify their facial expressions and body language. Additionally, people with certain psychological conditions, such as autism, may struggle to convey their emotions through typical social cues and may be misinterpreted by others. Lastly, even experts in reading facial expressions and body language, such as psychologists and law enforcement officers, can sometimes make errors in judgement. The fact is, while these external cues can provide valuable insights, they may not always specifically pinpoint a person’s thoughts and emotions. There's also the factor of individual variation; what might be a telltale sign for one person could be a normal behavior for another.

Craig set up traps in order to catch rats for Michael, because","response":"Michael had recently moved into an old, neglected house on the outskirts of town. The house had been vacant for years, and the previous inhabitants had left it in disarray. As a result, the place had become infested with rodents, and Michael needed help getting rid of them. For the first time since the move, Michael had found solace in his new life, far from the hustle and bustle of city life. He enjoyed the peace and quiet that surrounded the house, as well as the freedom to explore the vast expanse of woods behind the property. However, it was clear that he had to address the menacing rat problem that threatened to destroy his newfound sanctuary. Craig, Michael's lifelong friend and a seasoned exterminator, had volunteered to help him deal with the infestation. Over the years, Craig had developed a unique approach to trapping and exterminating pests. Instead of using cruel methods like glue traps or poison, he employed more humane techniques to catch the rodents and release them far away from inhabited areas. Together, the pair embarked on a mission to rid the house of its rat infestation. The two men spent hours inspecting the premises, filling in gaps and holes that the rats had used to infiltrate the house. Then, utilizing Craig's expertise, they designed and set up several ingenious traps to catch the rodents. The traps were built with care to avoid causing harm or discomfort to the rats while ensuring their capture. Every morning, Craig and Michael would carefully check the traps for any captured pests. If they found any, they would release the rodents several miles away from the house in a dense forest where they could live unharmed, far away from human habitation. As days turned into weeks, it became clear that their approach was working. The number of rats caught in the traps steadily decreased, as did the telltale signs of rodent activity in the house. The overwhelming sense of relief was palpable, as the two friends began to make progress in their shared goal. During the trapping process, Michael discovered an unexpected side effect of their efforts – a profound sense of camaraderie with the forest and its inhabitants. Unexpectedly, Michael found himself captivated by the intricacies and beauty of the ecosystem in his backyard. The sight of deer, raccoons, and other wildlife living harmoniously within their natural habitat seemed to bring a deeper meaning to his existence. With every rat they released back into the wild, Michael felt an ever-increasing connection to the beautiful, vast natural world that existed on the periphery of his life. He began to spend more and more time exploring the woods behind the house, learning the names of the trees and plants that he'd once taken for granted. As Michael delved deeper into the mysteries of the forest, it awakened within him a passion for environmentalism and wildlife conservation that he would carry with him for years to come. Finally, after several months of diligent trapping and releasing, Craig and Michael declared the house rat-free. However, this was not the end of their shared journey. As Craig continued to offer his extermination services to others, Michael's newfound passion for the natural world flourished. He began to volunteer at a local wildlife rehabilitation center, using his spare time to study ecology and environmental science. The friends' shared experience brought them closer than ever and established within them a deep understanding of the delicate balance between humans and the environment. United by their commitment to a compassionate and harmonious existence between mankind and nature, Craig and Michael took pride in knowing that they had played a small but significant part in preserving the beauty and diversity of the natural world for generations to come."},{"question":"Review: Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over.

If there are 75 hogs, what's 5 less than 60% of the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To find the solution, we'll first determine the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom by using the given information about hogs. Then, we'll calculate 60% of the number of cats and finally subtract 5 from that figure. 1. Find the number of cats: Since there are three times as many hogs as cats, we can write this relationship as follows: Number of Hogs = 3 × Number of Cats Given there are 75 hogs, we can now find the number of cats: 75 Hogs = 3 × Number of Cats Number of Cats = 75 Hogs ÷ 3 Number of Cats = 25 2. Calculate 60% of the number of cats: Percentage is calculated by multiplying the given fraction by the number, so 60% of the number of cats: 0.60 × 25 Cats = 15 Cats 3. Subtract 5 from the result obtained in step 2: 5 less than 60% of the number of cats: 15 Cats - 5 = 10 Cats So, 5 less than 60% of the number of cats in King Henry's kingdom is 10 cats."},{"question":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Smith for the following movie plot: In 1607, Pocahontas, the spirited and adventurous daughter of Chief Powhatan, and others from her tribe witness the arrival of three ships sent by English royal charter to found a colony in the New World.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past.

From the very beginning, the film struggles to establish a coherent storyline, leaving audiences confused and disoriented amidst a sea of disjointed scenes. Director John Foster's thinly veiled attempts to integrate magic, fantasy, and drama fall flat as the film's pacing awkwardly staggers between languid exposition and frenzied action sequences. The Forgotten Forest's artificial dialogue lands with a resounding thud, its hollow words devoid of any genuine emotion or wit. Undeniably, the film squanders the potential of an initially intriguing premise - a hidden forest with mystical powers - succumbing to a perplexing mishmash of undercooked ideas that lead nowhere. Aside from its narrative issues, The Forgotten Forest is further mitigated by subpar performances from its woefully miscast ensemble. Lead actor Michael Reeves delivers a wooden and unconvincing portrayal of the protagonist, Alex, leaving much to be desired in terms of emotional depth and believability. Likewise, the supporting cast feels bland and uninspired, leaving audiences hard-pressed to invest in their struggles and triumphs. Moreover, the film's visuals and special effects do little to salvage the overall experience. The forest's supposedly enchanting setting appears artificial and markedly unremarkable, punctuated by moments of laughably amateurish CGI. Even the film's score, composed by the normally reliable Stephen Richards, lacks the necessary gravitas to elevate the story to a more captivating level – ultimately proving to be just another disappointment in a long line of unfulfilled promises. In conclusion, The Forgotten Forest regrettably amounts to a forgettable and uninspiring viewing experience. Hindered by an incoherent plot, flat characters, and uninspired visuals, this movie falls short of providing any semblance of entertainment or emotional impact. Sadly, it serves as a stark reminder that not all forays into a fantastical world can be as enchanting and immersive as one might hope."},{"question":"Article: The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global Seven Years' War (1756–1763) involving France, Britain and the other major European powers.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"To analyze the supposed perturbation, let's break down the process step-by-step and consider the effects of the medicine used to open airways. Step 1: Blood is sent to the liver - The medicine to open airways might cause the heart to pump blood more efficiently, leading to potentially more blood being sent to the liver. However, this increase might not be substantial enough to affect the liver's workload significantly. Step 2: The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The medicine to open airways is not directly involved in liver functions and might not have a direct impact on the liver's use of chemicals and proteins. However, if the medicine is metabolized by the liver, it would slightly increase the liver's workload. Step 3: The blood is cleaned - Opening the airways might improve oxygenation of the blood, which could slightly affect the liver's ability to clean the blood, but this impact may not be very significant. Step 4: Energy is produced - Improved oxygenation of the blood due to opened airways might result in better overall energy production in the body but might not directly correlate to increased workload on the liver. Step 5: The blood leaves the liver cleaned - As long as the liver's functions are not impaired, the blood should still leave the liver cleaned. The medicine to open airways might not have a direct or significant impact on this process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of using medicine to open airways might have a minor indirect effect on the liver's workload, but it is unlikely to cause the liver to work significantly harder.

Every couple of minutes a billboard appears outside the bus window.\\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\"\\"Drink Good'n Wet Root Beer.\\"\\"Fill up with Pacific Gas.\\" Only if you sleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, are you spared the unending cry of \\"You Need It!

Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride.

Bruce Jenner comes out as transgender, says 'I am a woman' NEW YORK (AP) — In the 1970s, Bruce Jenner was a symbol of American masculinity as an Olympic champion. Nearly 40 years later, in an extraordinary television interview, Jenner told the world that he identifies as a woman and has felt gender confusion since he was a little boy growing up in the New York suburbs. Jenner let his hair down — literally loosening a ponytail and letting his hair flow past his shoulders — in a symbolic moment at the start of his two-hour interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that was televised Friday. \\"Yes, for all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\\" For the transgender community, it was a moment as significant as Ellen DeGeneres' coming out as a lesbian was for gays nearly 20 years ago. DeGeneres tweeted support to Jenner, saying the former Olympian was \\"saving lives and opening minds.\\" \\"My whole life has been getting me ready for this,\\" said Jenner, 65, known to a younger generation as the patriarch of television's omnipresent Kardashian clan. \\"It's not just the last few years as they've been treating me as a joke.\\" The interview was filmed in February in Los Angeles and New York, before a fatal car accident in which Jenner was involved. The Nielsen company said an audience of just fewer than 17 million people saw the interview. Jenner said he self-identifies as \\"her,\\" not a specific name. But he told Sawyer he felt comfortable using the pronouns \\"he\\" and \\"him,\\" a designation that is an important issue for many in the transgender community, which believes that transgender people should be referred to by the pronouns with which they choose to identify. Jenner said his \\"brain is more female than it is male.\\" He said he began gender reassignment therapy in the 1980s — taking hormones, having surgery to make his nose smaller and having hair removed from his face and chest — but gave it up. As Jenner got older, he realized that if he got sick and faced death without facing up to this issue, \\"I'd be so mad that I didn't explore that side of my life.\\" As a young boy, Jenner felt an urge to try on his mother's and sister's dresses. \\"I didn't know why I was doing it,\\" he said. \\"It just made me feel good.\\" Jenner said he has never been sexually attracted to men, and he wanted to make clear to viewers that gender identity and sexuality were separate things. \\"I am not gay,\\" he said. \\"I am, as far as I know, heterosexual. I've always been with a woman, raising kids.\\" Jenner said he has not decided whether he will undergo sexual reassignment surgery. \\"These are all things that are out there in the future for me to explore,\\" he said. \\"There's no rush for that. And I would do it so quietly that nobody in the world would know.\\" Jenner's four oldest children appeared on the interview special to support their father, but not the two girls he had with Kris Kardashian. He said his stepdaughter Kim has been a big supporter, urged on by husband Kanye West, but that his stepdaughter Khloe was taking it the hardest. Jenner's first two wives offered messages of support; ABC said Kris Kardashian's publicist called to specifically say his third wife would have no comment. But Kardashian tweeted that no one had asked for comment and, after the interview aired, tweeted: \\"Not only was I able to call him my husband for 25 years and father of my children, I am now able to call him my hero.\\" Jenner told Sawyer that Kris was having a difficult time with it, and that if she better understood it, the couple would probably still be together. Jenner's 89-year-old mother also was interviewed, saying she was more proud of Bruce than when he stood as an Olympic champion in Montreal. The E! Entertainment network announced that Jenner would be part of a documentary series about the transition that would begin airing on July 26. Hollywood offered support. \\"Tonight\\" host Jimmy Fallon, echoing Neil Armstrong when the astronaut took his first steps on the moon, tweeted: \\"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" \\"Today, millions of people learned that someone they know is transgender,\\" said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \\"By sharing this story, Bruce Jenner has shined a light on what it means to be transgender and live authentically in the face of unimaginable public scrutiny. Though Jenner's journey is one that is deeply personal, it is also one that will impact and inspire countless people around the world.\\" Jenner showed Sawyer a closet filled with dresses and men's clothes. Sawyer said she had a private dinner with Jenner where he wore a dress, but the former Olympian did not appear in one in the ABC special. Jenner said his two youngest daughters, suspecting that each other was secretly using her clothes, set up a computer to catch the other in the act — only to find their father using their full-length mirror wearing one of his own dresses. \\"I would like to think that we can save some lives here,\\" said Jenner, who admitted he once considered suicide at a low point when seen by paparazzi heading to a surgery to have his Adam's apple shaved back. \\"I have a feeling this is my cause in life. This is why God put me on this Earth, to deal with this issue.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"In April 2015, former Olympian, Bruce Jenner, publicly came out as transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC News. Bruce, now Caitlyn Jenner, revealed that she had felt gender confusion since her childhood and had self-identified as a woman. During the interview, Jenner discussed her journey and experiences with gender transition, including undergoing gender reassignment therapy in the 1980s. The interview was considered a significant moment in raising awareness and acceptance of the transgender community, similar to Ellen DeGeneres' coming out as a lesbian in 1997."},{"question":"Answer this question: who's hit the most home runs in major league baseball??","response":"The person who has hit the most home runs in Major League Baseball is a man named Barry Bonds.

That's what Barry Bonds did with hitting home runs in baseball."},{"question":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Moccasins are the best option, but a simple flat, brown slip-on shoe would coordinate with the look. Basic brown suede boots would also work as long as they have a flat sole. Fur-lined or fringed boots can add some flair to your costume. If you do not expect to walk through mud puddles, you can also wear moccasin-style slippers. Simple brown sandals could also work as long as they are not embellished with other decorations. Start with a brown cloth headband that wraps around the head rather than over it. Use a hot glue gun to attach one to three feathers to the inside of the headband. Position them so they are at the side of the head and behind the ear. If you cannot find a brown wrap-around headband, cut a strip of stretchy brown fabric that is long enough to fit around the wearer's head and add an extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) to the length. Loop the strip of fabric around to create a band, using fabric glue or hot glue to secure the extra 1-inch (2.5-cm) of fabric over the other end of the band. If you want to give your headband extra flair, decorate it with wooden beads, colorful seed beads, or craft paint. If you want to add a little extra shape to your tunic, tie a braided leather sash around the wearer's waist. If you can’t find a sash or belt without a buckle, cut a strip of brown leather, canvas, or brown rope that is long enough to wrap around the waist. Make sure to cut enough extra material so you can tie the belt into a loose bow at the front of the costume. A fringed leather belt can add an attractive touch to your costume too.

The new Moto 360 has a round face, which is one of two options for Wear devices (square is the other) and features the “Ok Google” voice control highlighted by Google for its new spin-off mobile OS. The hardware features “subtle alerts and notifications,” and Motorola is selling it as a premium, fashion-first advice that uses high-end materials in its construction. It’s coming in a variety of styles as well, and should launch this summer beginning in the U.S. first. Already with just two products officially unveiled, we have a look at a couple of different approaches to how Android Wear OEM partners might differentiate themselves. LG’s G Watch looks focused on being essentially a straightforward notification window, with emphasis on utility, but the Moto 360 seems like it’s designed more with the fashion-savvy crowd in mind, as a way to convince those reluctant to give up their classic, analogue wristwatches to get on board the wearable movement. ||||| The LG G Watch, one of the first wearable devices made in concert with Google, uses the firm's official version of Android for wearable devices. (Courtesy of LG) Google announced Tuesday that it has developed a version of its Android mobile operating system specifically for wearable devices, doubling down on the early efforts in the space that it's already made with its Google Glass headset. The tech giant debuted the new version of the system, Android Wear, in a blog post that explained that the firm is very excited about the future of wearable devices such as smart watches. Wearables \\"understand the context of the world around you, and you can interact with them simply and efficiently, with just a glance or a spoken word,\\" wrote Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai, who oversees the firm's Android, Chrome and Apps division. With Android Wear, Pichai said, Google will cover all types of wearables. But it will start with \\"the most familiar wearable,\\" watches. The watch software, Pichai said, will give consumers the tools to look things up more efficiently, search using their voices, monitor their health and fitness and control other devices such as their phone or television. This is no pie-in-the-sky effort. LG has already announced a product that will run on the new system, the LG G Watch. Apart from a picture, LG hasn't released much information on what the new watch will do. But it promises more details in the \\"coming months.\\" \\"The opportunity to work with Google on LG G Watch was the perfect chance for LG to really pull out all stops in both design and engineering,” said Jong-seok Park, president and chief executive of LG Electronics Mobile Communications. “We’re confident that a well-designed device has the potential to take the smart wearable market by storm.\\" Google's announcement opens the floodgates for manufacturers to work with the company to build wearable devices with software that actually makes sense, rather than having to invest the time and energy on their own. By pushing a familiar platform like Android to wearable devices, one analyst said, Google makes it easy for the rosters of talented Android and Java developers to jump onto the new platform. \\"This is one reason we saw Android apps increase at a rapid pace, and it is why we are likely to see the same happen with wearables,\\" said Al Hilwa, program director of software development research at IDC. \\"Allowing programmers to build such apps with some degree of expediency is what the Android [software developers kit] will be all about!\\" It also means that time is tick, tick, ticking on for Apple to release its own version of a wearable device, a much-awaited and anticipated device that tech bloggers have nicknamed the \\"iWatch.\\" Apple hasn't officially confirmed anything about a move into wearables, though Apple chief executive Tim Cook did say once that the firm finds wearables, and the wrist, \\"interesting. While Apple is notorious for not wanting to release products until they're perfect -- even if it means coming into an industry late -- Hilwa said that any announcement that could potentially expand the Android ecosystem this much should spur some movement in Cupertino. \\"I would expect this to matter a lot to Apple because, no matter their high-end, they are in an ecosystem battle with Android,\\" he said. \\"Apple can make a few amazing devices, and likely they will be big hits. But what Android Wear will stimulate is hundreds if not thousands of devices in addition to apps on top of them.\\" Curious for more about what Google has in store for the wearables space? Here's how the company itself frames that vision: ||||| An employee answers phone calls at the switchboard of the Google office in Zurich August 18, 2009. A Moto 360 smartwatch is seen in this Motorola Mobility LLC handout image released to Reuters on March 18, 2014. SAN FRANCISCO Voice-controlled smartwatches that track heart rates and connect to phones and tablets will debut later this year as Google Inc partners with electronics, technology and fashion companies to take consumers to the next promised frontier in computing. Google on Tuesday unveiled plans to help develop the watches and other wearable computers based on its Android mobile operating system, which already runs more than three out of four smartphones sold worldwide. The Android Wear project is open to software makers to create apps for the watches, putting Google at the forefront of efforts to jumpstart the nascent wearable computing market. The news comes as speculation swirls around iPhone-maker Apple Inc's plans for wearable computers, including a smartwatch of its own. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has promised new \\"product categories\\" later this year. A video posted on Google's blog on Tuesday showed people speaking into their watches to check sports scores, control music, send replies to text messages and even open their home garages. By aligning itself with a broad spectrum of partners to develop the smartwatches, Google is hoping to replicate the success that helped make its free Android software the most popular smartphone operating system, analysts said. LG Electronics said on Tuesday it would introduce its first Android watch, the G Watch, in the second quarter. Motorola said its Moto 360 Android watch would be available this summer. Fossil Group Inc, which makes watches, handbags and other accessories, also announced that it was working with Google on Android devices. Many believe wearable computers represent the next big shift in technology, just as smartphones evolved from personal computers, but efforts by various companies so far have had mixed results. Samsung was among the first to sell a smartwatch for consumers, but its maiden effort, the Galaxy Gear, was widely panned by reviewers. Google's announcement \\"definitely gives wearables a status that it's a market in its own right and it needs to be treated with the respect that a separate operating system branch gives it,\\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Kantar World Panel. FITNESS TRACKERS Android smartwatches will connect wirelessly to a mobile phone and can be outfitted with a variety of sensors, Google said. That means that apps developed for Android watches will be able to monitor fitness and health information such as a wearer's heart rate or distance jogged. Google released an Android Wear Developer Preview on Tuesday, saying it would allow software makers to begin creating specialized apps for the watches. Google has also been developing Google Glass, a small stamp-sized screen attached to a pair of eyeglass frames. Google Glass can record video, access email, provide turn-by-turn driving directions and retrieve info from the Web by connecting wirelessly to a user's cell phone, but it has also raised concerns ranging from privacy intrusions to distracted driving. Smartwatches have a better chance of catching on with the general public than Google Glass, said Ramon Llamas, an analyst with industry research firm IDC. \\"It's a really cool idea, but there's something that creeps people out about it,\\" Llamas said of Google Glass. The success of smartwatches will depend on the device's price, battery life and the appeal of the watches' designs, he said. Motorola said it would share more details about its forthcoming Moto 360 smartwatch when it holds a special online press conference on Wednesday. Google recently announced plans to sell its Motorola business to Chinese PC-maker Lenovo Group Ltd. Juniper Research expects more than 130 million smart wearable devices will ship by 2018. Moreover, global shipments of wearable \\"smart glasses\\" alone will reach 10 million each year by 2018, compared with an estimated 87,000 in 2013, according to the research firm. MUST HAVE OR NICE TO HAVE? Google, whose projects range from self-driving cars to robots, likely sees smartwatches as part of the future evolution of computing, said Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler. But he said it remained to be seen whether smartwatches will become an indispensable digital accessory or a \\"nice-to-have\\" gadget. \\"At this point I would still view it as a niche product,\\" he said. Among the more than 10 companies that are partnering with Google on Android watches are Samsung Electronics Co, HTC Corp, Asustek Computer Inc, Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Broadcom Corp and Mediatek Inc. Qualcomm and its manufacturing customers are working on \\"multiple\\" wearable devices based on its Snapdragon processors, spokesman Jon Carvill said. He declined to elaborate. \\"We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with mobile technology,\\" Google said in a post on its official blog on Tuesday. \\"That's why we're so excited about wearables — they understand the context of the world around you, and you can interact with them simply and efficiently, with just a glance or a spoken word.\\" Shares of Google closed 1.6 percent higher at 1,211.22 on Tuesday. Shares of Fossil Group rose 4.6 percent to 118.04.

Then Oscar (Allan Edwall), father of Alexander (Bertil Guve) who might be 11 and Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) who might be 7, dies.In act two, Oscar appears to his children. Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then he locks up the boy.In act three, Isak (Erland Josephson), a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house (in the chest!). During this escape, the ghosts of his former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad) whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated step-father.In the final act, mother (Ewa Fröling) and children are back in the warm comfort of their extended family's house. Gustav (Jarl Kulle), the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which he summarizes the play. Without mentioning ghosts explicitly, he says there are things we know and should enjoy, such as food and dance, and many more aspects of life of which we are ignorant.

Jay Z, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and the Foo Fighters were ­headlining nearby concerts, and Times Square had been renamed \\"Super Bowl Boulevard.\\" Amid the fanfare, Alicia Glen -- a former Goldman Sachs executive who had just become a deputy mayor with the then-new administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio -- attended NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's annual pregame Super Bowl party at the Museum of Natural History. There, she was approached by Jonathan Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants and co-chairman of the board of Loews Corp. \\"You see how great these events are for the city?\\" Tisch asked. \\"Why don't we team up to bring the Grammys back to New York?\\" Three years later, according to multiple sources close to the ­negotiations, the Grammys are indeed set to return to New York's Madison Square Garden -- for just the second time in 17 years -- for the show's 60th anniversary in 2018. The deal is all but done, city sources say, and a formal announcement will be made after this year's ceremony. But sources close to the situation tell Billboard that after that New York sojourn, the Grammys will return to the Staples Center in 2019, as part of a multi-year extension of its most recent agreement. After all, the Grammys have developed a cozy relationship with their Los Angeles base, particularly the awards-show-friendly Staples Center. While the ceremony ­essentially traded off between L.A. and New York for its first three decades, that ended in the late 1990s after a very public spat between then-New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Recording Academy chief Michael Greene, which spiraled into threats and insults after Greene refused to allow Hizzoner to read the list of nominees at a news ­conference promoting the awards show. \\"If they want to go back to L.A., they can,\\" said Giuliani in 1998. \\"We could replace the Grammys in about a day.\\" But by 2014, New York wanted them back. The Grammys bring an estimated 82 million bump to its host city's economy, according to a report from the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board; the mayor's office says the total could be as much as 200 million in ancillary ­spending. That summer, Tisch ­introduced Glen to Recording Academy CEO Neil Portnow. The Grammys' agreement with Staples was up for renewal in 2017, and native New Yorker Portnow was interested. But discussions lay dormant as de Blasio became ensnared in a series of investigations into his fund-raising, which left City Hall reluctant to ask would-be donors for contributions. The calculus changed at the start of 2016, when Julie Menin, a longtime civic activist who worked to revitalize Lower Manhattan in the years after 9/11, was named to head the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment; just as she was appointed, her ­department's purview grew from film and TV to include a number of other creative industries, especially music. In February, Menin flew to L.A. to meet with The Recording Academy. According to sources familiar with the negotiation, the academy balked, mostly because a show in New York would require an additional 6.5 million in costs due to increased production, labor and venue expenses. City Hall declined to offer up funds, so Menin set about raising the money from private ­interests, enlisting Related Companies, a major real estate developer in the city, to invest, along with Spotify, ­consulting company Accenture and the Partnership for New York City; she also negotiated with labor unions for concessions on costs. Not every union was ­willing, however, so final costs ended up rising to 8 million, ­according to a source -- a figure Menin promptly matched by a new round of solicitation. \\"She came to us looking for some help, and we did our best to ­accommodate,\\" says James Claffey, president of Local 1, the stagehands union for MSG. Claffey offered flexibility on call times and meal times that the Grammys sought. \\"Honestly, I did not think Julie would pull it off,\\" he adds. \\"She was remarkable.\\" The toughest knot of all, however, was the venue and its executive chairman James Dolan. The Grammys require the arena to remain dark for nearly two weeks as the set is built and taken down. \\"It's a pain in the ass for them,\\" one person involved in the ­negotiation tells Billboard. \\"It's a money loser.\\" Another source says Dolan declined to meet with de Blasio or New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, since the ­latter two have a long-running feud and Dolan did not want to get involved. But Irving Azoff, Dolan's business partner in Azoff-MSG Entertainment, had been in touch with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman -- a neutral party in the feud -- who reassured Dolan and Portnow that the city and state would adhere to whatever was agreed to, says a source. MSG also requested that the Grammys be presented \\"in the round,\\" which would allow it to sell more luxury suites and help make up the ­financial shortfall for the remaining 11 dark days. Why was the venue so ­cooperative? Not ­coincidentally, Azoff-MSGE also runs the Staples Center's fiercest ­competitor: The Forum. (Representatives for The Recording Academy, Azoff, MSG, Staples Center owner AEG and City Hall declined requests for comment.) All seemed positive until the eve of a get-to-know-each-other dinner with the stakeholders -- representatives from MSG, Tisch, Claffey, Menin, Portnow, the CEO of the corporate sponsors on the host committee and reps for the academy -- when The New York Times reported the Grammys would be returning to New York. \\"It put a bit of a strain on the dinner,\\" says one attendee. While reps for the academy and the city declined to comment beyond statements like Menin's to Billboard -- \\"We're having ­productive ­conversations\\" -- and sources close to the academy insist the deal is not final, the Grammys are ­conspicuously doubling down on their presence in New York. In December, the academy purchased a 13.5 million Manhattan townhouse to serve as a new local headquarters; on Feb. 7, it announced the ­opening of the first East Coast Grammy Museum at the Prudential Center in nearby Newark, N.J.; and on Jan. 30, Menin was a featured speaker at a Grammy reception for New York nominees at the Standard Hotel. Even if, as multiple sources confirm, the Grammys are held in New York next year, a longer-term ­arrangement may take more fund-raising and finagling in light of the Academy's deal to return to Staples in 2019. Still, says one source, \\"More than just a one-off is everyone's hope.\\" Additional reporting by Jem Aswad A version of this article originally appeared in the Feb. 18 issue of Billboard. ||||| Archive-It Partner 1067: The Political TV Ad Archive, a project of the Internet Archive, collects political TV ads and social media sites in key 2016 primary election states, unlocking the metadata underneath and highlighting quality journalism to provide journalists, civic organizations, academics, and the general public with reliable information on who is trying to influence them & how. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The 59th annual Grammy Awards took place, with Adele winning five awards, including Album of the Year for \\"25\\" and Record and Song of the Year for \\"Hello\\".

Plot title: The Ruins Movie plot: Two young American couples â Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) â enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

How shall I convince you to consider Haskell as official language in OpenAI? What are some good projects to learn Haskell language?","response":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions are related to the Haskell programming language, they address different aspects and goals. Question 1: How shall I convince you to consider Haskell as an official language in OpenAI? This question aims to gather information and arguments that could be used to persuade someone (in this case, most likely OpenAI) to consider Haskell as an official language for their projects. The focus here is on the reasons and benefits that Haskell could bring to the organization and why it should be adopted as an official language. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing an outline of: 1. Haskell's unique features and advantages: - Purely functional programming: Emphasizes immutability and the absence of side effects, which helps create clean, modular, and maintainable code. - Strong static typing: Helps catch many errors during the compilation process and prevents a wide range of runtime errors, improving code reliability. - Lazy evaluation: Allows for efficient, high-level programming abstractions by evaluating expressions only when necessary. - Concurrency and parallelism support: Provides lightweight threads and synchronization primitives that make Haskell a suitable choice for concurrent and parallel programming tasks. 2. Success stories of organizations and projects using Haskell: - Companies like Facebook, Standard Chartered Bank, and Galois have successfully adopted Haskell for their projects. - Open-source projects such as Cardano, a decentralized cryptocurrency platform, and Pandoc, a universal document converter, employ Haskell for critical components. 3. The growing Haskell community and ecosystem: - Numerous libraries and tools, such as Stack and Cabal for package management, Hackage as a package repository, and frameworks like Yesod for web development, are available to Haskell developers. - There are numerous events and meetups, such as the Haskell eXchange conference and ZuriHac, dedicated to learning, discussing, and promoting Haskell. - Online resources like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good and Haskell School of Music provide high-quality educational materials for learning Haskell. Question 2: What are some good projects to learn the Haskell language? This question focuses on exploring potential projects that can help someone learn the Haskell programming language. The aim here is to provide ideas and suggestions for hands-on practical experience to learn and practice Haskell effectively. A detailed and long answer for this question would involve providing a list of suggested project ideas, such as: 1. Command-line utilities: - Implement common Unix utilities like \\"grep,\\" \\"cat,\\" or \\"wc\\" in Haskell to understand basic syntax, data structures, and IO operations. 2. Functional data structures: - Implement classic data structures (for example, stacks, queues, and trees) using functional programming concepts to grasp the basic principles of Haskell. 3. Web applications: - Use a web development framework such as Yesod to create a simple web application, such as a blog or a to-do list app. 4. Parser combinators: - Write a parser for a programming language or markup format (e.g., JSON, XML, or a simple calculator language) using parser combinators to get acquainted with the world of monads and applicative functors. 5. Implement a simple game: - Create a text-based or a simple graphical game using the Gloss or SDL library to understand the interaction between functional programming and realtime systems. 6. A Projects Euler solver: - Solve math problems from the Project Euler website using Haskell's expressive and concise syntax to boost your problem-solving skills using functional concepts. These two questions serve distinct purposes - one focusing on advocating for Haskell's adoption in an organization and the other on providing project ideas for learning Haskell. While they are both related to Haskell, the inquiries target separate aspects of the language and its usage, and thus, they do not have the same meaning."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation in Italian and you have to find its answer. The operations 'addition' and 'subtraction' have been replaced with their italian translations i.e you need to perform addition when you see 'aggiunta' and subtraction in case of 'sottrazione'. Q: 2779 aggiunta 4009 sottrazione 3483 sottrazione 2614 sottrazione 1960 sottrazione 4254 A:","response":"To find the answer, we will complete the operation step-by-step from left to right, using the Italian words for addition ('aggiunta') and subtraction ('sottrazione'). Starting from the left, you have: 1. '2779 aggiunta 4009' translates to '2779 plus 4009'. Adding 2779 and 4009 leads to 6788. 2. Then, '6788 sottrazione 3483' translates to '6788 minus 3483'. Subtracting 3483 from 6788 leaves a remainder of 3305. 3. Moving on, '3305 sottrazione 2614' becomes '3305 minus 2614'. This gives us 691. 4. To that, we apply '691 sottrazione 1960' or '691 minus 1960'. Since 1960 is greater than 691, the result will be a negative value: -1269. 5. Finally, '-1269 sottrazione 4254' means '-1269 minus 4254'. Again, since 4254 is greater than 1269 (even if 1269 is negative), the result is a more negative value: -5523.

Chain of thought:","response":"1. In order to determine if a newborn can look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant, first, we need to find out the average height of a fully grown horseradish plant. 2. According to multiple sources, a mature horseradish plant can grow to be around 24 inches (or 60 centimeters) tall. 3. Next, we need to determine the height of a newborn's eyes when they are held or placed in a position where they could potentially see over the plant. 4. The average height of a newborn baby is about 20 inches (or 50 centimeters) tall. However, we need to subtract the height from the eyes to the top of the head in order to find the height of a newborn's eyes from the ground. 5. An approximate estimate is that the distance from the eyes to the top of the head on a newborn baby is about 2 inches (or 5 centimeters). This estimation could vary depending on factors such as the infant's head size and shape. 6. Subtracting this estimate from the total height of the baby, we arrive at approximately 18 inches (or 45 centimeters) as the height of a newborn's eyes from the ground. 7. Comparing this height to the mature horseradish plant's height of 24 inches (or 60 centimeters), we can conclude that a newborn's eyes would be approximately 6 inches (or 15 centimeters) shorter than the top of a fully grown horseradish plant. 8. Based on this information, a newborn would not be able to look over the top of a fully grown horseradish plant, as their eyes would be significantly lower in height than the top of the plant."},{"question":"Yani resmi düzeydeki bu ayrımcılık, toplumsal düzeyde de bir etki yaratıyor.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What action by Francis Drake, made the 1386 Treaty of Windsor a distant memory?\\" is \\"Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a âlegitimate targetâ as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator\\"?","response":"Yes, that's right! Francis Drake attacked the Algarve and sacked Sagres, which made the 1386 Treaty of Windsor a distant memory. The Treaty was about friendship between Britain and Portugal, but because Portugal was under Spanish rule, it became a target for British attacks."},{"question":"Between the third and fourth sessions the pope announced reforms in the areas of Roman Curia, revision of Canon Law, regulations for mixed marriages involving several faiths, and birth control issues. He opened the final session of the council, concelebrating with bishops from countries where the Church was persecuted. Several texts proposed for his approval had to be changed. But all texts were finally agreed upon. The Council was concluded on 8 December 1965, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What does the Catholic church considered \\"mixed\\" in a \\"mixed marriage\\"?","response":"A \\"mixed marriage\\" in the context of the Catholic Church refers to a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic individual. The non-Catholic partner can be a baptized Christian from another denomination, or a non-Christian (someone who follows other religions or has no religious affiliation). The Catholic Church has guidelines and regulations for mixed marriages to ensure that the religious beliefs of both parties are respected, and the Catholic partner remains loyal and supportive of the Catholic faith. In the past, the Catholic Church showed greater caution and concern regarding mixed marriages due to the potential risks in upholding and preserving the Catholic faith within such relationships. This concern stems from the challenges that could arise from differences in religious beliefs and practices, which might complicate the couple's commitment to raising their children in the Catholic tradition. Therefore, the Church has always preferred marriages between Catholics. However, the Church, recognizing the complex and diverse nature of modern society, allows mixed marriages under specific conditions. According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 1124 declares that mixed marriages cannot take place without the necessary permission from the local ordinary, usually the bishop. The Catholic partner must obtain this permission, acknowledging their responsibility to preserve their faith and do all within their power to have their children baptized and raised as Catholics. The non-Catholic partner must be informed of these promises and intentions, and the Church emphasizes the importance of the couple's mutual respect for each other's beliefs. During the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the Church discussed the need for a more pastoral approach to mixed marriages. In the reforms announced by Pope Paul VI, the Church acknowledged the need to revise regulations surrounding mixed marriages to address the challenges faced by couples in interfaith relationships. This revision sought to promote better understanding, respect, and cooperation between the Catholic Church and other Christian communities and non-Christian religions. In summary, the Catholic Church considers a marriage \\"mixed\\" when it involves a Catholic and a non-Catholic partner. The Church has regulations and guidelines in place to maintain the integrity of the Catholic faith within such marriages, but it also fosters a more pastoral and understanding approach to the diverse and complex nature of modern relationships."},{"question":"Premise: \\"A man in a red sweatshirt standing next to a bike and a two mailboxes.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The man has a bike.\\" is true?

On 17 January 1979, the Shah left the country (ostensibly \\"on vacation\\"), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd estimated (by BBC) to be of up to five million people. On his chartered Air France flight back to Tehran 120 journalists accompanied him, including three women. One of the journalists, Peter Jennings, asked: \\"Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?\\" Khomeini answered via his aide Sadegh Ghotbzadeh: \\"Hichi\\" (Nothing). This statement--much discussed at the time and since--was considered by some reflective of his mystical beliefs and non-attachment to ego. Others considered it a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a \\"mainstream nationalist leader\\" that they were in for disappointment. To others, it was a reflection of an unfeeling leader incapable or unconcerned with understanding the thoughts, beliefs, or the needs of the Iranian populace. Khomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar, promising \\"I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government.\\" On 11 February (Bahman 22), Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, demanding, \\"since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed.\\" It was \\"God's government,\\" he warned, disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a \\"revolt against God.\\" As Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender.

This translation maintains the context and sentiment of the original phrase. Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Dianne's Advice\\" is translated to \\"Les conseils de Dianne.\\" In French, \\"les conseils\\" means \\"advice,\\" and \\"de\\" signifies possession, so the phrase becomes \\"the advice of Dianne.\\" 2. \\"A long time ago\\" is translated to \\"Il y a longtemps.\\" In French, \\"il y a\\" means \\"there is\\" or \\"there are,\\" and \\"longtemps\\" means \\"a long time.\\" Together, this phrase indicates that something happened in the distant past. 3. \\"Someone\\" is translated to \\"quelqu'un,\\" which is a singular, non-gendered term for a person in French. 4. \\"Told me\\" is translated to \\"m'a dit.\\" In this context, \\"m'\\" is used as a contraction for \\"me\\" in French, which means \\"to me.\\" \\"Dit\\" is the past participle of the verb \\"dire,\\" which means \\"to say\\" or \\"to tell.\\" 5. \\"Do what you love\\" is translated to \\"Fais ce que tu aimes.\\" Here, \\"fais\\" is the imperative form of \\"faire,\\" which means \\"to do.\\" \\"Ce que\\" is a relative pronoun that means \\"what\\" in English, and \\"tu aimes\\" means \\"you love\\" in French. 6. \\"Never give up\\" is translated to \\"n'abandonne jamais.\\" In French, \\"n'abandonne\\" is the negation (indicated by the \\"n'\\") of the imperative form of \\"abandonner,\\" which means \\"to give up.\\" Finally, \\"jamais\\" means \\"never\\" in this context."},{"question":"What is the solution to this math problem?

You have 4 more cookies, and you can take some away (-u) to reach 2650500 toys. To find out how many toys to take away, we can follow these steps: 1. Subtract 2650496 from 2650500: 2650500 - 2650496 = 4 2. Since we are taking away toys, the value of \\"u\\" should be negative. So, u = -4 We found that u = -4. That means if we take away 4 toys from 2650496, we will get 2650500."},{"question":"Choices: I. negative. II. positive.

Here's an example of a positive review following these steps: \\"Last night, my family and I had the pleasure of dining at La Bella Italia, a new Italian restaurant in town. The experience exceeded all our expectations! From the moment we entered, we were greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere, beautifully decorated with rustic Italian charm. The menu offered a wide selection of delicious Italian dishes, and we were thrilled with our choices. The Caprese salad's flavors were spot-on - fresh tomatoes and basil, paired with creamy buffalo mozzarella, truly represented the essence of Italy. As for the pasta dishes, the Linguine alla Scoglio was a show stopper - perfectly cooked pasta loaded with fresh, succulent seafood. The service also deserves praise! Our server, Marco, was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. He offered recommendations and helped us find the perfect wine to pair with our meal. If I had to critique anything, I'd say the only downside was that the tables were a bit cramped, but it didn't affect our overall dining experience. We ended our meal with delightful Tiramisu and left with smiles on our faces. La Bella Italia is a fantastic addition to our city's food scene, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine with unbeatable service!\\" This review gives a positive account of the user's experience while visiting La Bella Italia, detailing what they enjoyed most and providing an honest and balanced perspective."},{"question":"The only birdie putt Mike Weir made yesterday in the Canadian Open came at a good time, a 6-footer on the 18th hole that gave him a three-shot lead and left him What is a good title for this?","response":"Step 1: Identify the main elements of the information given - In this piece of information, the main elements are \\"birdie putt\\", \\"Mike Weir\\", \\"Canadian Open\\", \\"6-footer on the 18th hole\\", \\"three-shot lead\\", and \\"good timing\\".

The 25-year-old dominated world number three Radwanska with some stunning returns and powerful hitting, and she convincingly won the second set. Konta finished the match off with an ace to claim her second WTA tour title. And Britain could yet boast both the women's and men's champions in Sydney, with Dan Evans defeating Andrey Kuznetsov to reach his first ATP Tour final, while Jamie Murray is in the doubles final. Konta, playing in the city of her birth, did not drop a set all week as she marched through a high-class field. \\"I was born here, so this is a very special moment for me,\\" Konta said. \\"I'm really happy.\\" \\"I'm really pleased with the amount of matches I've been able to play.

Konta had been beaten in both her previous matches against Radwanska, including the China Open final, and lost the first six points of the match. But, from 0-30 down on her own serve in the second game, Konta quickly turned the match around and took her third break point in the third game of match to seize the initiative. Her highlights in the first set included a second serve ace and some heavy hitting before a service game to love to wrap it up. Konta twice broke Radwanska at the start of the second set to go 4-0 up and she finished off proceedings with her seventh ace to secure victory in one hour and 21 minutes. \\"I can't remember playing someone like this on that level, that consistent for the whole match,\\" Radwanska said. \\"I couldn't really say that I did something wrong.

Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore.

However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper. Ray Reardon became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with John Spencer (snooker player) winning three. Steve Davis first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999).

Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985.

But try telling that to someone trying to Instagram their brunch without getting egg yolk all over their phone. The avocado has been done to death this year – along with articles about the avocado being done to death. An irony I am well aware of. This torrent of publicity for what is basically a delicious thing to eat, followed by a fierce backlash, is inexplicable if you’ve been quietly eating avocados for years. Related: Ripe and ready: how ‘evil geniuses’ got us hooked on avocados Let’s look at the positives. In many ways, the rise of the avocado in 2015 has been a welcome development. There are more of them around, for a start, and some of them are even ripe. You can get avocado on toast in places that aren’t London. I know, because I live somewhere that is not London. And when it comes to food trends, you know something’s gone mainstream when it rocks up in my town. But there are drawbacks too. Apparently, avocados were the most pinned food on Pinterest this year. Just writing that sentence makes me hate humanity. The ludicrous idea that they’re a butter substitute emerged. See “brownies” made from avocados, apple sauce and coconut flour. And we saw the advent of avocado tattoos. You really have seen it all when you’ve seen someone sporting a tattoo of a haunted avocado. All these things and, of course, the final straw – Nigella Lawson’s championing of avocado on toast on Simply Nigella. I love Nigella. I love avocados. But although her avocado on toast contains dill (no), lime, chilli flakes and radish, avocado on toast is most definitely not a recipe. Even Nigella had to admit this. But unfortunately she added that avocado on toast was “part of the fabric of my life”. There are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016 People just sick to death of the whole thing (the whole enchilada, if you will – a dish, of course, that is perfect with avocado) have suggested that the smug and ubiquitous avocado should be left behind in 2015. But rather than turn our backs on this delectable food, how about we simply enjoy avocados and stop plastering pictures of them all over social media? After all, there are plenty of contenders for trendy foods we can all become incredibly annoyed by in 2016: Drinking vinegars with a venerable history. Shrubs are more delicious than they sound, but have inexplicably started appearing in hipster hangouts in New York and London – see the Shrub and Shutter restaurant in Brixton. Homemade of course. And peanuts simply won’t do. Almonds. Cashews. Pecans. The more expensive the better. You will fall into ruinous penury and break your blender trying to make this at home. And then you will go to the supermarket and buy a jar of Sun-Pat. Slimy in its raw state, brittle in its packaged, dried form, quickly turning limp. Umami. Already in Marks & Spencer biscuits. What do you do with it? No one knows. But you’ll buy it anyway. Fermented tea drink people say tastes fantastic. They are lying. Health benefits, apparently. Kombucha tea bars are “popping up” at places such as Mick’s Garage in Hackney, London, says the trendiest food blogger in the world, Clerkenwell Boy. I’m so untrendy I thought that might be an actual garage. So I Googled it. Then I had a little cry. The good news is that said bar offers it as a mixer for spirits. And if there’s one thing that’s comfortingly impervious to aggravating food trends, it’s good old hard liquor. Cheers.

These protests are in direct response to the mounting issue of funding cuts, which students and faculty alike believe have hampered the quality of education and services provided at their institutions. Step 1: Understand the issue The main source of discontent stems from the drastic budget cuts to higher education made by both federal and state governments over the past few years. As a result, colleges and universities have been forced to adjust their budgets, often at the expense of essential programs, services, and support staff. This has led to students and faculty members experiencing increased financial pressure, decreased resources, and limited opportunities. Step 2: Research and gather information Various public sources have reported that funding for higher education has been on a steady decline in the US. This is especially alarming as it comes at a time when college tuition continues to rise, student debt has escalated, and a greater emphasis is being placed on the importance of higher education for future success. Step 3: Highlight the impact of funding cuts The consequences of reduced funding are manifold: colleges and universities have to grapple with minimized support for research, infrastructure, and student services. Additionally, many educational institutions have been forced to implement hiring freezes, furlough faculty and staff members, and even cancel or postpone academic programs. Step 4: Describe the protests and what they aim to achieve In response to these adverse effects, students, faculty, and staff have started organizing and participating in raucous protests on their campuses. Their main objective is to oppose these funding cuts and bring attention to the deteriorating state of the American higher education system. Protesters hope that their actions will prompt a reevaluation of budgeting priorities, with the goal of reestablishing financial security for colleges and universities. Step 5: Address the potential outcomes of the protests While it is challenging to predict the precise outcomes of these rowdy demonstrations, the sheer number and intensity of the protesters cannot be ignored. It is possible that the public outcry will push policymakers to rethink their funding strategies and reconsider the importance of investing in higher education for both individual and societal prosperity. In conclusion, the recent surge of rowdy protests at US campuses offers a glimpse into the frustrations and concerns faced by those directly affected by the funding cuts in higher education. As the battle for resources and support continues, it remains to be seen whether these demonstrations will bring about the desired change and secure a brighter future for students, educators, and institutions alike."},{"question":"Question.

The title indicates that the story is about having fun during the summer, and the first four sentences describe John and Jackie's excitement for summer and their desire to spend time at the beach or pool, but plans are challenged by unexpected events like beach closure and rain. Now, I analyze the given choices for the last sentence: a. Elly suggested a bus instead, and they loved their careless road trip. b. Already in their bathing suits, the family played in the rain instead. I compare the two choices with the given context, and notice that: • Choice ‘a’ introduces a new character 'Elly' who was not mentioned before in the story, and the bus/road trip idea seems disconnected from the story's theme and development so far. • Choice ‘b’ connects back to the beginning of the story, where John, Jackie, and their mom are excited for summer fun. This choice presents a coherent resolution by having the family play in the rain while wearing their bathing suits, which aligns with the \\"Summer Fun\\" theme. Considering the coherence of the story, I choose option 'b' as the fifth sentence of the story, since it seamlessly connects to the rest of the narrative and makes more sense."},{"question":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer. Rationale: Not all men on a street with a green red and yellow flag wrapped around him and a cap on his head is part of a protest. The question and answer:","response":"Question: How can you determine if someone is participating in a protest or simply showing their support for a cause? Answer: To determine whether someone is actively participating in a protest or just showing their support for a cause, consider the following: 1. Location: A person participating in a protest would typically be within the vicinity where the event is taking place. Look for street closures, barricades, or police presence near the area. 2. Group behavior: People participating in the protest are more likely to be engaging in activities associated with the protest, like chanting, marching, carrying signs, or interacting with other protesters. If the individual is actively engaged in these activities, it's more likely they are part of the protest. 3. Context: Consider the context of the situation. If there is a known protest happening nearby, the person could be part of the protest just by being in the area and displaying supportive items, such as flags or headwear. On the other hand, if there are no known protests occurring and the person is simply going about their day or socializing with others, it is less likely that they are part of a protest. 4. Communication: If possible, respectfully ask the person if they are part of the protest or just showing support for the cause. They can clarify their intentions, and you can gain more insight into the situation. In summary, determining whether someone is participating in a protest or merely showing their support for a cause requires you to consider factors such as location, group behavior, context, and communication. By evaluating these factors, you can form a clearer understanding of the individual's involvement in the event."},{"question":"Question: who founded the American Red Cross?

(b). positive.).","response":"(a). Negative Yelp Review: Title: Disappointing Experience at the Hypothetical Café I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience at the Hypothetical Café has compelled me to share my disappointment. Being a popular spot in town, my expectations were high; however, the café failed to meet those standards on multiple levels, from the food and drinks to the service and atmosphere. Upon walking into the café, I immediately noticed the chipped and worn furniture and the overly cramped seating arrangement. The lack of attention to the café's ambiance was a red flag, but my friends and I still chose to give it a try. As we glanced over the menu, we initially found it quite extensive, offering a wide range of both sweet and savory options. Unfortunately, this excitement would not last long. After placing our orders, we started to experience issues with the service and staff. Our waiter took forever to bring our drinks and appeared disinterested, bordering on rude, when we tried to clarify a missing item. Furthermore, the regular water we'd requested showed up lukewarm, which was far from refreshing, and the coffee served to someone in my party tasted watered-down and almost stale. Moving on to the food, which was supposed to be the saving grace of this place. After waiting over 30 minutes for our orders to arrive, we were more than ready to dig in. One friend ordered Eggs Benedict and another chose the shrimp and avocado toast, while I opted for the highly recommended Hypothetical Burger. The Eggs Benedict was overcooked and dry, with a poorly seasoned hollandaise sauce. The shrimp and avocado toast was a disaster – the shrimp tasted as if it had been thawed improperly and the avocado was overly mashed with an off-putting texture. As for the Hypothetical Burger, I must say I was extremely let down. The burger was greasy and served on a soggy bun that fell apart halfway through eating it. The fries accompanying my meal were limp and could have used a second round in the fryer, and the coleslaw was drowning in dressing, rendering it far too rich to consume. I did address my concerns with the staff and management, but the response received was underwhelming and dismissive. To add insult to injury, the bill took a considerable amount of time to arrive and had errors, which required further waiting to sort out. In conclusion, the Hypothetical Café has left a poor taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. As someone who truly appreciates good dining experiences and values customer service, I regret to say that I won't be returning to this establishment. It saddens me to write such a negative review, but I feel it's important to share my experience in the hope that improvements can be made."},{"question":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I ordered this and several other DVD's for my Massage business.

Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - Theodoric I ( Gothic : Þiudareiks ; German : Theodorid or Theodorich ; Latin : Theodericus ) , ( c. 393 -- 20 June 451 ) called in Spanish , Portuguese and Italian Teodorico , was the Germanic King of the Visigoths from 418 to 451 AD . An illegitimate son of Alaric , Theodoric is famous for his part in defeating Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 , where he was killed . - The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), also called the Battle of Châlons or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD between a coalition led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. It was one of the last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic foederati composed the majority of the coalition army. The battle was strategically inconclusive: the Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul, and installed Merovech as king of the Franks. However, the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. The Hunnic Empire was later dismantled by a coalition of their Germanic vassals at the Battle of Nedao in 454. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Alaric I (- \\"supreme chief/ruler\\" 370 (or 375)410 AD) was the first King of the Visigoths from 395410, son (or paternal grandson) of chieftain Rothestes. Alaric is best known for his sack of Rome in 410, which marked a decisive event in the decline of the Roman Empire. - The Goths were an East Germanic people, two of whose branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths, played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of Medieval Europe. The Goths dominated a vast area, which at its peak under the Germanic king Ermanaric and his sub-king Athanaric possibly extended all the way from the Danube to the Don, and from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. - Attila (or ; fl. circa 406453), frequently referred to as Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in March 453. Attila was a leader of the Hunnic Empire, a tribal confederation consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, and Alans among others, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - Merovech (Latin: \\"Meroveus\\" or \\"Merovius\\"; died 453/457) is the semi-legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty of the Salian Franks (although Chlodio may in fact be the founder), which later became the dominant Frankish tribe. His name is close to \\"Marwig\\", lit. \\"famed fight\\" (compare modern Dutch \\"mare\\" \\"news, rumour\\" and \\"vermaard\\" \\"famous\\"). He is said to be one of several barbarian warlords and kings that joined forces with the Roman general Aetius against the Huns under Attila on the Catalaunian fields in Gaul. The first Frankish royal dynasty called themselves Merovingians (\\"descendants of Meroveus\\") after him, although no other historical evidence exists that Merovech ever lived.

It wasn't every day that one would receive such a unique and personal present, and it was clear that Laura had put a great deal of time and effort into finding the perfect aquarium for their shared living space. The aquarium was stunningly beautiful, boasting a large, curved viewing pane that allowed for a clear, uninhibited view of the various marine creatures that swam gracefully within. To complete the underwater scene, the aquarium also featured a diverse selection of colorful corals and plants, accompanied by a soothing backdrop of softly glowing LED lights that danced and flickered like the sun's rays reflected off the ocean's surface. As Jessica gazed at her new underwater oasis, she couldn't help but notice the myriad of different species that happily coexisted within the glass confines. There were schools of vibrant, exotic fish, their scales shimmering with an iridescent brilliance that caught the light just so, creating dazzling patterns that mesmerized the observer. Alongside these captivating creatures, the tank was inhabited by a few types of crustaceans, cautiously peeking out from behind the coral structures and waving their delicate legs in a friendly greeting. It was obvious that Laura had taken Jessica's love for marine life into account when she chose the aquarium, and this thoughtfulness only added to the joy and appreciation that Jessica felt. The fact that Laura had gone to such lengths to make this a special gift truly warmed her heart. As the moments passed, a comfortable and companionable silence settled over the pair, accompanied by the euphonic sound of gently bubbling water. It was the kind of silence that only comes from years spent building a deep and abiding connection with another soul, a silence that spoke volumes without the need for words. Laura watched as Jessica's face continued to light up with happiness at the sight of her new aquatic treasure, and her heart swelled with love for her friend. The look on Jessica's face was all she needed to know that she had made the right decision in gifting her the aquarium - the joy being brought into their home was more than worth it. As the days went by, the aquarium and its many colorful inhabitants added an element of wonder and tranquility to their living space, becoming more than just a gift – it was a reminder of the powerful bond between two friends, a representation of the love, trust, and understanding that had brought them together and continued to keep them close. In time, the aquarium became a shared passion for both Laura and Jessica, serving as a constant source of inspiration and a serene place of refuge when life became too overwhelming. It was a testament to their lifelong journey, a journey that was enriched by the gift of friendship, and the love of the sea that bonded them."},{"question":"Участниками конвенции являются 144 страны.

According to many people on social media, the extreme similarity between the two works is glaringly obvious with comments like, “The Shape of Plagiarism?” and “I’m surprised Zindel’s family are not suing.” It may not come as a surprise to them that one of the producers of The Shape of Water has said on record, “I stole (grave robbed?) from everything I could.” Let’s examine the details of each work and hear what others have to say. Scroll to the bottom for links to watch and read Let Me Hear You Whisper. The two plots: Let Me Hear You Whisper Set in the 1960s, the plot follows a lonely, introverted female custodian at a research facility who falls in love with a captured aquatic creature, a dolphin, who talks only to her. When the creature refuses to cooperate with the scientists’ plan to be used as a military weapon, they decide they will kill it and dissect it. The custodian attempts to help the creature escape to the sea by means of a laundry cart. The Shape of Water Set in the 1960s, the plot follows a lonely, introverted female custodian at a research facility who falls in love with a captured aquatic creature who talks only to her. When the creature refuses to cooperate with the scientists’ plan to be used as a military weapon, they decide they will kill it and dissect it. The custodian attempts to help the creature escape to the sea by means of a laundry cart. A short introduction to each work: Let Me Hear You Whisper is a play written in 1969 by Pulitzer-Prize-winning playwright and young adult author Paul Zindel (The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon-Marigolds, The Pigman). The play earned wide recognition in its National Educational Television (NET) Network production filmed in 1969. Zindel wrote the screenplay and it starred Ruth White. The play was also filmed for A&E in 1990 starring Jean Stapleton and Rue McClanahan. The Shape of Water is a 2017 film directed by Guillermo del Toro and written by del Toro and Vanessa Taylor. The film won two Golden Globes, including Best Director for del Toro and has been nominated for many other awards including Best Original Screenplay. The film stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer. In both Let Me Hear You Whisper and The Shape of Water, the protagonist is a quiet, unmarried, and lonely cleaning woman who works the graveyard shift at a laboratory conducting secret experiments on an aquatic creature for military research during the 1960’s. (Both protagonists are pictured above in green wool overcoats.) A brief summary of the major similarities of the two works: Let Me Hear You Whisper AND The Shape of Water: The main character is a quiet, introverted female custodian who works the graveyard shift in a laboratory. Set in the 1960s during the Cold War, at a laboratory where experiments for military use are taking place The custodian discovers a tank with an aquatic creature who is being experimented on The custodian and the aquatic creature fall in love, a transformative love which enables both of them to be heard She wins his trust by sneaking food into the lab and feeding him. She dances to music on a record with her mop while the creature looks on and their bond grows deeper She is treated in a dehumanizing way by her superiors at the laboratory. She discovers that the scientists who run the lab want to use the creature as a military weapon if they can get him to cooperate but if not, he is to be vivisected for research purposes. She decides to rescue the creature and release him to the sea by sneaking him out of the facility in a laundry cart. What people are saying on social media about the similarities: The astonishing similarities between Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water and Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper have not gone unnoticed. At least one reviewer of The Shape of Water and numerous people across different platforms on social media have noticed as well. In Mark Leeper’s review of the Shape of Water, he mentions the extreme similarity between The Shape of Water and Let Me Hear You Whisper, saying, “I would say The Shape of Water has one major problem…In 1969 and again in 1990, PBS adapted to television Paul Zindel’s play ‘Let me Hear You Whisper.’ In this story, a downtrodden cleaning woman in a secret government laboratory finds a dolphin in a tank and befriends it. It has been trained to sing the words to ‘Let Me Call You Sweetheart.’ From that song, Zindel takes the title of the play. The cleaning woman discovers to her horror the dolphin is really being trained to fight wars undersea and be blown up with the munitions he carries. She determines to steal the dolphin in a laundry cart and set it free. That is much like del Toro‘s story but Zindel‘s name does not appear in the credits of the new film… I know of no statement from the filmmakers that mentions this film and Zindel‘s play in the same breath. I did not see Zindel‘s name anywhere in the credits. I will be interested to see how this problem plays out…I am sorry to see del Toro resorting to uncredited near-remakes of other people‘s stories.” In the comments section of Sheila O’Malley’s review of The Shape of Water on RogerEbert.com, user Leo comments, “Was the film influenced by Paul Zindel’s short play Let Me Hear You Whisper? (it used to be frequently on PBS)? Several users agree and user THEgillian replies saying:..“…there is NO WAY someone involved in the story was unfamiliar with the play. There are way too many similarities…I don’t mind if people take an idea and improve on it, but I really mind them not crediting the source. I’m surprised none of Zindel’s relatives are suing.” Several users on Twitter also commented on the striking similarity The Shape of Water has to Let Me Hear You Whisper. Twitter user Alfred coined the term, “The Shape of Plagiarism?” in his frank description of the similarities between The Shape of Water and Let Me Hear You Whisper, even attempting to alert several news outlets of his concerns by tweeting at them. While Twitter user Shanna comments, “Quick Google search indicates that I am not the only one to see the similarity between this film and the @paulzindel play.” Social media commentary on the similarity of the two can be found on youtube as well, with user Peter commenting on the CBC News video review of The Shape of Water, “Do the film’s credits acknowledge the television play from the 1960’s ‘Let Me Hear You Whisper,’ which was broadcast on Public Television in at least two versions?…” Just seeing The Shape of Water trailer was enough for some Twitter and Facebook users to comment on the similarity to Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper. Twitter user Edward commented, “Is it just me or does the del Toro The Shape of Water trailer seem way too similar to the play Let Me Hear You Whisper by Paul Zindel? Twitter user Jonathan commented, “the new del toro movie reminds me of Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper, a one act play about a janitor and an experimental dolphin.” Facebook Community Trust Me I’m A Nerd weighed in on the similarities as well and commented, “So it’s a movie version of Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper?” And Doug, a user on the forums for the roleplaying website RPG.net comments, “It actually kinda feels like the weirdest remake of Let Me Hear You Whisper possible.” Twitter user Danielle recently commented, “Throughout The Shape of Water I was just imagining Guillermo del Toro watching this old Jean Stapleton play and being like ‘what if the dolphin were…sexy?” She goes on to ask, “Am I the only one who just thought of Let Me Hear You Whisper during The Shape of Water? Surely it wasn’t just me! On January 16, Facebook user Zack posted, “The Shape of Water‘s plot is a LOT like this play…called Let Me Hear You Whisper, about a cleaning woman who develops a rapport with a dolphin in a lab being trained to speak…Surprised author Paul Zindel has not sued…” A few days before that, Facebook user Barbara noted the similarity as well, “I saw The Shape of Water. It reminded me very much of the wonderful play by Paul Zindel called Let Me Hear You Whisper, about a cleaning lady in a government lab where they are trying to train a captive dolphin. There was also a TV version, but it hasn’t been shown for years.” And at the end of December 2017, Facebook user Joseph had posted a series of screenshots from the 1969 TV production version of Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper and the dialogue from the film, along with the question: “which fish, first fish?” And the statement, “For the record.” Then in January 2018, right after The Shape of Water‘s 13 Academy Award nominations were announced, Joseph added, “How can Shape of Water be nominated for Best Original Screenplay when its premise, plot and central character are ripped off from Paul Zindel’s 1969 play Let Me Hear You Whisper?” Examining the details: Pinpointing the possible origin: How did this happen? How did The Shape of Water‘s plot end up with so many similarities to Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper as to rule out the possibility of a coincidence? How in the world does an established director such as Guillermo del Toro get himself into such a situation where he is copying someone else’s work so extensively that most who are familiar with Zindel’s play are describing it as plagiarism? In the January 2018 edition of Written By, the Writers Guild magazine interview with Guillermo del Toro, he describes a meeting with novelist Daniel Kraus, (credited on The Shape of Water as an associate producer). Del Toro explains he wanted to do a Creature from the Black Lagoon remake but he couldn’t find a way to do it in a romantic way. “Finally, over a breakfast with novelist Daniel Kraus in 2011, the code was broken. The novelist shared with del Toro a story idea “about a janitor that kidnaps an amphibian-man from a secret government facility.” I said, ‘That’s the way in!’ ” The “story idea” that Daniel Kraus shared with Guillermo del Toro at that breakfast meeting happens to be the exact plot of Paul Zindel’s 1969 play Let Me Hear You Whisper. As so many people have already pointed out on social media, it is very hard to believe that del Toro and Kraus were not familiar with Let Me Hear You Whisper as they made The Shape of Water. Digging a little deeper, one finds proof that Daniel Kraus is not only familiar with Paul Zindel’s work, but admires it, as evidenced in an article he wrote for Booklist in 2017 entitled “50 Best YA Books of All Time,” in which he includes Paul Zindel’s YA classic novel The Pigman near the very top of the list, describing it as, “…one of the earliest YA books to show teen life in all its darkness and complexity.” Daniel Kraus’ own website describes The Shape of Water, both the film and the upcoming novel as, “Based on an original idea by Guillermo del Toro and Daniel Kraus.” Interestingly, in an AMA Daniel Kraus did two years ago for the release of his novel, when asked about research resources for his writing process he said, “…I stole (grave robbed?) from everything I could.” Conclusion: Although Pulitzer-Prize-winning playwright Paul Zindel is no longer here (he died in 2003) to personally comment on the situation involving his play Let Me Hear You Whisper, his characters and their words live on through his works. At the end of Let Me Hear You Whisper, the introverted night custodian Helen finally finds her voice and says to the scientists, “You gotta talk back against what’s wrong or you can’t ever stop it. At least you’ve gotta try.” You can read Paul Zindel’s Let Me Hear You Whisper here, or from your local bookstore or library. You can watch the 1969 version of Let Me Hear You Whisper here.

The estate of late playwright Paul Zindel is slamming Fox Searchlight for allegedly borrowing the story behind Guillermo del Toro's Oscar hopeful The Shape of Water from a 1969 play without asking for rights. David Zindel, the son of the playwright and manager of his father's estate, told The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday that the film was \\"obviously derived\\" from the 1969 play Let Me Hear You Whisper, which follows a recently hired cleaning lady at a lab experimenting on mammals. The protagonist, Helen, takes pity on a dolphin the scientists have scheduled for a brain dissection after having failed to make it talk, and rescues the dolphin, putting it out to sea. The Shape of Water, similarly, follows a mute cleaning lady at a government lab who establishes a connection with a sea creature from the Amazon that scientists are experimenting on. She ultimately falls in love with the creature and plans to rescue it before the scientists can dissect it. \\"We are shocked that a major studio could make a film so obviously derived from my late father’s work without anyone recognizing it and coming to us for the rights,” Zindel told THR. Zindel's claims were first reported in The Guardian. Zindel said that he first learned of the similarities from fans of his father's work. \\"A lot of people are telling us they are struck by the substantial similarities and we are looking into it,\\" he wrote. \\"We are very grateful to Paul Zindel’s fans for bringing this to our attention.\\" He points to a page on the site Hollywood Nerd that compares the play and del Toro's film. Some of the alleged similarities are that the custodian protagonists both plot to help their respective sea creatures escape by hiding them in a laundry cart; both stories are set in the 1960s during the Cold War; both stories show the protagonist winning the creature's trust by sneaking him food and in both stories the custodian protagonist falls in love with the creature. Hollywood Nerd, whose domain was registered in 2013, is the website of actress Rachel Style, according to a screenshot from May 2014 available via The Wayback Machine. Style's IMDb profile, linked to in the screenshot, says that she is married to David Zindel. The Shape of Water's screenplay, nominated for a best original screenplay Oscar on Tuesday, was based on an original idea by both del Toro and author and filmmaker Daniel Kraus, according to Kraus' webpage and interviews that del Toro has given. The story has been released as both a film and an illustrated book in a \\"bold, two-tiered release,\\" Kraus writes. Paul Zindel, a Pulitzer Prize winner for The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, published his one-act play in 1969, and a television adaptation aired on A&E Television's series American Playwrights Theater in 1990, starring Jean Stapleton as its central cleaning woman. This isn't the first time that viewers have noted similarities between del Toro's film and another work: After viewers pointed out parallels between The Shape of Water and the 2015, 13-minute short The Space Between Us, the Netherlands Film Academy, which produced the short, issued a statement saying that the two films \\"have their own very different identities\\" on Monday. In response to Zindel's claim, Fox Searchlight issued the following statement to THR: \\"Guillermo del Toro has never read nor seen Mr. Zindel’s play in any form. Mr. del Toro has had a 25-year career during which he has made 10 feature films and has always been very open about acknowledging his influences. If the Zindel family has questions about this original work, we welcome a conversation with them.\\" Jan. 25, 6:21 p.m. Updated with information about the Hollywood Nerd website. ||||| Exclusive: playwright's estate says The Shape of Water used his work without credit The estate of the Pulitzer-winning playwright Paul Zindel has accused the film The Shape of Water of using the late writer’s work without credit, arguing that Guillermo del Toro’s movie, which is leading in Oscar nominations, was “obviously derived” from a 1969 play. David Zindel, son of the American playwright, told the Guardian he believes his father’s work Let Me Hear You Whisper, a play about a female janitor in a research laboratory who bonds with a captive dolphin and tries to rescue the creature, is a source of inspiration for The Shape of Water. Del Toro’s film was nominated on Tuesday for 13 Oscars, including best picture, best director and best original screenplay. “We are shocked that a major studio could make a film so obviously derived from my late father’s work without anyone recognizing it and coming to us for the rights,” Zindel, who runs his father’s estate, said in an email to the Guardian. Oscar nods pour in for The Shape of Water in year coloured by #MeToo Read more The Shape of Water, the critically acclaimed film co-written by Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor, tells the story of a cleaner who works in a Baltimore laboratory in the 1960s and falls in love with a sea creature whom she attempts to rescue. In terms of the broad concept, specific plot points and some characters, the film has close similarities to Let Me Hear You Whisper, which was aired as a TV production nearly 50 years ago. The creative team behind The Shape of Water, which stars Sally Hawkins, has presented the film as an original idea and has not mentioned Zindel’s work as an inspiration. A Fox Searchlight spokesperson denied the allegations, which have been circulating on the internet. But this is the first time the playwright’s family has commented on the controversy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Scenes from Let Me Hear You Whisper, left, and The Shape of Water. Photograph: YouTube/Allstar/Fox Searchlight Pictures In both stories, a female cleaner works a night shift at a lab and falls for an aquatic creature that is the subject of mysterious science experiments. Both women develop a relationship by bringing food to the animal and dancing with a mop in front of the tank to the tune of a love song. The two cleaner characters both learn to communicate with the creatures, and both labs are involved in secretive military operations. The protagonists both discover imminent plans to kill the creature, and both labs mention “vivisection”. Both women also devise plans to rescue the animal and release it to the sea by sneaking it out in a laundry cart. In Let Me Hear You Whisper, named after a song lyric that the laboratory plays for the dolphin, the creature repeatedly says “hamper” to the protagonist, Helen, to encourage her to get a laundry cart. Both women are friends with another janitor who helps them – Danielle in one version of Zindel’s work and Zelda in Del Toro’s film, played by Octavia Spencer, who was nominated for an acting Oscar alongside Hawkins. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Zindel. Photograph: Courtesy David Zindel There are also major differences in the two stories. In The Shape of Water, the main character, Elisa, is mute and communicates in sign language with the creature. Helen speaks, but does reference muteness when discussing the dolphin’s inability to talk to the scientists, saying: “Some human beings are mute, you know. Just because they can’t talk, we don’t kill them.” The Shape of Water also has another significant character: Elisa’s gay friend, played by Richard Jenkins. There are further substantial differences in the endings of the two works. Paul Zindel, who died in 2003, won the 1971 drama Pulitzer for the play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. Bonnie Zindel, the playwright’s former wife, said Let Me Hear You Whisper was one of the earliest plays he wrote and one of the first performed on television. The work had a “special place in Paul’s heart”, she said in an email, adding that the playwright was a chemistry teacher before his writing career, which inspired the laboratory setting. She noted that they watched it together during the Vietnam war and that the themes of the play reflected his belief “that love, not war, is the answer to world peace”. Fox Searchlight responded in a statement on Thursday, saying: “Guillermo del Toro has never read nor seen Mr Zindel’s play in any form. Mr del Toro has had a 25 year career during which he has made 10 feature films and has always been very open about acknowledging his influences. If the Zindel family has questions about this original work we welcome a conversation with them.” In a recent interview with Del Toro in a magazine called Written By, the director said the idea originated in part through a conversation with the novelist Daniel Kraus (an associate producer of the film), who suggested a story about a “janitor that kidnaps an amphibian-man from a secret government facility”. Kraus’s website says the film is “based on an original idea” by him and Del Toro. Kraus did not respond to a request for comment. Viewers of The Shape of Water have increasingly noted the Zindel comparisons on social media in recent months. “A lot of people are telling us they are struck by the substantial similarities,” David Zindel said in an email. “We are very grateful to Paul Zindel’s fans for bringing this to our attention.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"The team behind Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-nominated film, “The Shape of Water”, has been accused of taking the story from the writer Paul Zindel’s 1969 play, “Let Me Hear You Whisper”.

Article: When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, \\"Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish\\", I remember being even more upset then because, \\"I'm not a fish!\\" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, \\"We all need to think like sales people.\\" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, \\"If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.\\" What he said was, \\"You need to think like a fish.\\" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

A cancer sufferer running a gruelling marathon was forced to stop by officials after just eight miles - because she was 'too slow.' Single mother Anne Pharo travelled to Germany to compete in the Frankfurt Marathon but was left humiliated when she was ordered to stop running. The 41-year-old, who is battling breast cancer, even claims officials and police followed her closely for four miles demanding her to 'run faster or give up.' Ms Pharo, of Leigh Park, Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in January this year. Furious: Cancer sufferer Anne Pharo (pictured holding medals from previously successful fund-raising events) claims she was forced to stop running the Frankfurt marathon because officials said she was 'too slow' 'When my friend suggested last year that we do","response":"the Frankfurt Marathon together, I was so excited to take on the challenge and raise awareness and funds for breast cancer research,' said an emotional Ms. Pharo. Despite the difficult journey she has been on, including undergoing chemotherapy, having a mastectomy, and facing numerous complications, Anne remained determined to participate in the event to prove to herself and others that she could still push her limits and make a difference. With the support of her friends and loved ones, Anne trained diligently for the marathon, fully aware that it would be an uphill battle because of her condition and ongoing treatment. As the race day approached, Anne made the necessary travel arrangements, filled with anticipation and courage to face the 26.2-mile feat. When the marathon began, Anne put her heart and soul into the race, running with passion fueled by all the struggles she had overcome throughout her cancer battle. She knew that this marathon was not just about reaching the finish line but about inspiring others in similar situations to stay strong and fight against all odds. However, Anne's determination to complete the marathon was met with an unexpected and disheartening obstacle. It seemed as if the very people who were supposed to encourage participants and maintain a supportive environment decided to target her for being unable to keep up with the minimum pace required. In spite of her circumstances, Anne quietly endured their harsh demands and the indignity of being chased down by police and race officials. Outraged by this unfair treatment, Anne's family and friends quickly rallied around her, demanding an explanation and apology from the marathon organizers. They argue that Anne's incredible perseverance and bravery should have been celebrated, not punished, and that officials should have exercised empathy and understanding towards her struggle. In response to the incident, Anne has decided to share her story to raise awareness about the challenges faced by cancer fighters and the importance of providing inclusive and supportive environments in athletic events like marathons. She hopes that by speaking out, she can inspire changes in the way marathons and other races are organized, fostering compassion and inclusivity for all participants, regardless of their personal circumstances. Moreover, Anne is determined not to let this disheartening experience stand in the way of her goals. She remains committed to her fight against cancer and plans to compete in another marathon soon, proving once again that it is possible to achieve greatness in the face of adversity. By continuing to run and advocate for others, Anne Pharo stands as a symbol of strength and resilience and a true inspiration to us all."},{"question":"She was taken aback by his real personality, what were other past boyfriends like to her?

William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

At least five weather-related deaths have been reported since rains began spreading over the Eastern Seaboard, which has appeared to dodge the full fury of Hurricane Joaquin churning hundreds of miles out in the Atlantic. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in South Carolina and ordered federal aid to bolster state and local efforts as flood warnings remained in effect for many parts of the East Coast through Sunday. The steady downpour drew its moisture from a slow-moving low-pressure system over the Southeast that has linked up to a finger of tropical moisture from Hurricane Joaquin. Heavy rain was expected to continue overnight in the Carolinas and parts of northern Georgia and could cause some significant river and stream flooding, the National Weather Service said. The low-pressure system also was expected to whip up stiff northeasterly winds in the Blue Ridge mountains of the Carolinas and western Virginia with gusts up to 35 mph through Sunday, the weather service said. With tree roots already loosened in waterlogged soil, increased winds held the prospect of toppling trees onto power lines or property. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” North Carolina emergency management director Mike Sprayberry said late Saturday. High winds toppled a tree that hit a vehicle and killed a passenger Thursday near Fayetteville, North Carolina. Three people died in separate weather-related traffic incidents in South Carolina on Friday and Saturday, the Highway Patrol said. A drowning in Spartanburg, South Carolina, also was linked to the storm. The Greenville-Spartanburg Airport in South Carolina recorded 2.3 inches of rain Saturday, smashing the previous record of 0.77 inches set in 1961, according to John Tomko, National Weather Service meteorologist at Greenville-Spartanburg. “This one is extraordinary in that it’s such a prolonged event,” he said. Downtown Charleston was closed off to incoming traffic Saturday as rain flooded roads and left some motorists stranded as flood waters engulfed their cars, including a white BMW with water to the engine. At least two bridges were washed out in other parts of the state “Where we normally are dealing with flooding for a few hours, we’re dealing with it in days here,” Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen told The Associated Press. “We’re seeing areas flood today that did not traditionally flood.” Flooded roads were closed throughout the mid-Atlantic region and power companies reported scattered outages in several states. In New Jersey, storms dislodged an entire house from its pilings in a low-lying area of Middle Township in southern Jersey. No one was in the residence. Flood watches and warnings also are in effect in Delaware and parts of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. The weather service issued a warning for residents living along the coast to be alert for rising water. A combination of high water and high waves could cause beach erosion and damage docks and piers. In Ocean City, Maryland, spokeswoman Jessica Waters said moderate high tide flooding Saturday forced street closures in low-lying areas but caused no major damages or injuries. Meanwhile, the Atlantic Seaboard was spared what could have been much worse damage had Joaquin not continued on a path well off the U.S. coast. And some people found ways to enjoy the wet weather, cavorting in kayaks and canoes in some flooded areas. Steven Capito spent the day surfing by the Ocean View Fishing Pier in Norfolk, Virginia, where two- to three-foot waves crashed ashore. Ordinarily, he said waves from the Chesapeake Bay would barely lap his ankles. “It’s kind of a fun novelty to be out here in the bay,” said Capito, who lives in Virginia Beach. “You only get to do it a couple of times a year and it’s nice and warm.” Smith reported from Charleston and Foreman from Charlotte, North Carolina. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Brock Vergakis in Norfolk, Virginia; David Dishneau in Ocean City, Maryland; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey, and Julie Walker in New York.","response":"Record-setting rain and flooding have hit the heavily populated East Coast of the United States, causing destruction of bridges and homes.

Our problem is: 58 * o - 74 * o = -81 * o - 163 * o - 12996 We need to find the value of 'o'. To do that, let's start by simplifying both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have 58 * o and -74 * o. To combine them, just think of it like this - if you have 58 apples times 'o' and you take away 74 apples times 'o', how many apples times 'o' do you have left? So we subtract 74 * o from 58 * o: 58 * o - 74 * o = -16 * o Now, the left side of our equation is -16 * o. On the right side, we have -81 * o and -163 * o. Let's do the same thing we did with the left side. If we have -81 apples times 'o' and we take away another 163 apples times 'o', how many apples times 'o' do we have left? We just add -81 * o and -163 * o: -81 * o - 163 * o = -244 * o Now, our right side is -244 * o - 12996. So now our equation looks like this: -16 * o = -244 * o - 12996 We want to get all the 'o' terms on one side of the equation, so let's add 244 * o to both sides to cancel out the -244 * o on the right side: -16 * o + 244 * o = -244 * o + 244 * o - 12996 This simplifies to: 228 * o = -12996 Now, we want to find the value of 'o', so we will divide both sides of the equation by 228: 228 * o / 228 = -12996 / 228 So: o = -57 That's it, buddy! We found that the value of o is -57. Great job following along!"},{"question":"What is a person called who doesn't have immortality? Options: - mortal - dying - death - dead - mortal Let's think now!

The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term \\"pragmatism\\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \\"pragmaticism\\". Along with its pragmatic theory of truth, this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and rational (concept-based) thinking.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Given the context provided, we can infer that the question seeks to understand which mindset - pragmatism or pragmaticism - can be considered more abstract. To answer this question, we'll dive deep into the key differences between the two philosophical perspectives and evaluate their abstractness based on the principles adhered to by each. Pragmatism, as originally conceived by Charles Sanders Peirce and later popularized by William James, is an American philosophy that emphasizes the practical consequences and real-world effects of concepts and ideas as key elements to determine their meaning and truth. Pragmatism posits that truth is what works and is useful, rejecting the notion that theories must correspond to a pre-existing, objective reality. Rather, they must be proven through their practical application and the results they produce. Consequently, pragmatism focuses more on the empirical aspects of experience, with the ultimate goal being the development of effective problem-solving techniques in both personal and social contexts. Pragmaticism, on the other hand, is Peirce's modified version of pragmatism, aiming to distance itself from the tangents taken by the pragmatism movement. Unlike the broader and more encompassing pragmatism, pragmaticism is more narrowly defined and focused on the original principles put forth by Peirce. Pragmaticism upholds logic, scientific inquiry, and the search for truth as central tenets, while also giving importance to the role of experience and empirical evidence. It incorporates rational or concept-based thinking to a greater extent than pragmatism, integrating empirical and rational thought processes to establish a coherent framework for understanding reality. When comparing the two mindsets – pragmatism and pragmaticism – and determining which can be considered more abstract, it is important to examine the extent to which each perspective delves into theoretical concepts and underlying principles. Pragmatism leans heavily on the practical application of ideas, relying on their real-world utility and consequences to ascertain their value and validity. This approach, while valuable in many instances, can be seen as less abstract since it prioritizes observable outcomes over fundamental beliefs and principles. Pragmaticism, in contrast, subscribes to a more theory-driven approach, aligning itself closely with logical reasoning and scientific inquiry. This mindset delves deeper into the foundational concepts and overarching principles that shape our understanding of reality, integrating both empirical evidence and rational thought to arrive at a coherent worldview. Given its greater focus on theoretical constructs and systematic exploration of ideas, pragmaticism can be regarded as the more abstract mindset when compared to pragmatism. In summary, while both pragmatism and pragmaticism stem from similar roots and place significant emphasis on the role of experience, they differ in the level of importance they assign to theoretical concepts and rational thinking. Pragmatism prioritizes practical application and results, making it less abstract, while pragmaticism indulges in a more comprehensive exploration of ideas and principles, qualifying it as the more abstract mindset between these two philosophical perspectives."},{"question":"Answer a question about this article: The Bovington signal course's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English, displaying a firm command of voice procedure.

In the world of figure skating, it is natural for conflicts to arise due to the high-pressure environment, differing expectations, and the need for constant improvement. This makes it essential for athletes to have access to psychological support in order to navigate these challenges effectively. When faced with conflicts, it is important for skaters to maintain open communication and understanding with all parties involved. This includes discussing any concerns, acknowledging differing perspectives, and working together to find a solution that benefits everyone. A psychologist can help facilitate these conversations and mediate any disputes that may arise. Additionally, a psychologist can help athletes develop emotional resilience in order to cope with the inevitable challenges that come with being a competitive figure skater. This involves teaching them about self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Building these competencies can help skaters respond more effectively to conflicts and reduce the lasting impact they might have on their mental wellbeing. Moreover, a psychologist can provide athletes with strategies to help them manage performance anxiety, which is a common issue faced by figure skaters. This might include relaxation techniques, visualization exercises, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help challenge negative thoughts and beliefs. By overcoming performance anxiety, skaters can enhance their focus, improve their overall performance, and, in turn, experiencing fewer conflicts within their sport environment. It is also crucial for coaches, choreographers, and other support staff to be aware of the potential conflicts that can arise in the competitive figure skating world. They should work collaboratively with athletes and their families to create a supportive and inclusive environment, promoting positive interactions and fostering mutual respect. By doing this, they can help minimize conflicts and create a more positive atmosphere for everyone involved. In conclusion, the role of a psychologist in competitive figure skating is multifaceted, involving conflict resolution, emotional resilience development, performance anxiety management, and fostering a supportive environment. By continually addressing these aspects, psychologists can help athletes navigate conflicts and reach their full potential in their sport."},{"question":"Produce a brief English sentence that would be considered grammatically as category: i.

It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre., what would be the answer ?

In the TV sitcom 'Friends' what is the name of Phoebe's twin sister?","response":"In the popular TV sitcom 'Friends,' Phoebe Buffay's twin sister is named Ursula Buffay. Ursula is portrayed by the same actress, Lisa Kudrow. Ursula Buffay is a recurring character on 'Friends' and her storyline significantly intertwines with Phoebe's. She is also a character on the show 'Mad About You,' which aired around the same time as 'Friends.' Ursula was initially introduced on 'Mad About You' before her character was adapted into the 'Friends' storyline as Phoebe's twin sister. This crossover brought an interesting connection between the two popular TV shows. As for the characters themselves, both Phoebe and Ursula have strikingly different personalities. Phoebe is an eccentric, kind-hearted, and somewhat naive individual who is known for her quirky behavior, odd sense of humor, and unique approach to life. She works as a freelance masseuse and a musician, often performing original songs at Central Perk, the gang's favorite coffee shop hangout. On the other hand, Ursula is quite the opposite; she is portrayed as an extremely nonchalant, carefree, and self-centered person who displays little concern for others. She frequently forgets people's names, including her sister's, and generally makes a minimal effort to form relationships or even engage in basic conversations. Ursula works as a waitress at Riff's, a restaurant in 'Mad About You,' and later as a pornographic film actress (under Phoebe's name) in 'Friends.' Throughout the 'Friends' series, Ursula's appearances often lead to tension-filled encounters and awkward situations with Phoebe and the rest of the group. The two sisters have a rocky relationship due to their conflicting personalities and contrasting outlooks on life. However, these interactions add an interesting dynamic, humor, and depth to Phoebe's character and contribute to the overall appeal of the show."},{"question":"Definition: Given a paragraph from a Wikipedia article about some topic, and a question related to the topic, determine whether the question is answerable from the paragraph.

A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487. The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row. Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487. The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia. Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises. Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum. Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd (pictured) Father-of-three Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving – drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487 between in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment. He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home. Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions. 'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients. 'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said. The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit. He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue. The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours. But Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'. He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car. 'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.' He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"A man named Gwyn Roberts, who is a doctor and a father, drank too much alcohol and decided to drive. This is not good, because drinking alcohol can make driving very dangerous. Unfortunately, he ended up having a car accident, which seriously hurt two people.

If there are things you could get your partner, your kids, or a hired hand to do – washing the dishes, walking the dog, and so on – separate them into your “Delegate” list. This will rebalance your family’s time in such a way that you all have the ability to spend more time together, instead of you and/or your partner taking on a disproportionate amount of housework. Be realistic and honest when evaluating your time. Don’t add something to your “Do” list just because you feel guilty. Organize your work tasks, too, so that you can identify which things need doing and which you can delegate to a coworker. You can lose a lot of time that can be spent with your family (or on yourself) by searching for misplaced keys, remote controls, and other essential belongings. Choose a convenient location for your wallet or purse, your keys, and your glasses. Get in the habit of placing these essentials – especially the things you seem to lose frequently – in the same place every day. For instance, you might choose to always put your glasses by the bedside, and your keys by the door. Look for ways to save time and use them whenever possible. For instance, if your dry cleaner offers free pickup, or you can get your pizza delivered instead of picking it up, spring for these convenience services. This will help you maximize your family time. If you’re enrolled in university, use the campus gym instead of trekking from school to the gym and then home. If you’re the type of person who rises to a challenge, you might benefit from trying to make and meet unique family-related goals. Set a minimum amount of time to spend with your family each week – for instance, 15 hours. Or you could try a qualitative goal like making your child smile at dinner. Change your family-time goals regularly to keep the contest fresh. Instead of checking email, working on projects, and texting friends or coworkers when you’re home, turn your phone off and shut down your computer. This way, your family will get your undivided attention. After your kids and partner are asleep, you can log back on. This is especially important during family outings and meals. You can also use your computer and phone early in the morning, when your kids and partner are asleep. Some people get discouraged because they think, “I could never maximize my family time in the way that my neighbor did.” This is defeatist thinking and will not help you maximize your family time. Instead, organize your time as well a possible without passing judgment on yourself. Remember, nobody can spend all their time with their family. Summary:","response":"To make more time for your family, make three lists: \\"Do,\\" \\"Don't Do,\\" and \\"Delegate.\\" Put important tasks on the \\"Do\\" list, tasks that can wait on the \\"Don't Do\\" list, and tasks others can help with on the \\"Delegate\\" list.

Question 2: How will Trump's victory affect India? pick from the following. [+] no; [+] yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","response":"[+] yes; The answer to these two questions would be the same, as they both address the impact of Donald Trump's victory on India and its interests. Below, I provide a detailed and long answer exploring various aspects of Trump's victory on Indian interests and the consequences of his presidency for India. 1. Economic Impact: a. Trade Policies: Trump's protectionist trade policies, particularly his 'America First' policy, led to the renegotiation of trade agreements and imposition of tariffs on major trade partners including India. These trade policies created uncertainties in global trade and affected India's export-oriented industries, particularly the Information Technology (IT) sector. However, it also provided opportunities for India to review and recalibrate its trade policies and priorities. b. H1B Visa Policies: Trump administration's tightening of H1B visa rules impacted Indian IT professionals and companies, as a large number of Indian IT experts migrate to the US every year. This not only affected the operations of Indian IT firms but also restrained the mobility and opportunities for Indian professionals in the US. c. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Trump's policies aimed at promoting domestic manufacturing and investment resulted in slightly reduced foreign direct investment from the US into India. However, India remained an attractive destination for global investors due to its large market and growth potential. 2. Political Impact: a. Indo-US relations: Trump's presidency saw a continuation of the strategic partnership between India and the US, focusing on defense cooperation, counter-terrorism, and trade. Although there were areas of contention, such as Trump's criticism of India on climate change and the Paris Agreement, overall, the partnership remained robust. b. Regional Stability: Trump's policy on South Asia was a mixed bag for India. On one hand, his administration's hard stance on Pakistan's support for terrorism was appreciated in India. On the other hand, the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and imposition of sanctions adversely affected India's engagement with Iran and its role in the development of the Chabahar Port. c. The Indo-Pacific Strategy: Trump administration's focus on Indo-Pacific and the concept of the 'Quad' (comprising India, US, Japan, and Australia) provided India the opportunity to play a crucial role in ensuring peace and stability in the region. However, the lack of a coherent strategy and consistent policy often left India in a conundrum. 3. Social Impact: a. Indian Diaspora: Trump's rhetoric on immigration and tightening of visa rules raised concerns among the Indian diaspora in the US. The changing social and political environment led to instances of hate crimes against Indians and other ethnic minorities, causing distress to the community. b. Soft Power: While bilateral engagements and defense cooperation continued between India and the US, Trump's image and controversial statements often proved counterproductive in projecting the shared values of democracy and pluralism between the two countries. In conclusion, the impact of Donald Trump's victory on Indian interests was complex and multifaceted, with both positive and negative outcomes. While it presented challenges in certain areas of economic and social engagement, it also provided opportunities for India to realign its strategies and strengthen its position in the global arena. The relationship between India and the US under Trump's presidency was defined by a mix of cooperation and contestations, which required India to adopt a nimble and nuanced approach."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

A poor man and his young son arrive exhausted at a small outpost. There, the man confronts Luke Fletcher (Donald O'Brien), a sneering crook in the employ of a rich and powerful landowner called Barret. The man tells Fletcher that Barret has swindled him and his son out of money for some non-existent land. The bitter altercation ends with the man shot dead right in front of his son. As the killer laughs sadistically, the little boy picks up his father's gun and shoots Fletcher dead. Impassively, the boy mounts Fletcher's horse, claiming it along with its ornate silver-trimmed saddle, and rides off.Several years later, the young boy has grown up into a rugged bounty hunter named Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma) who rides into the Texan town of Cerriotts on his silver-saddled horse, accompanied by Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), an amusing but treacherous man he recently met. Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake. This is why he wants to tag along: Snake collects items of value from the frequent corpses encountered at every turn in the Wild West. Roy's arrival is also noted by Turner, a mysterious blond-haird cowboy (Gianni De Luigi).Roy meets with Shiba (Licinia Lentini), a well-to-do madam of the town's local whorehouse, who is also an old flame who wants more. She tells Roy that a man called Shep is extorting money from her, for a Mexican named Grenache (Aldo Sambrell). Her business will be ruined unless she pays up the following day. Roy obligingly shoots Shep and some of his cronies. Once again Snake turns up, shadowing Roy for spoils. The blond cowboy appears and makes a deal with Snake who offers it to Roy: 2,000 for a hit on one Thomas Barret, to be executed in a graveyard out of town.

Hunter was very good at writing articles but Kyle was not.","response":"Hunter was very good at writing articles, having a natural talent for putting his thoughts onto paper in a clear and concise manner. His ability to captivate readers with engaging content seemed almost effortless. Whether it was a news piece, an opinion column, or a well-researched article, Hunter managed to deliver high-quality writing consistently, never failing to surprise his audience with his unique perspective. On the other hand, Kyle struggled with his writing. Unlike Hunter, Kyle seemed unable to communicate his ideas effectively on paper. He faced numerous challenges, ranging from difficulties organizing his thoughts to an inability to find the right words to express his feelings or arguments. Kyle's struggles were not due to a lack of effort. He was determined to improve, and often spent hours researching and re-writing each piece he worked on, trying to make his articles more engaging and informative. It was as if every sentence was a struggle for him, a battle to find the right way to communicate his point. Nevertheless, Kyle remained committed to improving his writing abilities. He consistently sought feedback from his peers, took writing courses, and looked to Hunter for guidance. Slowly but surely, he began to see small improvements in his work. His sentence structure became clearer, his grammar improved, and he gradually built up a broader vocabulary to help articulate his thoughts. Hunter, recognizing Kyle's resilience and determination, took it upon himself to mentor his friend and help him refine his skills. They spent countless hours together, analyzing Kyle's work, discussing various writing techniques and strategies, and comparing different styles. Hunter shared his writing secrets with Kyle, teaching him the importance of a strong opening hook, smooth transitions, and a compelling conclusion. He also stressed the importance of research and fact-checking, ensuring that Kyle understood the significance of being well-informed and thorough in his work. They used real-world examples of great writing, deconstructing articles published in renowned newspapers and magazines, to illustrate what made them stand out. Through perseverance and consistent practice, Kyle slowly began to develop a voice of his own. He started to gain confidence, noticing that his writing had begun to captivate readers with engaging content and thought-provoking insights. With every small victory, Kyle's determination only grew, and he found himself even more motivated to refine his writing skills and share his unique perspective. As time went on, the once vast gap that existed between Hunter and Kyle's writing abilities began to narrow. And while it was clear that Hunter's innate talent for writing still set him apart, Kyle's hard work, determination, and his willingness to learn, allowed him to make significant strides. Ultimately, Kyle's journey to become a better writer not only demonstrated the power of perseverance but also served as a testament to the transformative power of mentorship. By working with Hunter and receiving the guidance, support, and encouragement that he needed, Kyle was able to transform his weaknesses into strengths, and eventually, he too became known for his ability to write captivating articles. Both Hunter and Kyle continued to write, each making their mark in the world of journalism. Now seasoned writers, they also used their experiences to inspire and mentor the younger generation, fostering a deep-rooted passion for writing and helping others excel in a craft that had once seemed unattainable."},{"question":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Yes or no. Answer:","response":"Yes, the information you found on Google is correct but requires further elaboration. \\"Mazel Tov!\\" is a Jewish phrase used to express congratulations and well-wishes for someone who has experienced a happy event or noteworthy accomplishment. The phrase itself comes from the Hebrew words \\"מזל\\" (Mazel), which means \\"luck\\" or \\"fortune,\\" and \\"טוב\\" (Tov), which means \\"good.\\" Therefore, when combined, \\"Mazel Tov!\\" can be understood as \\"good luck\\" or \\"good fortune.\\" This expression can be used for a variety of occasions such as weddings, bar or bat mitzvahs, engagements, graduation, and other significant milestones. You might have found it written on a wine glass tag to celebrate an event like a wedding, birthday, or graduation party. The use of the phrase indicates that the occasion is worth commemorating and is reflective of the joy and success the person has attained. It is important to note that though the phrase does mention luck or fortune, the sentiment behind it is more about expressing happiness for the other person's success rather than wishing them good luck. \\"Mazel Tov!\\" is a warm, celebratory phrase that is universally recognized within Jewish culture and is often used by both religious and non-religious Jews, as well as people from various cultural backgrounds. In conclusion, the answer you found on Google is correct in that \\"Mazel Tov!\\" is a congratulatory phrase used in Jewish culture for celebrating happy events and accomplishments. Nonetheless, the phrase's meaning goes beyond merely being written on a wine glass tag, as it carries a deeper significance of wishing the person good fortune and happiness."},{"question":"To se musí počítat.

Jessica Rich and FTC staff will be available to take questions from the media about the case. In a complaint filed today, the Federal Trade Commission is charging mobile phone service provider T-Mobile USA, Inc., with making hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for purported “premium” SMS subscriptions that, in many cases, were bogus charges that were never authorized by its customers. The FTC alleges that T-Mobile received anywhere from 35 to 40 percent of the total amount charged to consumers for subscriptions for content such as flirting tips, horoscope information or celebrity gossip that typically cost 9.99 per month. According to the FTC’s complaint, T-Mobile in some cases continued to bill its customers for these services offered by scammers years after becoming aware of signs that the charges were fraudulent. Excerpts from an actual T-Mobile bill showing cramming charges. (click to view full-size) “It’s wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,” said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. “The FTC’s goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.” In a process known as “third-party billing,” a phone company places charges on a consumer’s bill for services offered by another company, often receiving a substantial percentage of the amount charged. When the charges are placed on the bill without the consumer’s authorization, it is known as “cramming.” The FTC’s complaint alleges that in some cases, T-Mobile was charging consumers for services that had refund rates of up to 40 percent in a single month. The FTC has alleged that because such a large number of people were seeking refunds, it was an obvious sign to T-Mobile that the charges were never authorized by its customers. As the complaint notes, the refund rate likely significantly understates the percentage of consumers who were crammed. The complaint also states that internal company documents show that T-Mobile had received a high number of consumer complaints at least as early as 2012. The FTC has made significant efforts to end mobile cramming. In the last year, in addition to holding a public workshop on mobile cramming, the Commission has filed several lawsuits against alleged mobile cramming operations Jesta Digital, Wise Media, and Tatto Inc. According to today’s complaint, T-Mobile billed its customers for the services of these FTC defendants as well as an operation sued by the Texas Attorney General. The complaint against T-Mobile alleges that the company’s billing practices made it difficult for consumers to detect that they were being charged, much less by whom. When consumers viewed a summary of their T-Mobile bill online, according to the complaint, it did not show consumers that they were being charged by a third party, or that the charge was part of a recurring subscription. The heading under which the charges would be listed, “Premium Services,” could only be seen after clicking on a separate heading called “Use Charges.” Even after clicking, though, consumers still could not see the individual charges. The complaint also alleges that T-Mobile’s full phone bills, which can be longer than 50 pages, made it nearly impossible for consumers to find and understand third-party subscription charges. After looking past a “Summary” section as well as an “Account Service Detail” section, both of which described “Usage Charges” but did not itemize those charges, a consumer might then reach the section labeled “Premium Services,” where the crammed items would be listed. According to the complaint, the information would be listed there in an abbreviated form, such as “8888906150BrnStorm23918,” that did not explain that the charge was for a recurring third-party subscription supposedly authorized by the consumer. In addition, the complaint notes that consumers who use pre-paid calling plans do not receive monthly bills, and as a result the subscription fee was debited from their pre-paid account without their knowledge. When consumers were able to determine they were being charged for services they hadn’t ordered, the complaint alleges that T-Mobile in many cases failed to provide consumers with full refunds. Indeed, the FTC charged that T-Mobile refused refunds to some customers, offering only partial refunds of two months’ worth of the charges to others, and in other cases instructed consumers to seek refunds directly from the scammers – without providing accurate contact information to do so. The complaint also notes that in some cases, T-Mobile claimed that consumers had authorized the charges despite having no proof of consumers doing so. The FTC’s complaint seeks a court order to permanently prevent T-Mobile from engaging in mobile cramming and to obtain refunds for consumers and disgorgement of T-Mobile’s ill-gotten gains. The FTC thanks the Federal Communications Commission and its Enforcement Bureau for their invaluable assistance with and close cooperation and coordination in this matter. The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint was 5-0. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court.

The response from T-Mobile CEO John Legere isn’t exactly what you would describe as contrite. “We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit,” writes Legere. “In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want.” So there you go, America. T-Mobile shouldn’t be sued for something it made a mountain of money from because it is no longer making that mountain of money and it’s offering refunds to customers who “feel” they were charged for something they didn’t order. Legere — who struts around in a leather coat, crashing his competitors’ parties, has a history of making grandiose statements about his company and blatantly mocking his much bigger competitors, and who recently used the word “rape” in reference to AT&T and Verizon — calls the FTC suit “sensationalized,” which is a bit like Bob Hope calling Bing Crosby dead. Legere comes across like the snotty teen who got caught doing something wrong and then cops an attitude when he’s told that “I’m no longer doing it” does not wipe away the transgression. In speaking with reporters after today’s announcement, Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, explained that the agency “did engage in settlement negotiations with T-Mobile, but were not able to reach a settlement.” Here is the entire statement from Legere, presented in appropriately colored text: We have seen the complaint filed today by the FTC and find it to be unfounded and without merit. In fact T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want. T-Mobile is fighting harder than any of the carriers to change the way the wireless industry operates and we are disappointed that the FTC has chosen to file this action against the most pro-consumer company in the industry rather than the real bad actors. As the Un-carrier, we believe that customers should only pay for what they want and what they sign up for.” said John Legere, CEO T Mobile USA. “We exited this business late last year, and announced an aggressive program to take care of customers and we are disappointed that the FTC has instead chosen to file this sensationalized legal action. We are the first to take action for the consumer, I am calling for the entire industry to do the same. This is about doing what is right for consumers and we put in place procedures to protect our customers from unauthorized charges. Unfortunately, not all of these third party providers acted responsibly—an issue the entire industry faced. We believe those providers should be held accountable, and the FTC’s lawsuit seeking to hold T-Mobile responsible for their acts is not only factually and legally unfounded, but also misdirected. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — T-Mobile USA knowingly made hundreds of millions off its customers in bogus charges, a federal regulator alleged Tuesday in a complaint likely to damage the reputation of a household name in wireless communications. In its complaint filed in federal court, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services such as 10-per-month horoscopes that were never authorized by the account holder. The FTC alleges that T-Mobile collected as much as 40 percent of the charges, even after being alerted by other customers that the subscriptions were scams. \\"It's wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,\\" said FTC Chair Edith Ramirez. \\"The FTC's goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.\\" The practice is often referred to as \\"cramming\\": businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges associated with a third party. In this case, the FTC says T-Mobile should have realized that many of these premium text services were scams because of the high rate of customer complaints. But while as many as 40 percent of customers demanded refunds, others didn't notice the charges. Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc., is a publicly traded company. According to its website, Deutsche Telekom AG maintains a 67 percent ownership in the company's common stock. |||||Summary:","response":"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against T-Mobile USA in 2014, alleging that the mobile phone service provider made hundreds of millions of dollars by placing charges on mobile phone bills for premium SMS subscriptions without customer authorization.

Lichens grow on the rock surface, and the breakdown of rock underneath the lichen suggests a chemical or physical change taking place. Let's analyze step-by-step: 1. Lichens consist of a combination of fungi and algae, which are living organisms. 2. The rock surface is a non-living, natural material. 3. Lichens are known to secrete acids that break down rock surfaces to obtain essential mineral nutrients. 4. The breakdown of the rock surface due to lichen growth is a common phenomenon. Now let's evaluate the options: (i). the interaction between abiotic factors - This option refers to the interaction between non-living factors, which is not applicable in this case, as lichens are living organisms. (ii). the effects of chemical weathering - This option discusses the chemical changes that result in decomposition or disintegration of rock material. Since lichens secrete acids that break down rock surfaces, this option aligns with the given scenario. (iii). the process of deposition - Deposition refers to the process of sediment particles settling and accumulating over time. This option is not relevant to the current situation, as the rock is breaking down, not accumulating particles. (iv). the effects of abrasion - Abrasion refers to the physical wearing down of a surface due to friction or impact. In this case, the breakdown is a result of chemical actions, not physical forces.

The director, Owen Martell, proved to be incapable of holding the audience's attention through the entirety of the film, presenting a slow-paced, meandering narrative that never truly managed to find its footing. The story, focusing on a young protagonist attempting to navigate the complexities of a dystopian world, appeared intriguing on the outside but ultimately turned out to be underdeveloped and poorly executed. This can be largely attributed to the weak script, which was ridden with clichés, and the director's lack of vision for how the film should unfold. Consequently, the audience was left grasping for any semblance of meaning or emotional depth within a sea of hollow dialogue and aimless storylines. Furthermore, the cast's performances failed to breathe life into their characters, with wooden acting and unconvincing interactions making it strenuous for viewers to connect or empathize with the protagonists. Notably, the film's supposed star, Emily Westwood, seemed to phone in her performance, making it difficult to engage with her character's journey. The lack of chemistry between Westwood and her counterpart, George Harper, only amplified these issues, making their on-screen romance far from enthralling. One might hope that a film with such a lacking narrative could at least be saved by stunning visuals or engaging action sequences. Sadly, Fading Dreams failed to rise to the challenge in these areas as well. The cinematography was unimaginative and overly reliant on dull, monotonous color palettes, evoking neither the sense of wonder promised by its marketing nor the themes of the dystopic world. And with action scenes that were stale, repetitive, and poorly choreographed, there was little to no excitement to be found. In terms of soundtrack and score, the music choices appeared to be an afterthought – generic, repetitive tunes that failed to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes they accompanied. Complementing the underwhelming visuals and meager characters, the music in Fading Dreams dragged the film further into the abyss of mediocrity. In summary, Fading Dreams is an immensely disappointing film, lacking any outstanding elements that would make it memorable or worthwhile. From the lackluster direction to the poorly executed script, it concludes with a resounding sense of unfulfilled potential. Viewers seeking a truly engaging and thought-provoking cinematic experience would be best served by steering clear of this underwhelming effort."},{"question":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: We liked the idea of the stainless pull out cleaning system.

He says that \\"menopause occurs when menstruation stops occurring, usually in middle adulthood\\" and \\"lupron stops estrogen production causing fibroids to shrink in size and menstruation usually stops\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","response":"Lupron usually brings on a temporary, medically-induced menopause. To understand why this is the best answer, let's break down the hints provided by the teacher. First, the teacher mentions menopause, which is the time in a woman's life when her menstruation stops, typically occurring in middle adulthood. Menopause is characterized by a decrease in hormone levels (especially estrogen and progesterone) that signal the end of a woman's reproductive years. Second, the teacher informs us that Lupron is a medication that stops estrogen production, which can lead to fibroids shrinking in size and menstruation usually ceasing. Lupron (leuprorelin) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. It is often prescribed to treat various conditions related to hormone production and sensitivity, such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and certain cancers. By interfering with hormonal signals, Lupron effectively shuts down the body's production of estrogen and progesterone. When you consider these hints together, it becomes clear that the effects of Lupron are similar to the natural process of menopause. Both involve the cessation of menstruation and a decrease in hormone levels, although Lupron achieves this through medical intervention. Since Lupron stops estrogen production and can lead to menstruation stopping (as in menopause), the best answer to the question is that Lupron usually brings on a temporary, medically-induced menopause. Please note that the effect of Lupron on menstruation and hormone levels is typically temporary, as the medication is usually administered for a few months as a part of a treatment plan. Once the medication is discontinued, the body's hormonal system generally returns to its previous state, with menstruation resuming and hormone levels returning to their normal levels."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\". Schinder and Schwartz call him \\"a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.\\" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's role playing is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics \\"arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section.\\" In a 2014 analysis of 77 \\"top\\" artists' vocal ranges, Bowie was 8th, just behind Christina Aguilera and just ahead of Paul McCartney. In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesizers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (in the Heroes track \\"Moss Garden\\"); thumb piano; drums (on the Heathen track \\"Cactus\\"), and various percussion instruments.

Possible tweet types: Select from the following. I. negative; II. positive;","response":"I will provide you with a detailed explanation for each type - a negative tweet and a positive tweet. I. Negative Tweet: A negative tweet is a message posted on Twitter that expresses a negative or unfavorable opinion or sentiment. It often contains criticism, disapproval, or dissatisfaction about a particular topic, individual, or situation. The primary purpose of a negative tweet is to express discontent, frustration, or disappointment, and it usually seeks to draw attention to an issue or problem. Here is a breakdown of the key elements often found in a negative tweet: 1. Tone: The overall tone of a negative tweet is usually pessimistic, bitter, or irritated. The author may convey their feelings using strong or harsh words, sarcasm, or by emphasizing certain aspects of the issue. 2. Target: Negative tweets are directed towards a specific target, which can be an individual, a group, or a situation. The target is often identified with blame or held accountable for causing the negative emotions expressed in the tweet. 3. Issue or problem: A negative tweet revolves around a particular issue or problem. The tweet may highlight the negative aspects of the issue, emphasize the consequences, or describe the impact on the author or others. 4. Call to Action: Many negative tweets include a call to action, urging their followers or the targeted party to recognize and address the problem or issue. Example of a negative tweet: \\"Disappointed in the recent changes to my favorite app - it's become so complicated! Now I can't even find the features I use most. Fix this mess! 😠 #BringBackTheOldApp\\" II. Positive Tweet: A positive tweet is a message posted on Twitter that communicates a positive or favorable opinion, emotion, or sentiment. It can praise, express joy, show appreciation, or offer support to a particular topic, individual, or situation. The main goal of a positive tweet is to share contentment, admiration, or gratitude and encourage a positive atmosphere within the Twitter community. Here are the key elements often found in a positive tweet: 1. Tone: The overall tone of a positive tweet is optimistic, enthusiastic, and appreciative. The author may use uplifting language, kind words, or even emojis to express their feelings. 2. Target: Positive tweets are directed towards a specific target, which can be an individual, a group, or a situation. The target is typically praised, celebrated, or acknowledged for their efforts, achievements, or positive influence. 3. Focus on positivity: A positive tweet emphasizes the favorable aspects of the target, such as their accomplishments or qualities, and seeks to share and promote these positive attributes with others. 4. Call to Action: Many positive tweets include a call to action, urging followers to join in the appreciation and positivity, or to participate in a related activity, such as trying a new product or attending an event.

Options: - earn money - depression - work overload - stress - sobering Hmmm, let me think.","response":"Returning to work is a multifaceted experience and can result in a combination of outcomes. Among the provided options: 1. Earn money: This is a highly likely result of returning to work, as most people work to earn an income and support themselves financially. Therefore, this option can be considered a likely result. 2. Depression: While it is possible for some people to experience depression due to various factors at work (such as work environment, relationships with colleagues, or job dissatisfaction), it is not a guaranteed outcome for everyone returning to work. Thus, we cannot consider this a likely result for all individuals. 3. Work overload: Returning to work may result in a heavy workload for some individuals, especially if they have been away for an extended period and have tasks to catch up on. However, this is also not a guaranteed outcome for everyone, as workload depends on factors like job position and company policies. 4. Stress: Similar to work overload, stress can be experienced by some individuals returning to work due to various factors, such as adjusting to the work environment, dealing with deadlines, or managing responsibilities. Since not everyone experiences stress when returning to work, we cannot consider this a likely result for all individuals. 5. Sobering: This term does not seem to be directly related to returning to work, as it usually refers to becoming more serious or realistic, often after an event that has prompted reflection or an emotional reaction. In summary, among the given options, \\"earn money\\" is the most likely result of returning to work, as it is a common goal for most individuals seeking employment. Other outcomes, like depression, work overload, and stress, may be experienced by some people but are not guaranteed for everyone."},{"question":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December.

That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

But Judge Guy P. DePhillips was the one making the apology. The teenager had shown up for the fifth time in one week at Queens Family Court for a hearing, but once again there was no court-appointed lawyer to represent him. ''This is a due process violation, no doubt about it,'' Judge DePhillips said, his voice between a plea and a shout. He told the 15-year-old, identified by the court as Arnold M., that the governor and the Legislature owed him a lawyer and had not provided enough money to pay for one. The judge told the boy and his grandparents to return to the courthouse the next day. It was not a unique moment. There have never been enough lawyers in New York to represent the poor in family and criminal courts, as the law requires. And things are getting worse. As of Jan. 1, almost all the 200 or so lawyers in New York City's family courts are refusing new assignments until they get a raise, saying that after 15 years without a pay increase they can no longer afford the work. The court-appointed lawyers are typically sole practitioners who are certified to take cases in either Criminal or Family Court. The criminal defense lawyers are still taking new cases, but they are also in critically short supply; the number signed up has dropped by more than half in the last decade. In the family courts, Judge DePhillips and others say the work stoppage is paralyzing an already lumbering system and is chronically failing a constituency it is supposed to serve, people who cannot afford their own lawyers. Parents accused of abusing or neglecting their children are legally entitled to a hearing within three days, but must often wait longer; their children, meanwhile, are kept in foster care. Some juveniles charged with crimes are not being given the arraignment hearings they are entitled to; until they get lawyers, they may be held in detention centers or group homes. And domestic-violence cases are left to their own perilous courses. ''It's an abomination,'' said Judge Mary Ellen Fitzmaurice, the supervising judge in Queens Family Court. ''It's unconstitutional.'' On Friday, Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders announced that they had agreed to raise counsel fees this year, though they did not say by how much, and that they were forming a committee to write legislation. Many judges freely attribute the court crisis to lawmakers in Albany, who have not raised the lawyers' rates since 1986. Paying 25 an hour for out-of-court work and 40 an hour in court, New York ranks 49th among the states. (No. 50 is New Jersey, which relies much less on appointed counsel.) The lawyers, stung when the governor's office said last month that their job action would ''hold children hostage,'' are skeptical that the proposed raise will materialize soon. Legislation to raise fees has died regularly in committee. Gary Schultz, a Family Court lawyer in Manhattan who went to Albany yesterday on a quick lobbying trip, said last night that he was reassured by legislative staff members that the raise would be given. But he said they had talked about legislation this year and an appropriation next year, meaning an effective date of Jan. 1, 2003. ''You're talking two years from now,'' he said. ''That's ridiculous.'' In his statement, Mr. Pataki said that while the committee was working on a proposal, the lawyers must ''continue to take new cases and provide adequate representation to children and families who need it.'' The indigent, while not precisely defined, account for most of the 230,000 Family Court cases filed in New York City each year. Generally, the Legal Aid Society represents children, including most in delinquency cases, and the court-appointed lawyers represent adults. In 1998, the last year for which figures are available, 9,765 cases were referred to court-appointed lawyers in the Bronx and Manhattan; Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island did not report figures. No one is counting the new cases put off, but judges and lawyers say almost none requiring assigned counsel are going forward. The lawyers point out that the delays are not new. Last year, court officials estimated that 50 to 100 cases a day were being adjourned for lack of lawyers, and in a survey of Family Court litigants by the public advocate's office, 31 percent said they were not assigned a lawyer on their first day in court. Even the best day in Family Court makes Criminal Court look decorous. Judges are always casting about for lawyers to take cases, and for lawyers who have not shown up to meet clients because they were grabbed for emergencies. The lawyers, those from the Legal Aid Society and the city as well as the appointed counsel, have as many as 100 cases at a time. The lawyers say that for years, none of that moved the Legislature or the governor, who until last week turned aside proposals to increase the fees. ''Remember who we represent,'' said Toba Beth Stutz, the president of the assigned counsel association in Queens. ''They don't make campaign contributions.'' What are the most important parts of this text?","response":"This story is about a problem happening in New York where there are not enough lawyers to help poor people for free in family and criminal courts, as required by law. Due to low pay rates, many lawyers are not taking new cases until they get more money. This situation is causing delays in the courts and making it hard for people who cannot afford their own lawyers. The government is agreeing to raise lawyers' fees this year, but it is not clear how much or when this will happen.

What is a good title for this?","response":"\\"Rafiq Hariri's Lebanese Premiership Ends as Cabinet Resigns Amidst Prolonged Political Turbulence\\" In creating this title, the aim is to capture four key elements of the information: the main subject, Rafiq Hariri, the significant event, the resignation, the people who were involved, i.e., the cabinet and the context, which is the ongoing political uncertainty. The above title does all this concisely. \\"Rafiq Hariri's Lebanese Premiership\\" directly identifies the individual and the position that is central to the event, immediately providing readers information on who is the focus of the news. The term \\"Ends\\" signifies the culmination or completion, implying a change or transformation, which in this case, is Hariri's resignation. Next, the term \\"Cabinet Resigns\\" is included to widen the scope of the event, indicating that this event is not unilateral but involves other political figures. It provides the dimension that it's not just Hariri alone but his whole cabinet, which is a significant wrench in the usual operation of the government. \\"Amidst Prolonged Political Turbulence\\" provides the context or environment surrounding this event. The attribute \\"Prolonged\\" signals that the political challenges have continued for a lengthy period, while \\"Political Turbulence\\" encapsulates the tensions, conflicts or crises within the nation's political realm. Thus, this phrase wraps up the title by letting the reader know the wider circumstances leading to the resignation. In this way, the proposed title delivers a succinct summary, capturing person, event, other parties involved and the broader circumstances in a comprehensive, yet brief introduction."},{"question":"Are the following two questions the same? What has better compression, ZIP or RAR? How do I extract or unzip or unrar a password protected zip or rar file?","response":"No, little buddy, those are two different questions. Let me explain them to you: 1. What has better compression, ZIP or RAR? This question is asking which one, ZIP or RAR, can make files smaller when we squish them together. Imagine you have a big fluffy teddy bear and you want to put it in a small box. Compression is like finding the best way to squish the teddy bear into that box. ZIP and RAR are like different ways of squishing the teddy bear. Some teddy bears might fit better using the ZIP way, while others might fit better using the RAR way. Usually, RAR can squish things a bit more than ZIP. 2. How do I extract or unzip or unrar a password protected zip or rar file? This question is about opening up a squished package that is locked with a secret code. Imagine that teddy bear you squished into the box earlier, but now, the box has a lock on it. We need a special key (password) to open it. So, this question is asking how to use that key to open the locked box and take the teddy bear out without squishing it. To do this, you would need a special tool (a software) on your computer to open those locked ZIP or RAR files, and of course, the secret key (password) to unlock it. I hope that helps you understand the difference between these two questions, my little friend!"},{"question":"Question: Which rank in the Army equates to a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy?

He was the only child of Charles Vaughn Meader, a millworker, and Mary Ellen Abbott. After his father broke his neck and drowned in a diving accident when Meader was only eighteen months old, his mother moved to Boston to work as a cocktail waitress, leaving Meader behind with relatives. A sometimes unruly and troubled child, Meader was sent to live with his mother in Boston at the age of five Context: On October 22, 1962, Meader joined writers Bob Booker and Earle Doud and a small cast of entertainers to record The First Family. The album poked fun at Kennedy's PT-109 history; the rocking chairs he used for his back pain; the Kennedy family's well-known athleticism, football games and family togetherness; children in the White House; and Jackie Kennedy's soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the White House. The First Family became the fastest-selling record in the history of the United States. It sold 1.2 million copies during the first two weeks of its release, and ultimately sold 7.5 million copies. Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \\"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\\" At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \\"annoyment [sic] or enjoyment.\\" He jokingly responded, \\"I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me. So, now he's annoyed.\\" Kennedy told Benjamin Bradlee that \\"parts of it were amusing.\\" Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves' A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy, state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television. Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in Time and Life magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show, The Jack Paar Program, The Andy Williams Show and Hootenanny. Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful (Billboard reported that he \\"bombed\\" in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia), he still played to packed houses in Las Vegas. The First Family won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, The First Family Volume Two, a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President's family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies. In July 1963, Meader left Cadence Records and Booker/Dowd to sign with MGM Records. Meader planned to record general satire and abandon his JFK impersonations. Question: How long did the show last? Answer:","response":"There is no specific mention of a show in the provided context. The context talks about various appearances Vaughn Meader made on television variety shows and the success of his comedy albums \\"The First Family\\" and \\"The First Family Volume Two.\\" However, it does not provide information about the duration of a particular show."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed \\"a rocking throne\\", and tried \\"to make it steady again\\". He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded.

Movie plot title: Babes in Toyland Movie plot: Lisa Piper (Drew Barrymore), an eleven-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio, takes care of her siblings and cooks for her family. She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

Do you want to know about the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic? That's a long name, isn't it? Well, let me tell you something about it! Long, long ago, in a big country called Russia, people got together and decided to create a new way of living called the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or RSFSR for short. It started in the year 1917 when the people over there had a big, important event called the October Revolution. This is when some people, called the Bolsheviks, took control of the government because they wanted to make things more equal for everyone. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was a part of a bigger family, which was called the Soviet Union. They were like the big brother in the family, and they had other members, like Ukraine, Belarus, and many others. During the time when the RSFSR existed, they tried to make a better life for the people, but things didn't always go as planned. There were some really hard times, like wars and famines, where people struggled a lot. Eventually, in 1991, the Soviet Union and all its republics, including the RSFSR, broke apart into separate countries, leaving the big brother to become what we know today as Russia. And that's a little bit about the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic! I hope you found it interesting, little buddy!"},{"question":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous","response":"To determine whether the phrase is positive or negative, let's analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the key words in the phrase. Key words in this phrase are \\"muy loco\\" (very crazy) and \\"no more ridiculous.\\" Step 2: Understand the meanings of each key word and their connotations. \\"Muy loco\\" has a negative connotation as it refers to something being very crazy, which often indicates an unfavorable or out of control situation. However, depending on the context, it can also have a positive or humorous connotation if referring to something fun and wild. \\"No more ridiculous\\" implies that something is not any more absurd than something else. This part of the phrase has a neutral connotation as it is making a comparison and does not explicitly label something as good or bad. Step 3: Evaluate the overall tone of the phrase. Considering both parts of the phrase, the overall tone appears to be neutral leaning towards slightly negative. The use of \\"muy loco\\" suggests a potentially negative view of a situation. However, the addition of \\"no more ridiculous\\" softens the negativity as it implies that the situation is not entirely absurd. In conclusion, this phrase can be seen as neutral to slightly negative, but the context in which it is used may impact the interpretation."},{"question":"Premise: \\"The hands that had grabbed me belonged to a little man.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The giant man touched me.\\" true?","response":"The task is to analyze the given premise and verify if the hypothesis \\"The giant man touched me\\" is true. Step 1: Understand the premise. The premise specifies that \\"The hands that had grabbed me belonged to a little man.\\" Step 2: Define the major components within the premise. These are \\"hands\\", \\"grabbed\\", and \\"little man.\\" Step 3: Understand the hypothesis. The hypothesis states \\"The giant man touched me.\\" Step 4: Define the major components within the hypothesis. These are \\"giant man\\" and \\"touched\\". Step 5: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. It can be seen that the premise talks about \\"a little man\\" whereas the hypothesis mentions \\"a giant man.\\" Considering these phrases likely refer to the size or stature of the man, these two descriptions are opposites. Step 6: Determine if the change in the description is significant. In this case, the difference between \\"little\\" and \\"giant\\" is significant - they are complete opposites. So, based on these steps, the hypothesis \\"The giant man touched me\\" is false based on the given premise \\"The hands that had grabbed me belonged to a little man.\\" The misalignment between the size of the man in the premise and hypothesis warrants this conclusion."},{"question":"What is someone doing to the other party when hurting someone else?

This increased their determination. On their first possession, they came within field goal range on 4th and 1, and decided to attempt to convert, which failed. But on their next possession, Ray Rice scored a touchdown for a 7-0 lead. Billy Cundiff missed two moderate field goals in the first half, but toward the end, made one that increased the lead to 10-0. The Browns forced a fumble in the third quarter and capitalized on it with a field goal, cutting this lead to 10-3. But on the ensuing drive, Ray Rice, who rushed for over 200 yards in the entire game, had a 67-yard gain which led to a touchdown, increasing the lead to 17-3. They would later add to that cushion when Lardarius Webb returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown. The Browns made one more touchdown, making what would be the final score of 24-10. But when the Ravens got their final possession, following the 2-minute warning, they were able to run out the clock as they won their 7th-straight game over the Browns and improved to 9-3. Answer this question based on the article: How many field goals were attempted in the first half?","response":"Based on the article, there were three field goals attempted in the first half. This inference can be made from the information given that during the Ravens' first possession, they were within field goal range but decided to attempt to convert on 4th and 1, which failed. This first attempt is assumed to be a field goal attempt since they were within range. Then, the text further describes that Billy Cundiff missed two moderate field goals in the first half. So, when these two missed attempts by Cundiff are added to the initial failed attempt by the team in their first possession, it can be concluded that there were a total of three field goal attempts in the first half."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Gujarati language or English language.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. Question: \\"In addition to repairing 150 miles of airport runways, what other impact would this plan have on air traffic?\\" Answer: \\"It would reduce travel time\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPTIONS: A. no B. yes","response":"B. yes"},{"question":"First question: How safe is South Africa and, in particular, Johannesburg? Second question: Is it safe for a white American to go to South Africa? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: - no. - yes.","response":"In order to provide a comprehensive answer, I will address each question individually, though they share similarities. First question: How safe is South Africa and, in particular, Johannesburg? South Africa is a diverse country with a rich culture and stunning landscapes. However, the general safety situation can be challenging, particularly in urban areas. In terms of crime rates, South Africa ranks fairly high, with Johannesburg being one of its largest cities and an area where safety concerns are most relevant. While crime can be an issue in South Africa, it is important to understand that the extent of crime varies depending on the location and circumstances. Tourist attractions, well-traveled areas, and affluent neighborhoods tend to be safer in comparison to other regions. Nonetheless, crime can still happen in these areas, so it is essential always to remain cautious and vigilant. Johannesburg, specifically, is a bustling city that offers a mix of pleasant experiences and potential risks. As mentioned before, certain neighborhoods and areas are considered to be safer than others. For instance, areas like Sandton, Rosebank, and Melrose Arch are more secure due to the concentration of business centers, shopping malls, and tourist attractions. On the other hand, downtown Johannesburg, Soweto, and Alexandra township are areas where crime rates tend to be higher, and visitors are advised to exercise considerable caution or avoid these areas altogether. Second question: Is it safe for a white American to go to South Africa? Yes, it can be safe for a white American to visit South Africa, provided they take standard precautions to ensure their safety, regardless of the color of their skin. South Africa is a multicultural, diverse country, and generally, visitors of all ethnicities are welcome. However, the safety tips shared here apply to everyone, regardless of their background. Some general safety tips for travelers visiting South Africa include: 1. Do thorough research on the areas you intend to visit, and prioritize regions with lower crime rates. 2. Stay in reputable hotels or lodgings with good security measures in place. 3. Keep your belongings secure, avoid displaying large amounts of cash or expensive items, as these can make you a target for thieves. 4. Be cautious when walking alone, especially in unfamiliar areas or at night. 5. Use reputable transportation options, like registered taxis or ride-hailing services like Uber. 6. Avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself by wearing flashy clothes or jewelry. 7. Keep your travel plans and itinerary private, and do not share too much information with strangers. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While both questions are related to safety in South Africa, they are not asking the same thing. The first question addresses the general safety situation in the country, with a focus on Johannesburg, while the second question specifically asks about the safety of a white American visiting South Africa. Both answers emphasize the importance of personal discretion and taking the necessary precautions to ensure a safe and memorable trip to South Africa."},{"question":"Answer the following question: \\"St. Thomas Seminary\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Starkey was living in Mexico at the time, when Mackelway brought him back to America in the trunk of his car. Starkey was eventually set free upon the world. Mackelway arrives in Albuquerque, and his first case is the murder of a traveling salesman, Harold Speck, who has a zero mark on his body. The FBI was called to the scene, because the body was in a car located just across the state line. Soon afterwards, he investigates two other murders. Raymond Starkey was the third victim. All the victims had the same zero mark on their body.At first, the murders looked random, and then Mackelway begins to connect the dots. The victims are all serial killers, and someone is going around killing them. He gets a lead that Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) may have some connection to the murders, and he begins to track down O'Ryan. He finds out that O'Ryan was once an FBI agent with special skills, trained to use 'remote viewing' to see what the serial killer sees.

Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \\"coincidental\\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosué, and run a bookstore. When World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosué are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers., can you guess it ?

Options: - college campus - mall - big city - behind the garage. - chicago Hmmm, let me think.","response":"Students are most likely to utilize a parking structure on a college campus. College campuses often have limited parking spaces due to the large number of students, faculty, and staff. Parking structures are built to accommodate a high volume of vehicles within a relatively small footprint. They are multi-story buildings that usually require a parking permit or fee to enter, and they can be quite close to campus buildings and lecture halls. While students could also use parking structures in malls, big cities, or urban areas such as Chicago, these parking facilities are typically not designed specifically for students or associated with educational facilities. Additionally, using a parking spot behind a garage is likely a private or residential area and not a common parking facility for students."},{"question":"Premise: \\"See accompanying notes to the financial statement for the reporting of condition of Heritage Assets.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Checking the accompanying notes to the financial statement makes the reporting of the condition of Heritage Assets much easier and clearer.\\"?","response":"Okay, imagine you have a big coloring book, and the coloring book is like the financial statement.

The premise tells us that it's important to look at these extra pages (accompanying notes) so we understand the condition of the special toys (Heritage Assets) in the coloring book (financial statement). Now, the hypothesis is like asking if checking these extra pages (accompanying notes) will make coloring the special toys (Heritage Assets) much easier and clearer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: A man is trying to escape from the titular Cube. Upon entering a trapped room, he is sprayed with a liquid that rapidly melts his entire body. The rooms in the Cube are being monitored from a remote observation room by two technicians, Eric Wynn and Dodd, who are unaware of who their employers are. The pair are shown playing chess during work, whereupon Wynn demonstrates mental calculator abilities which he uses to predict Dodd's moves. Wynn has also a hobby of drawing comics that portray him and Dodd as superheroes. Wynn and Dodd are ordered to record the dream of a subject, Cassandra Rains.

However, Haskell, like everyone else, only knows his own name and has no recollection of his former life or how he got there. According to what Wynn and Dodd know, everyone in the Cube faced a death sentence and volunteered to partake in psychological experiments instead.

With the stronger dollar, I think people are going to be focused on smaller stocks and American stocks this year. Look at 2014 and you see how the S&P dramatically outperformed the smaller cap stocks. I think there’s a little bit of catch up to be had in 2015. So our focus is on smaller cap stocks that are dominating a particular niche and trade at reasonable multiples as it relates to their growth. If we can find these diamonds in the rough, we think that we’ll make money for our clients over the long run. One of the stocks that we like is a company called LKQ Corp. (NASDAQ: LKQ). It stands for Like in Kind and Quality. It’s about an 8.8 billion market cap company. They basically supply refurbished and recycled auto parts, mostly to body shops, that are identical to new parts, but they’re about 20% to 50% cheaper. Most body shops are funded by insurance companies, and most insurance companies are trying to keep the cost as low as possible, and fix the car as fast as possible to make their customers happy. The other nice thing about LKQ is they’ve got such a vast distribution network that they even consider themselves a logistics company that just happens to be in the auto parts business. So if they can get that part to the body shop one day faster, that’s one day less that insurance has to pay for that rental car. So the insurance companies just love LKQ. They really do dominate their niche, and they’re the only national player. They’re about 20 times the size of their closest competitor. They’re going to start acquiring businesses in Europe, and we think that’s going to be a good part of their growth going forward. It trades at about 17 times earnings and it’s growing about 18% per year. We think it’s going to be a really good stock over the next two to three years — which is really our time horizon when we look at particular businesses. Forbes: That certainly sounds very interesting. Villere: Another company that we like is DST Systems Inc. (NYSE: DST).

It is led by members of the British West Indian community, and attracts around one million people annually, making it one of the world's largest street festivals, and a significant event in British culture. In 2006, the UK public voted it onto the list of icons of England. Despite its name, it is not part of the global Carnival season preceding Lent. - The Elim Pentecostal Church is a UK-based Pentecostal Christian denomination. - Portobello Road is a street in the Notting Hill district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from south to north, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London's notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road. - Kensington Temple is a large Pentecostal church in the Notting Hill area of London , England . It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church . - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market. - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

I found from multiple reliable sources that US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had been diagnosed with polio, which caused paralysis and made him use a wheelchair. Polio is a viral disease that can result in paralysis by attacking the nervous system. It can impair a person's ability to move, which would explain Roosevelt's need for a wheelchair. His diagnosis was in the early 20th century, which was before major medical advancements and the invention of a vaccine for the disease. This is verified by several historical records and wouldn't be considered a subject of major dispute. Therefore, we can confidently state that Franklin D.

Is \\"Because of the limited populations that each component captures, consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings.\\" the correct answer?","response":"Without knowing the content and context of the talk, it is impossible to confirm whether that is the correct answer. However, I can provide a detailed and well-structured response based on the statement you provided. The given statement, \\"Because of the limited populations that each component captures, consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings,\\" suggests that the issue being addressed by Savin during the talk could potentially be related to the limitations of research methodologies, sampling strategies, and the generalizability of the research findings. 1. Limitations of research methodologies: Different research methodologies have their unique strengths and limitations. Savin might have discussed how selecting inappropriate methods to collect data might impact the validity and reliability of the research findings. For instance, using self-reporting surveys could introduce social desirability bias, while utilizing naturalistic observation might lead to observer bias. 2. Sampling strategies: When conducting research, it is critical to select a representative sample of the population to ensure the findings can be generalized to the broader population. It is possible that Savin discussed issues related to sample selection, such as biased or insufficient sample sizes, non-probability sampling techniques, and their potential effect on the generalizability of the study conclusions. 3. Generalizability of research findings: Generalizability refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to other contexts, individuals, and settings beyond the research scope. During the talk, Savin could have emphasized the need for caution when attempting to generalize research findings to different populations, especially when the study has a limited sample size or when the population is not sufficiently representative of the broader population in question. 4. Responsibility of consumers of research: Savin may have highlighted the role of consumers of research, such as researchers, policymakers, and individuals, in critically evaluating research findings. This includes understanding the methodology, examining the validity of the data, interpreting the conclusions appropriately, and being cautious in generalizing findings without considering the context, limitations, and potential biases. In conclusion, based on the provided statement, the issues that Savin might have addressed in their talk could involve discussing the limitations and challenges involved in research methodologies, sampling strategies, and the generalizability of research findings. Also, the statement suggests that Savin may have emphasized the responsibility of research consumers to critically evaluate and utilize research findings with caution. Nonetheless, without additional context and information about the talk, this answer remains speculative."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Position yourself directly between and beneath the rings. You should be able to lift your arms straight up with your elbows slightly bent when reaching for the rings. Unlike muscle-ups performed on the bar, you don't need to start with your body at an angle to build up starting momentum. Since the rings are flexible instead of rigid, it should naturally be easier to lift your upper body even without the extra swing. It should be noted that performing a muscle-up on rings is more difficult than on the bar. While it’s easier to gain momentum, the rings aren’t stable. Because the rings move it will require you to have more control over your body. Raise your arms and grab both rings, using a false grip instead of a normal grip. If you're unfamiliar with the false grip, you may wish to practice it before attempting to perform a muscle-up. This grip is important because it removes your thumb and wrist joint from the equation and makes it easier to raise your body higher and transition between motions. To grab the rings with a false grip, rest your wrists on the rings and flex your hands down toward your elbows and pinky fingers. Gradually straighten out your arms and kick your feet out in front of you. You should hang from the rings, relying on your arms alone to support your weight. Note that your hands should be above your head and spread apart at approximately shoulder-width. When using the false grip, it may not be possible for you to completely straighten out your arms. Still, you should try to straighten out your arms as much as possible to make the next step easier. Use your arms to pull your body up until your chin is at the same level or slightly above the bottom portion of the rings. As you lift your body up, you should try to draw the rings inward. Draw the rings in close together and close to your chest and body. You may have to point your elbows out to counter the balance of the rings. Lean back just enough so that your face moves behind the rings instead of between. Your head will need to be behind the rings so that you can create enough space and momentum to transition to your dip. As soon as you feel steady enough, lean your shoulders and chest forward. Your shoulders should feel as though each one is rolling over the top of each ring. During this step, you need to get your shoulders completely over the rings. Doing so will allow you to position more of your weight above the rings, making it easier for you to transition into a full muscle-up. Theoretically, you could pull your shoulders straight above the rings by relying on arm strength alone. But, you need to lean forward so that your weight sits over your hands. Otherwise, you will probably sink back down before completing the muscle-up. As you pull your shoulders above the rings, you'll need to start turning the rings to the outside. Your hands will naturally spread apart to shoulder-width, but do not allow your hands to spread any further than that. Turn the rings so your fingers are facing outward. Turning the rings allows you to lift your body up. While you lift your upper body, you must simultaneously begin pushing your legs down while keeping both fairly straight. You do not need to straighten out your legs completely, however. It’s best to keep your legs slightly bent at the hips so that your feet remain in front of you. Keeping your feet in front of you can help your balance and keep you stable. If you find it difficult to keep your legs straight, you could choose to lift your knees up to rest in front of your lower abdomen. Regardless of whether your legs remain straight or bent, you need to keep your legs slightly in front of you. This makes it easier for the body weight to shift in a way that will allow you to get behind and over the rings. Use your hands to push down on the rings. Continue doing so until your entire chest and upper arms are above the height of the rings. Once you reach this peak, you've completed a full muscle-up. Your arms should start straightening out but will remain slightly bent at the elbow. Keep your hands apart at approximately shoulder-width. Note that your chest will also straighten out some, but your shoulders and upper chest should still lean slightly forward. Try to keep your spine straight. You don’t want to allow your spine to curve. Curving your spine prevents you from correctly engaging and building your muscles. Keep your core engaged as well. As you pull into this position, your legs will naturally drop straight down beneath the rest of your body. Summary:","response":"This article provides detailed instructions on how to perform a muscle-up on rings, emphasizing the importance of positioning, false grip, body control, and balance throughout the exercise."},{"question":"Q:In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors.

Answer:","response":"Title: Extremely Disappointed with the App Review: I recently downloaded com.google.android.gms, but I soon discovered that it is far from being a satisfactory experience. To be honest, I am absolutely appalled by how many issues this app has. First and foremost, the overall performance of the app is excruciatingly slow. It constantly lags when I attempt to navigate through it, making even the simplest tasks difficult to achieve. Loading times are unbearable, and I often find myself frustrated when trying to use its features. Secondly, the frequent crashes are another glaring issue with this app. It seems like I can't use the app for more than a few minutes before it suddenly crashes without warning. This is incredibly annoying as I have to continually relaunch the app, only for it to crash again within a short period. Additionally, the app has a rather confusing and poorly designed user interface. Navigating through the app is cumbersome, and I often find myself lost, unable to find the functions I need. The layout and design are unappealing, making it difficult to locate the required settings or information. Lastly, it feels as if there is practically zero customer support. I tried reaching out for assistance to resolve the issues I've encountered, but it appears that the support team is either unresponsive or simply nonexistent. This absence of help only exacerbates the feeling of frustration when using this app. In conclusion, com.google.android.gms has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated with its numerous issues, slow performance, and lack of support. I would not recommend this app to anyone, and I sincerely hope that the developers take the time to address and resolve these pressing concerns. As it stands, I am forced to give this app a 1-star rating."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: Where does Hondo get into a fight with a stranger? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Hondo Context: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \\"Hondo\\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.

Article: When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called \\"Brownie\\". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around. One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, \\"Bad girl,\\" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes. Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone. Question: Which of the following best describes Brownie?

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh.

Allow yourself forgiveness, and see what you can learn from your mistakes. You can’t change the past, but you can learn valuable lessons from it. Tell yourself how great it is that you’ve learned something new and can change the way you do things in the future. If you remember certain times that you acted in an attention-seeking way in the past, forgive yourself for those things, too. The fact that you can acknowledge those behaviors means you can work to prevent them in the future. Talk to yourself kindly, the way that you would to a friend having a difficult time. Say to yourself, \\"I know I messed up that time, but I was doing my best in the moment. Everyone messes up sometimes. It's okay, and I'll try to do things differently next time.\\" Choose ways that you want to practice being authentic each day. This can mean doing something that you enjoy by yourself, or reciting an important affirmation to yourself. Practice being yourself and acting in a way that feels genuine, without worrying what people will think. You can make a practice of doing one thing each day, when you feel that you’re being true to how you feel in the moment. This could mean saying something honest that you haven't before, such as, \\"Actually, I don't like going to that cafe very much.\\" It can also mean doing something differently, such as wearing an outfit that's comfortable, even if it's not stylish. You can develop personal affirmations to help you accept yourself. You can say something like, “I am a valuable, lovable person the way that I am,” or, “I accept and love all aspects of myself even as I work to grow and change.” Mindfulness refers to trying to stay present wherever you are, without getting lost in thoughts or feelings that take you out of the moment. Mindfulness is most often practiced through meditation techniques. However, there are many ways to practice mindfulness. You can find books or websites that offer meditation techniques, or visit a meditation center to find guidance on how to begin meditating. You can also use an app, such as Insight Timer, Calm, or Headspace. If meditating isn’t right for you, practice mindfulness by noticing the physical sensations you’re experiencing. If you start to get distracted by guilt, shame, or unpleasant memories, just notice the feeling of your clothes on your skin, or your feet on the ground. It is almost impossible to make a change in ourselves if we don’t consciously commit to doing so. If you want to change or eliminate your attention-seeking behavior, make a commitment to do so, and to take specific steps toward that goal. Write down your commitment. You can put it on a calendar, marking the day you commit to start working on it. Write down daily or weekly goals, such as, “I will meditate for five minutes each day,” or, “Each week, I will volunteer 5 hours of my time to a charitable cause.” Tell someone else about your commitment. Tell a trusted friend or family member. They can check in on you to see if you’ve followed through on your commitments. If you're an attention seeker, you probably try to spend lots of time with other people. Practice spending time by yourself, too. Set a goal for how much time you'll spend alone each day or week. When you're alone, do things that you enjoy. This will help being alone feel more fun and enticing. You can read your favorite books and magazines, walk around your favorite park or neighborhood, or dedicate time to a favorite hobby. It may be uncomfortable to spend time alone at first. However, push through that discomfort and you'll begin to cherish the time you get by yourself. Identifying why you're seeking attention can help you confront the root cause of your behaviors. For example, you may have a feeling of inadequacy, you may have trouble being alone, or you may feel like you aren't doing enough with your life. Confronting these issues will help you overcome your attention seeking tendencies. Journaling can help you explore your feelings. You can also talk to a therapist who can help you identify your underlying issues. Summary:","response":"Dwelling on past mistakes can be harmful, so it's crucial to forgive ourselves and learn from these experiences. Acknowledging past attention-seeking behaviors and practicing self-compassion will allow for personal growth and change. To be more authentic, engage in activities that feel genuine and true to yourself, and practice daily affirmations to boost self-acceptance. Mindfulness, often practiced through meditation, can help in staying present and focused, while committing to change and setting specific goals will aid in overcoming attention-seeking habits. Spending time alone, engaging in enjoyable activities, and understanding the roots of attention-seeking behaviors can contribute to personal development and improved self-knowledge. Seeking guidance from resources such as books, websites, or therapists can be beneficial in working through these issues."},{"question":"Question: Process: - Get the ice tray - Remove any ice cubes currently in the tray - Fill the tray with cold water - Ensure the tray is evenly filled to an appropriate level - Open the freezer - Place the tray in the freezer - Close the freezer door - Wait. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose at the Equator happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you've mentioned refers to a situation where the ice tray is placed at the Equator. In this scenario, we need to consider several factors, such as temperature, humidity, and environment, to understand its potential effect on ice cube production. At the Equator, the climate is generally warmer than other areas on Earth due to the direct sunlight it receives throughout the year. This can indirectly affect the process of making ice cubes in a couple of ways: 1. Increased Energy Consumption: Since the ambient temperature is higher at the Equator, freezers would have to work harder to maintain the desired freezing temperature. This might lead to increased energy consumption and, in some cases, reduced efficiency in ice cube production. 2. Increased Freezing Time: It could take a longer time for the water to freeze into ice cubes due to the higher ambient temperature. Consequently, the overall process of making ice cubes may be slower at the Equator compared to other regions with cooler climates. 3. Condensation and Humidity: In warmer climates, especially those with higher humidity levels, moisture from the air may condense on the ice tray, potentially leading to excess water in the tray and affecting the shape and quantity of ice cubes formed. Although these factors can have an indirect effect on ice cube production, following the outlined process and maintaining ideal freezing conditions in your freezer should result in making an appropriate amount of ice cubes regardless of location."},{"question":"Given the following context: Wedge Donovan is a tough construction boss, building airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy during World War II. He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the Japanese. When the enemy lands in force on the island, he finally takes matters into his own hands, leading his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.

Based on the given information, John might feel relieved once he finished buying presents as the stress would be gone. b. Happiness: The situation doesn't specify if John gets any joy or happiness from the act of giving presents, so we cannot assume he would feel happiness. c. Very sad: There is no indication of sadness related to John buying presents or finishing the task. It only states that he is stressed. d.

Dr. Severino Antinori, who is head of a hospital in Rome, has been referred to in an Arab newspaper claiming that one of his parents is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned baby. Antinori refused to comment on the reports, but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo for implantation with two years. So far seven different kinds of animals have already successfully been cloned, including sheep, cats and most recently rabbits. Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admitted that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a worldwide ban on the practice. Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, \\"I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby. It is using humans as guinea pigs . It makes people feel sick.\\" But Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute at Darmouth College in the USA, said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth. So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders, many of them dying soon after their birth.

Tammy Van Dyke, of Apple Valley, sued Allina Health System's Abbott Northwestern Hospital late last week. The suit said the Dec. 5, 2012, mix-up led to \\"unnecessary medical treatment, tests and expenses, and severe mental injury and emotional pain and suffering.\\" In response, Abbott acknowledged the mistake, saying it appears the staff failed to follow procedure of matching codes on the infants' and mothers' identification bands. Two months later, Abbott instituted a new procedure using higher-tech identification bands to avoid further mix-ups. \\"We began using electronic identification bands for the mother and infant that must be matched when returning the infant to the mother,\\" said Michelle Smith, who oversees Abbott's Mother Baby Center. \\"This helps us to assure that the identity of the infant and mother are matched each time.\\" The new system displays a green light to tell the nurse that the mother and baby match. Allina spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said Tuesday she's unaware of any such mix-up occurring at Abbott since the electronic bands started being used. Van Dyke gave birth to son Cody Stepp on Dec. 3, 2012, and the boy was handed over to another mother in the center and breast-fed, the suit said. Cody was wearing three hospital ID bracelets with the proper identification on his ankle, according to his mother. A few days after the late-night mistake, Van Dyke said that Cody and the other woman, who had given birth to twins, were given blood tests to make sure they were not exposed to any infectious diseases, such as hepatitis or HIV, that can be transmitted through breast milk. All the tests were negative, she said — but Cody had retesting scheduled every three months for a year. The suit seeks more than 50,000 and whatever other compensation a court might find proper for Van Dyke. Her attorney, Wayne Jagow, declined to discuss specific facts of the case, but said they decided to sue after negotiations for a settlement failed. \\"My client had no desire to bring herself into the limelight again by starting a lawsuit, but really had no choice as our statute of limitations was up,\\" Jagow said in an e-mail. \\"We had attempted to get some sort of dialogue going with Abbott/Allina over the last year to handle this quietly and they simply refused.\\" Jagow also said Van Dyke was not told of any changes to procedures to prevent this from happening to other families. \\"This has always been her primary concern,\\" he said. ||||| A newborn baby will have to undergo a year of medical tests for HIV and hepatitis because he was accidentally put in the wrong bassinet by a Minneapolis hospital and then breastfed by the wrong mother. The mix-up happened Wednesday in Abbott Northwestern Hospital when Tammy Van Dyke's little boy Cody was accidentally switched to the wrong bassinet in the nursery. \\"You put your baby in the nursery, not even 48-hours old, and you think they're safe,\\" Van Dyke told ABC News today. \\"I'm holding it together. I'm just in disbelief, and it was like I was in a dream, a bad dream, and I couldn't get it to stop.\\" Van Dyke was told two hours after the switch happened, just hours before she was going to take Cody home. The infant had to undergo blood testing for HIV and hepatitis immediately following the switch. \\"It was horrible,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"Two nurses had to go in through veins in his tiny little arms.\\" Although the tests came back negative, Abbott Northwestern Hospital told Van Dyke her newborn son would have to undergo blood testing every three months for a year. Hospital spokeswoman Gloria O'Connell said the tests were \\"just a precaution,\\" but declined to elaborate because of patient confidentiality. Van Dyke was able to speak with the other mother, who had to wait 20 minutes before her baby, Liam, was located. \\"It gave me peace of mind to talk to her,\\" Van Dyke said. \\"She was just as distraught as me that this happened to her, and in the meantime, also didn't know where her baby was.

The mother of the child, Tammy Van Dyke, has sued Allina Health System's Abbott Northwestern Hospital for the mix-up, which led to unnecessary medical treatment, tests, and expenses as well as emotional pain and suffering. The hospital acknowledged the mistake, stating that staff failed to follow the proper procedure of matching codes on infants' and mothers' identification bands. Following the incident, the hospital introduced electronic identification bands to ensure proper matching of babies with their mothers.

Scarpia's apartment in the Palazzo Farnese, that evening Scarpia, at supper, sends a note to Tosca asking her to come to his apartment, anticipating that two of his goals will soon be fulfilled at once. His agent, Spoletta, arrives to report that Angelotti remains at large, but Cavaradossi has been arrested for questioning. He is brought in, and an interrogation ensues. As the painter steadfastly denies knowing anything about Angelotti's escape, Tosca's voice is heard singing a celebratory cantata elsewhere in the Palace. She enters the apartment in time to see Cavaradossi being escorted to an antechamber. All he has time to say is that she mustn't tell them anything. Scarpia then claims she can save her lover from indescribable pain if she reveals Angelotti's hiding place. She resists, but the sound of screams coming through the door eventually breaks her down, and she tells Scarpia to search the well in the garden of Cavaradossi's villa. Scarpia orders his torturers to cease, and the bloodied painter is dragged back in. He's devastated to discover that Tosca has betrayed his friend. Sciarrone, another agent, then enters with news: there was an upset on the battlefield at Marengo, and the French are marching on Rome. Cavaradossi, unable to contain himself, gloats to Scarpia that his rule of terror will soon be at an end. This is enough for the police to consider him guilty, and they haul him away to be shot. Scarpia, now alone with Tosca, proposes a bargain: if she gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be freed. She is revolted, and repeatedly rejects his advances, but she hears the drums outside announcing an execution. As Scarpia awaits her decision, she prays, asking why God has abandoned her in her hour of need: \\"Vissi d'arte\\" (\\"I lived for art\\"). She tries to offer money, but Scarpia isn't interested in that kind of bribe: he wants Tosca herself. Spoletta returns with the news that Angelotti has killed himself upon discovery, and that everything is in place for Cavaradossi's execution. Scarpia...

Mephedrone is commonly known as MCAT."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. The temptation when you rescue an emaciated, or very thin, horse is to feed her a lot to help him regain weight. However, this is not as simple as it sounds because suddenly providing an abundance of food causes digestive problems and is likely to trigger potentially serious health issues such as colic or laminitis. Weight gain has to be mapped out over several months. It must be done carefully and methodically. The ideal food for helping the horse regain weight is forage (good quality hay) and the amount you feed the horse should be the amount recommended for her current body weight, plus 10 or 15%. Use a measuring tape to assess the horse’s current weight, and cross reference this with a body weight-based feeding chart. If you are concerned that you are not feeding the horse the right amount, talk to a vet. After a period of starvation, the horse’s stomach will need to repopulate the good bacteria that aids digestion. Feeding the horse a large meal will put a lot of pressure on the horse’s stomach that could lead to digestion problems. Rather than giving the horse her allotted amount of feed all at once, space the amount of feed you give her out over the course of the day. This will keep the horse from gorging herself. Forage, or good quality hay, is the ideal food for a horse in the initial stages of rehabilitation because it is high in fiber, takes time to chew, and it difficult to bolt down. Bolting a lot of feed quickly can lead to choke, or a blockage of partially chewed, dry food in the esophagus. Alfalfa hay is high in protein and low in carbohydrates, which can help to keep the horse energized. If the horse is eating hay well, increase her daily ration by about one flake a day, and after a week of eating well, consider allowing her free access to hay. Some horses won't eat hay; if this is the case with your horse, try hay cubes or roughage chunks. These can trick the horse into thinking she is eating a concentrate, which will make her more likely to eat. If the horse if having trouble eating because of dental problems (for example, dropping food or drooling) try soaking the hay cubes to soften them. If the horse is not gaining weight on hay, then add beet pulp or rice bran to her diet. Both foods are higher in calories than forage but are also high in fiber. Avoid beet pulp that contains molasses as it will cause a \\"sugar rush\\" or a wash of sugar into the bloodstream that could overexcite your horse. Vegetable oils are an easy way to add calories to your horse’s feed. Most horses will eat 1 to 2 cups (250 ml each) of oil mixed into the food, though some horses may be picky. Try different types of oil, including: Canola, cocosoya, and standard vegetable oil. Although concentrates are high in calories, they are also high in the starches and sugars that trigger metabolic problems such as insulin resistance, colic, and laminitis.","response":"Rescuing an emaciated horse requires careful and methodical weight gain through feeding forage and avoiding large meals to prevent health issues like colic and laminitis, while monitoring and adjusting the horse's diet based on weight and dental needs, and consulting a vet for guidance."},{"question":"Generate a short movie review that has \\"2).\\" sentiment (Choices: 1). negative. 2). positive.).","response":"Title: \\"The Marvelous Flight\\" \\"The Marvelous Flight\\" is an exhilarating cinematic experience that delivers an absolute delight for moviegoers across the board.

The term \\"static\\" has various meanings, and without context or further elaboration, it's hard to accurately determine the reviewer's sentiment. However, let's analyze the possible interpretations of the word \\"static\\" in the context of a movie review: 1. Lack of movement or development: In this case, the review might suggest that the movie's plot or characters appeared dull, uninteresting, or stagnant. If the reviewer used \\"static\\" to convey this idea, it would indicate a negative opinion of the movie. 2. Unchanging or constant: If the reviewer used \\"static\\" to describe the movie's pace, it could either be positive or negative. Some viewers appreciate a steady pace throughout a film, while others prefer varied dynamics. Therefore, the sentiment cannot be determined unless we understand the reviewer's preference. 3. Interference or noise in the audio or visuals: \\"Static\\" could also refer to technical issues faced during the movie, such as poor sound or visual quality. In this case, the word \\"static\\" would be a criticism of the movie's production quality and would indicate a negative opinion of the film. 4. Unemotional or unresponsive: The word \\"static\\" may also be interpreted as implying that the movie's characters or plot failed to evoke any emotional response from the reviewer. If this was their intended meaning, the review would be negative. In conclusion, from the single-word review \\"static,\\" it is hard to decisively determine whether the opinion is positive or negative without further context or explanation. However, based on the potential interpretations provided, it seems more likely that the review leans towards a negative opinion of the movie, considering the majority of the meanings of \\"static\\" have negative implications in the context of a movie review."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

Analyzing the given text, we can infer the following truths about the narrator's life: 1. They paid their bills: The narrator explicitly mentions, \\"I have bills.\\" While they do not specifically say that they paid their bills, it can be implied that as the sole breadwinner for the family, they would be responsible for ensuring that the bills are paid. This statement showcases the financial obligations they have to fulfill. 2. They have extra responsibility: The statement, \\"I was the only one working in my family,\\" clearly establishes that the narrator bears the burden of not just their own needs but also those of their family members. This additional weight makes their life more challenging and demanding as compared to someone without such an obligation. 3. They had good alternatives: This statement, in fact, is not true. The narrator explicitly mentions that \\"there were no good alternatives available.\\" This lack of appealing options has not only limited their choices but also forced them to make difficult decisions on the spot. 4. They paid their mortgage: Similar to the first statement, while the narrator mentions, \\"I have a mortgage to pay,\\" they do not explicitly state that they paid their mortgage.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow's use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson's voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara's song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara's personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of \\"Tabula Rasa\\". Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy's confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes. Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow's recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most Buffy characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other Buffy characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara's name resembles the Latin terra, meaning \\"earth.\\" She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson's body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara's last words, commenting that Willow's shirt is stained (with Tara's own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others. Tara has also appeared in The Long Way Home, Always Darkest, Retreat, and the one-off Willow.","response":"This text is about Tara Maclay, a fictional character from the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Q: Examples of organ systems in a human include the skeletal, nervous, and what?

This special, long rest in winter is called \\"hibernation\\" for most amphibians.

The first step to solving for 'd' is to simplify the left side. To do so, we will perform the subtraction operation between 4807 and 5192. So we get: -385 = 35*d This simplifies the equation, as it now only has one operation left, which is the division to find the value of 'd'. To isolate the variable on one side and ensure 'd = something', you divide both sides of the equation by 35. Considering that every operation performed on one side of the equation must be performed on the other side as well to maintain the equality, we get: d = -385 / 35 Now, we just need to perform the simple division operation to find the value of 'd'. So, we have: d = -11 So, to summarize: You start with 4807 - 5192 = 35*d. Subtracting the two values on the left gives us -385 = 35*d. Then you isolate 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 35, giving you d = -11. Therefore, the solution to the problem 4807 - 5192 = 35*d is d = -11."},{"question":"Given the question: Would you like to be an actor, but aren't the right age or physical type for the part? Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting. _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \\"voice\\" in acting after all! From the passage we can infer that _ .

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","response":"In this analysis, we will thoroughly examine the given product review and determine if it portrays the product in a flattering or unflattering light. Title: \\"Too high\\" The title itself immediately suggests that the reviewer found the product to be priced higher than they consider acceptable or reasonable. From the title alone, it can be inferred that the reviewer is implying the product's cost was not justified, which reflects an unflattering sentiment towards the product. Product review: \\"After I got done putting this in a frame, I saw it for about the same price with frame at Micheal's, a craft store.\\" The body of the review specifies that the reviewer purchased a product (likely a piece of artwork or printed material) and then bought a separate frame for it. After the reviewer combined the two purchases, they discovered an alternative option available at a craft store called Michael's that offered the product already framed at a similar price. The reviewer may feel that they made an unfavorable decision or wasted effort and resources on acquiring and assembling the separate items. This realization may lead the reviewer to feel negatively about their original purchase, resulting in a feeling that they overpaid for the product they acquired initially. In essence, the reviewer compares two similar products and implies that they could have obtained better value for the same amount of money elsewhere. The reviewer does not comment on the quality, appearance, or performance of the product itself; the content of the review focuses solely on the aspect of cost and how it compares to an alternative option available at a different store. Upon analyzing the title and body of the product review, it is clear that the overall sentiment portrayed is unflattering. The reviewer's main grievance stems from the perception of paying too much for the product when compared to a similar, comparably-priced alternative that already included a frame. This perceived reduction in value ultimately cast the product in an unfavorable light, even though the quality, aesthetics, or performance of the product remains unaddressed in the review."},{"question":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: A train at a stop at a train station.","response":"In the given sentence, \\"A train at a stop at a train station,\\" the keywords are: 1.

She graduated from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and earned a Ph.D. in government from Harvard. She was a senior associate dean for faculty research at the business school, but is on leave this year, working on a book about global markets for water.

In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere.

(Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What will likely happen when the teacher finishes her instructions? Options: - the children will go outside to play - the children will draw their self portrait - not enough information - the children will trace their hands","response":"When the teacher finishes her instructions, the children will likely draw their self-portraits, following the steps and guidance provided by the teacher. The lesson is aimed at helping young children develop self-awareness and spatial awareness through the process of creating self-portraits."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Title: Bad Coding, bad design, poor marketing Review: I was really looking forward to this game, but was very disappointed with it. First, it lagged badly, even in the opening and welcome screens. It would take me 2 minutes just to select campaign. Now, after a graphics driver update, the program doesn't run at all. Apparently, they don't support the ATI X300 or any other graphics card over 1 year old, which is pathetic. I wouldn't mind some lag now and then, knowing my computer isn't a graphics powerhouse, but not running at all is very irritating. In gameplay, the controls are awful. I assumed this was a PC game ported to XBox, when it's the other way around, so they don't take very good advantage of the keyboard. Also, their website claimed you could customize the ship, like in SFC3, but that was also a false claim. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","response":"The product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. The user expresses their disappointment with multiple aspects of the game, including its performance, graphics compatibility, controls, and the false claims made on the developer's website. This negative sentiment is evident through the various issues the user faced, such as lagging, compatibility problems with graphics cards, unsatisfactory keyboard utilization, and lack of customization features as advertised. Firstly, the reviewer highlights the game's performance issues by mentioning the lag in the opening and welcome screens, making it time-consuming to navigate the game menu. This suggests that the game is not well optimized and performing below the user's expectations. Secondly, the reviewer voices their frustration with the game's lack of support for the ATI X300 graphics card and other cards over a year old. This issue renders the game unplayable for the user after updating their graphics driver, which is understandably aggravating. The reviewer deems this level of compatibility as \\"pathetic,\\" emphasizing the severity of their dissatisfaction. Thirdly, the controls are criticized for being subpar and not taking advantage of the keyboard. The reviewer initially thought the game was a PC port for the Xbox due to the poorly executed controls, and the reality that it was the other way around only adds to the confusion and annoyance. Lastly, the reviewer calls out false advertising from the developer's website, claiming that the game enables ship customization in a similar way to what was possible in Starfleet Command 3 (SFC3). The user's inability to find this feature discredits the developer's claim, adding to the negative sentiment. Considering all these aspects, it's clear that the reviewer's experience with the game was overwhelmingly negative, resulting in a poor review that reflects the game's many shortcomings and dissatisfaction with the overall product."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options: - he doesn't read blogs - not enough information - he hates blogs - he likes blogs A:","response":"he likes blogs"},{"question":"Trance is a deep hypnosis.

Should I discourage my teenage son from taking performance-enhancing drugs? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? a). no b). yes","response":"a). no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they ask about different things. The first question is about whether a child should be discouraged from becoming a musician if they are not good-looking, as performers often need to look good. The second question asks whether a teenage son should be discouraged from using performance-enhancing drugs.

Answer:","response":"The sentiment behind the sentence \\"long\\" can be perceived as neutral on its own. The analysis of sentiment requires context, as it allows the AI to determine the meaning behind the phrase. The word \\"long\\" is an adjective that primarily describes the length of something and does not inherently convey a positive or negative connotation. However, it can take on positive or negative meanings depending on the context it is being used in. For example, if it were to be used in a sentence like \\"I had a long and enjoyable conversation with my friend,\\" the sentiment could be perceived as positive. In contrast, a sentence like \\"I had a long and tiring day at work\\" would likely be perceived as having a negative sentiment. In the given options, neither negative nor positive can be confidently attached to the sentiment of the word \\"long\\" without further context. Thus, the answer to the question regarding the sentiment of this sentence would be inconclusive, as the word alone does not provide enough information to determine sentiment accurately."},{"question":"Premise: On this basis, attorney Charles (Rick) Rule, who has been retained to represent Microsoft, accuses DOJ of suing a company with a smaller share of sales in order to protect the ability of its dominant competitor to secure an exclusive. Hypothesis: They were not playing fair. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","response":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first break down the given statement and closely examine both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: Attorney Charles (Rick) Rule accuses the Department of Justice (DOJ) of suing a company (Microsoft) with a smaller share of sales in order to protect the ability of its dominant competitor to secure an exclusive. In this premise, Rule argues that the DOJ's actions in targeting Microsoft, a company with a smaller market share, are aimed at preserving the dominant competitor's market exclusivity. This implies that the DOJ might be favoring the dominant competitor for some reason and is potentially being influenced or biased in its decision-making. Hypothesis: They were not playing fair. The hypothesis suggests that there was unfairness involved in the situation. In the context of the premise, the unfairness would refer to the DOJ's actions in suing Microsoft and possibly favoring the dominant competitor. Now, we must analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise discusses the accusation made by Attorney Charles Rule, who suggests that the DOJ's actions were focused on helping the dominant competitor maintain its market exclusivity. This allegation implies that the DOJ might not be acting fairly or impartially in its decision to sue Microsoft instead of the dominant competitor. In light of this information, we can conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis to a certain extent. The premise implies that the DOJ's actions were biased or influenced, which would support the idea that \\"they were not playing fair.\\" However, it is important to note that the premise only presents an accusation made by Rule, who is representing Microsoft, and does not provide concrete evidence or details to confirm the hypothesis. While the premise and hypothesis are related, further investigation and fact-finding would be necessary to determine whether or not the DOJ's actions were truly unfair. In summary, the premise entails the hypothesis to some extent, as it suggests that the DOJ's actions may have been unfair or biased. However, to fully confirm the hypothesis, more information would be needed."},{"question":"Attributes: name = The Golden Palace, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, customer rating = high, area = city centre.

It was Kyndall Jack's screams that ultimately led to her rescue, officials said Thursday. The 18-year-old, who had been missing in Orange County's Trabuco Canyon since Easter Sunday, was airlifted off a rugged hillside Thursday morning and transported to UCI Medical Center in Orange, officials said. Rescuers reached the woman Thursday morning after a hiker alerted rescue teams of the sounds of a woman screaming near Falls Canyon. Officials said she was about half a mile from where she and a friend, Nicolas Cendoya, parked their car Sunday. Photos: The search for missing hikers “She is responsive, appears to be dehydrated, she is weak,” said Lt. Jason Park of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. “She’s alive, she’s conscious and she’s being transported.” Park described the operation as a difficult rescue because of the steep terrain. One of the volunteer reserve deputies involved in the search for Jack suffered a head injury after a fall and was being taken to another area hospital. Capt. John Muir of the Orange County Fire Authority said that when Jack’s parents were told she had been found, “they cried, they hugged us, they thanked us immensely.\\" \\"This is a good outcome,\\" he told reporters. \\"This is why we do what we do.” Crews had scoured the difficult terrain since Sunday evening, when Cendoya and Jack called authorities on a cellphone and said they were lost. Cendoya, 19, was found dehydrated and disoriented on Wednesday night, about half a mile from the parked car off a gravel road that had been traversed by search crews. Rescuers had to slash through thick brush to get to Cendoya, who was wearing board shorts and a shirt but did not have shoes, Park said. Cendoya's arms and legs were covered in scratches, officials said. He was rushed to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where he arrived in \\"very serious\\" condition, Dr. Michael Ritter said. Ritter said Thursday that Cendoya was responding well to treatment and would probably be released in a few days. Cendoya's rescue reinvigorated crews searching for Jack, authorities said Thursday morning. Ritter said Cendoya told him the pair had been \\"hiking around\\" Sunday when night fell and they somehow became separated. Cendoya said that was the last time he saw Jack, the doctor said. Cendoya covered himself with brush to keep warm, Ritter said. He also prayed. \\"Nick said the thing that kept him going was praying,\\" Ritter told reporters. \\"He said he would pray every day and every night to give him the strength to get out of there.\\" [For the record, 3:40 p.m. April 4: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that UC Irvine Medical Center is in Irvine; it is in Orange.] ALSO: Groups sue to block Wal-Mart grocery from opening in Chinatown Mother accused of drowning two daughters commits suicide in jail Sex offender says being student body president helps him 'move on' ||||| A teenage girl who has been lost in a California canyon since Sunday was found today clinging to the side of a steep cliff and shouting for help, authorities said. Kyndall Jack, 18, was located a day after her male companion, Nicholas Cendoya, had been found wandering and disoriented in Cleveland National Forest. Rescue crews rappelled to rescue Jack and she was airlifted to University of California - Irvine hospital, where was being treated for severe dehydration, authorities said. \\"The most important thing is that she has been found and Nicholas has been found and they are well,\\" siad Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jason Park. Kyndall and Cendoya disappeared Easter Sunday while hiking near Trabuco Canyon, Calif.

The information came from Cendoya, who was reportedly \\"disoriented and confused\\" when found. Cendoya, 19, was located by another hiker, who was not a part of the search efforts, in thick brush shortly before sundown Wednesday, officials said. The hiker who spotted Cendoya went for help and found firefighters on an unrelated mission nearby. A helicopter brought Cendoya to Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, where he was listed in serious condition. Cendoya was located about a half-mile south of where much of the search had focused. Rescue crews worked through the night, scouring the rough terrain in hopes of finding Jack. Several dozen searchers with help from helicopters had been combing the rugged hills of Trabuco Canyon. Two volunteers got lost themselves and had to be airlifted out Wednesday. They were searching the area because the Sunday 911 call was traced to a nearby cell tower, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. John Muir said. The two were believed to have gone off trail near Holy Jim Trail, a tree-lined dirt path along a creek that leads to a waterfall and is popular with day hikers. In the 911 call, they said they were about a mile from Jack's car, which was parked at a trailhead, but rescuers expanded the search when they weren't found nearby. The area is in a section of the national forest in the Santa Ana Mountains, which lie along the border of Orange and Riverside counties southeast of Los Angeles. The trail ranges in elevation from about 2,000 feet to about 4,000 feet. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","response":"Kyndall Jack, an 18-year-old who had been missing in Orange County's Trabuco Canyon since Easter Sunday, was rescued after a hiker heard her screams and alerted rescue teams.

A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Hint: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. Answer:","response":"Building a refinery at Greendale will likely cause the acidity of the water to increase due to the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to ocean acidification."},{"question":"In 1820, Cooper's wife Susan wagered that he could write a book better than the one that she was reading. In response to the wager, Cooper wrote the novel Precaution (1820). Its focus on morals and manners was influenced by Jane Austen's approach to fiction. He anonymously published Precaution and it received favorable notice from the United States and England.

They were abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales, but continue in use for lieutenancy and shrievalty in Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland they remain in existence but have been renamed \\"cities\\" under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain \\"principal areas\\" in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system, which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire. - Wrexham County Borough is a local government principal area centred on the town of Wrexham in north-east Wales. The county borough has a population of nearly 135,000 inhabitants.

For facial redness, apply a green-tinted concealer. Apply small dots of concealer over the red areas of your face. Blend it in gently using your fingertips or a makeup sponge. If the redness persists over time or is too strong to be covered up by concealer, you may have a condition called rosacea. Contact your dermatologist if you think you may have it. Avoid applying a heavy layer. The concealer may or may not cover up all of the redness on your face. Even if a standard, moderate amount does not hide every ounce of unwanted red, you should avoid using a thick coating of it. The green tint might start showing through if there is too much concealer to blend into your skin. If you're trying to cover widespread redness from a sunburn, a green-tinted primer might be better than concealer. Your skin redness may be due to sun exposure. Apply sunscreen before leaving the house, even when it seems cloudy. Facial and sensitive-skin sunscreens exist at your local drugstore. Sunscreen must be at least SPF 30 to be effective. “Non comedogenic” sunscreen avoids clogging up your pores. You can also buy face makeup or moisturizer that has sunscreen in it. In drier, colder weather, your face can get wind burnt and the particles in the air can strip away healthy layers of skin and damage the surface of your skin. If you protect them, your cheeks and nose will be less rosy once you step back inside a room. When your face is exposed to the cold, the blood vessels constrict, causing your skin to turn white. Once you step into a warmer area, however, all the blood rushes back to your face at once, causing your skin to become bright red. Wear a scarf, hat, or ski-mask made of non-irritating fibers. There are some dietary changes you can make to help with the redness from the inside. Hydrating, cooling foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, celery, coconuts, cucumbers, melons, peaches, papayas, spinach, and broccoli contain antioxidants capable of moisturizing your skin from the inside out. If your urine is a pale yellow that is almost clear, you are hydrated enough. If your urine is a concentrated yellow or orange-yellow, you should drink more water. By consuming more of these foods, you can protect your skin from drying out when exposed to cold winter air or other harsh, dry conditions. Avoid spicy foods, hot drinks, caffeine, and alcohol. These encourage skin redness and will only exacerbate your skin problem. Cucumbers have a high water content and many vitamins and minerals that can help hydrate your skin. Peel and slice a chilled cucumber. Lean your head back and place slices over any red areas of your face for 15 to 20 minutes. Within that amount of time, the vitamin C in the cucumber should have reduced any pesky redness. Avoid rubbing cucumber over your skin, however, since the friction can cause further irritation. Green tea has anti-inflammatory agents and helps constrict blood vessels in your skin, which will help reduce redness and inflammation. Put several tea bags or a few tablespoons of loose leaf tea in a pot of boiling water and remove from heat. Let the tea steep for 10 minutes. Once the tea steeps, pour it into a bowl and lay a washcloth in the green tea, soaking it up as the tea cools. When the tea is at room temperature, run the tea soaked cloth over your face. You can also use chamomile and peppermint tea. Avoid using peppermint tea if your skin is sensitive. Make sure you use a cloth you don't mind getting stained. The green tea will have a color and will likely stain whatever cloth you use. Do not rub the cloth over your face vigorously, since that will irritate your skin further. Be careful putting petroleum jelly on acne-prone skin: it can make acne worse. For an extra layer of protection on your skin, you can spread a thin coating of petroleum jelly over your face. The petroleum jelly will prevent your blood vessels from constricting and expanding too quickly, which can reduce or prevent most facial redness. If you are unsure, apply to a small area of your cheek where your redness is not the worst. If your skin is redder or more irritated in a few hours, do not apply jelly to the rest of your face. Cold temperatures can reduce redness by shrinking the blood vessels in your skin. This method is especially useful if the redness is accompanied by feelings of burning or swelling. For the cold compress, take a clean, soft washcloth and run it under cool water. Gently press it to the irritated area. You can also use an icepack wrapped heavily in towels, if you want to avoid a wet compress. You can also place a wet washcloth in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool it before pressing it to your face. Do not use rough or cold washcloths.","response":"Normal concealers may not effectively hide facial redness, but corrective concealers use complementary colors to balance out discolored skin.

Now, let's think step by step:","response":"Step 1: Define shooting sports Shooting sports are competitive and recreational activities involving the use of various types of firearms or airguns, where participants aim to shoot at specific targets with the goal of achieving the highest possible accuracy. Step 2: Identify types of shooting sports There are various types of shooting sports, including rifle, pistol, shotgun, long-range, and airgun events. These sports may be held on indoor or outdoor ranges and involve various types of targets, such as paper targets, steel plates, or flying clay targets. Step 3: Understand the use of bullets in these shooting sports For most shooting sports involving firearms, bullets are used as projectiles. Bullets are the metal (usually lead) components of a cartridge that are fired from a gun and impact the target. In some shooting sports involving airguns, pellets or BBs are used as projectiles instead. Step 4: Assess shooting sports that do not involve bullets In the case of airgun shooting sports, pellets or BBs are used as projectiles rather than traditional bullets. Archery can also be considered a shooting sport, though it involves arrows rather than bullets. Step 5: Conclude While the majority of shooting sports do involve the use of bullets, not all of them do. Airgun sports, for instance, utilize pellets or BBs as projectiles, and other shooting disciplines such as archery do not involve bullets at all."},{"question":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Question: What land mass are the killer whales nearest? Answer: Pick your answer from: [I] not enough information; [II] San Juan Islands; [III] Fishing village of Steveston; [IV] Vancouver;","response":"The killer whales are nearest to the land mass of the San Juan Islands. According to the context, they are the most studied whales in the world and have observed humans for at least six thousand years.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Ingham County Michigan had a population of 9,126 as of the 2010 census","response":"The conclusion drawn, stating that \\"Ingham County Michigan had a population of 9,126 as of the 2010 census\\" is incorrect based on the information provided. The given data pertains only to the Charter Township of Lansing, which is a charter township within Ingham County. According to the 2010 census, the Charter Township of Lansing had a population of 8,126. However, Ingham County encompasses a broader area including several other municipalities and townships besides the Charter Township of Lansing. As the census data mentioned only accounts for the population of the Charter Township of Lansing, it would be inaccurate to conclude that the entire population of Ingham County is 9,126. To determine the population of Ingham County as of the 2010 census, we would need to refer to official census records. According to the United States Census Bureau, Ingham County had a population of 280,895 at the time of the 2010 census. This population includes residents of Lansing, East Lansing, Mason (the county seat), and several other smaller communities within the county, all contributing to the overall population count.

I will outline the issues we faced during our visit and why I would advise prospective visitors to reconsider their options before paying a visit to [Place]. Firstly, I would like to point out the lack of cleanliness at [Place]. Upon arrival, we noticed that the premises were not well-maintained, with visible dirt and trash scattered around in various corners. The restrooms were unsanitary, with no soap or tissue paper available, forcing us either to use the limited hand sanitizer we brought along or to find alternative facilities outside. Secondly, the customer service we received was subpar at best. The staff members were uninterested in providing assistance, and though I can understand that they may have had a long day, their lack of enthusiasm and professionalism significantly affected our experience. To make matters worse, when we did engage with the staff to address specific issues, they were not only unhelpful but also occasionally rude. Moreover, the overall ambiance of [Place] was far from inviting. The lighting was too dim in some areas, making it difficult to navigate safely, while in other areas, we found the music to be overly loud and obnoxious. Ultimately, this resulted in the majority of our group feeling uncomfortable and reluctant to spend additional time at the venue. Furthermore, we were disappointed with the food and drink options available at [Place]. The menu was limited, and the prices were surprisingly high for the quality we received. The few items we did try were bland and forgettable. Others in our group experienced stomach discomfort shortly after consuming their meals, which further marred the experience. Finally, I would like to address the value for money aspect of our visit. Considering the various issues we faced during our time at [Place], it became evident that the entrance fees and the amount we spent on food and drinks were definitely not worth the subpar experience we ended up having. There are countless other venues in the area offering superior service, ambiance, and food at more reasonable prices. In summary, our visit to [Place] was a disappointing and unsatisfactory experience. The lack of cleanliness, inadequate customer service, unpleasant ambiance, mediocre food options, and poor value for money left a lasting negative impression on our group. I would not recommend this place to friends or family, and I urge anyone considering a visit to [Place] to explore other options that will likely result in a more enjoyable experience."},{"question":"The Weavers (German: Die Weber) is a 1927 German silent historical drama film directed by Frederic Zelnik and starring Paul Wegener, Valeska Stock and Hermann Picha.

The Answers Say a Lot About Tech Y Combinator, which helped incubate Airbnb Inc. and Instacart Inc., has a reputation for having an application process that’s more exclusive than Harvard University’s. About 6,000 aspiring startups applied to the Silicon Valley business incubator’s summer 2016 class in hopes of being one of the 107 or so to receive a 120,000 investment and access to the group’s well-connected investors and executives. Beneath the techie buzzwords and fanciful projections, the applications provide a unique view into the rapidly changing technology scene from the perspective of up-and-comers. Online marketing and data firm Priceonomics recently analyzed eight years of Y Combinator submissions. The results give a snapshot of industry trends and entrepreneurs’ views of who’s hot and who’s not in tech. Y Combinator asks applicants to list their competitors. Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. dominate the responses, but Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb are gaining quickly. Their names were mentioned more than half as many times as Google’s in 2016, according to the Priceonomics analysis. Uber, a ride-hailing company that’s established itself as a Valley golden child with a valuation of 62.5 billion, was mentioned in 2.6 percent of applications this year. Slack Technologies Inc., a messaging app for businesses, has seen a significant uptick in mentions. Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack. Willett Advisors, the investment arm for the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP, invests in Y Combinator startups. Facebook’s Instagram is a perennial threat on startups’ radar. But WhatsApp, which Facebook spent far more to acquire in a 22 billion deal, has plateaued in the eyes of Y Combinator hopefuls. Snapchat Inc., another messaging app Facebook has targeted, was on a similar trajectory in the last year. For Dropbox Inc., the hype cycle has been winding down for the last few years. After leading a list of five highly valued private companies in 2012, Dropbox’s presence in Y Combinator submissions has been on a steady decline since 2013, according to the Priceonomics study. Dropbox’s drop coincides with concerns expressed by the company’s own investors, several of which have repeatedly written down the value of their stakes. However, Dropbox, which makes money by charging users for more cloud storage space, is well-positioned for another trend: the rise of subscription-based software businesses. Y Combinator applicants have increased references to so-called software-as-a-service revenue models by 400 percent since 2008. Meanwhile, advertising is falling out of vogue. The shift highlights a rush toward sustainable, more predictable businesses as venture capitalists begin to prioritize revenue over user growth. Startups are staying private longer -- no tech company went public last quarter -- leaving VCs concerned they’ll have to invest more over longer periods of time to keep startups afloat. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article highlights the analysis of startup application trends to Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, which has backed successful companies like Airbnb and Instacart. The analysis, conducted by online marketing and data firm Priceonomics, sheds light on the rapidly changing technology landscape and entrepreneurs' perspectives on trends and competition. A key finding from the analysis is the increasing mention of Uber and Airbnb as competitors in applicants' submissions, with both companies' names appearing more than half as many times as Google's in 2016. This suggests the growing influence of these companies in the technology sector and the emergence of competition in the sharing economy. Another notable trend is the rising popularity of subscription-based software businesses, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue models. Mentions of such models in Y Combinator applications have increased by 400% since 2008, reflecting a shift towards more sustainable and predictable revenue streams. This change aligns with venture capitalists' increasing prioritization of revenue over user growth, as startups remain private for longer periods, requiring more investment over extended timeframes. Additionally, the article points out the fluctuating fortunes of different tech companies in the eyes of entrepreneurs. While Facebook's Instagram continues to be perceived as a significant threat, WhatsApp's relevance, owned by Facebook, has plateaued. Meanwhile, Dropbox suffers from waning attention, with its mentions in Y Combinator submissions consistently declining since 2013. This decline corresponds with concerns expressed by the company's own investors, who have periodically written down the value of their stakes. In summary, the analysis of Y Combinator applications offers valuable insights into the shifting trends and competitive landscape of the technology sector, revealing the growing impact of companies like Uber and Airbnb, as well as the increasing adoption of subscription-based software business models."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: boat, sea, tractor, trailer","response":"Step 1: Identify the related words. - Boat and sea are related, as boats are used on the sea. - Tractor and trailer are related, as tractors can pull trailers.

Pick your answer from: [I] The wire will become warmer.; [II] The wire will lose some of its mass.; [III] The wire will form an electric field.; [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure.; Answer:","response":"Answer: [I] The wire will become warmer. Explanation: When an electrical circuit is working properly, an electric current flows through the wire, which consists of moving charged particles such as electrons. As these electrons flow through the wire, they occasionally interact with the wire's atoms, which vibrate and create resistance. The resistance provided by the wire's atoms results in a transfer of energy from the electrons to the atoms, as the electrons lose some of their energy during the collisions. This energy transfer manifests itself as heat, which causes the wire's temperature to increase. Therefore, the wire will become warmer when an electrical circuit is functioning properly. This effect is most noticeable in cases where the resistance of the wire is relatively high, such as in incandescent light bulbs, where the wire becomes hot enough to produce light when an electric current passes through it. Regarding the other options: [II] The wire will lose some of its mass: It is highly unlikely that the wire will lose any significant portion of its mass while an electrical circuit is working properly. While some loss may occur due to electron collisions causing atoms to be displaced from the wire's surface, the amount of mass lost in this way would be negligible and not noticeable. [III] The wire will form an electric field: While a magnetic field is created around the wire when current flows through it, the electric field is a property of charged objects, not necessarily the wire itself. As an electrical circuit works properly, the electric field would not be a result of the wire itself but rather the voltage source and connected components that influence the distribution of charges. [IV] The wire will develop a new crystal structure: There is no substantial basis for the claim that a new crystal structure will form in the wire. Under normal operating conditions, the wire's lattice structure remains relatively unchanged. However, it should be noted that in cases where high amounts of heat are generated, like in the case of highly resistive wires used in heating elements, the structure may be subject to change over extended usage and time. These changes are usually due to mechanical stress or high-temperature effects, but they are not expected under typical conditions."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet. Pick from: [i] negative. [ii] positive.","response":"The sentiment of this tweet can be interpreted as negative. Here's a detailed analysis as to why: [i] Negative: 1. Boredom generally indicates dissatisfaction with one's current situation or activity, which is often considered as a negative emotion. The use of the word \\"bored\\" in the tweet highlights the person's unpleasant state of mind. 2. The repetition of the word \\"really\\" three times intensifies the degree to which the user is feeling bored. This amplifies the negative sentiment, suggesting a stronger expression of this unpleasant emotion. 3. The absence of any positive language or context within the tweet makes it difficult to perceive positivity in the sentiment. The focus remains entirely on the experience of boredom, highlighting the negative emotion associated with it. 4. The use of multiple periods, also known as an ellipsis, at the end of the tweet, could suggest a sense of resignation, a trailing off, or a feeling of being lost. This punctuation choice supports the presence of a negative sentiment, as it might be implying a hopeless or stuck-in-a-rut kind of feeling. Taking these points into consideration, the sentiment of this tweet can be identified as negative. The tweet centers around a negative emotion, boredom, and amplifies it through the repetition of reinforcing adverbs and punctuation choices, ultimately leading to a negative interpretation of the sentiment."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Vanadzor, is the third-largest city in Armenia and the capital of the Lori Province in the northern part of the country.

Plot title: In the Cut Movie plot: High school teacher and writer Frannie Avery meets a student at a local bar, and when she heads to the bathroom sees a woman performing oral sex on a man. A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city. She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's dismembered body. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out.

Since we know that \\"clams live at the bottom of the ocean\\", the best option from the given choices would be \\"4. in sea depths\\". However, it is important to provide a more detailed and lengthy explanation for this choice, taking into account the different factors that play a role in clam collection and ocean depths. Firstly, it is essential to consider the various types of clams that are edible and ideal for supper. Some common varieties include hard-shell clams (also known as quahogs), soft-shell clams (or steamers), and razor clams. Each type of clam has its habitat and specific method of collection. They are generally found along the coastal areas, where ocean tides play a significant role in their life cycle. To collect clams, it is not necessary to dive into deep sea depths. Rather, one should find a suitable location along the coastline, ideally in areas with tidal flats, sandy or muddy bottoms, and shallow water, since these are the preferred habitats of clams. Before heading out to collect clams, it is crucial to know and follow local regulations, seasons, and limits. This can include the requirement of a permit, a specific legal clam size, and a daily bag limit. Responsible clam harvesting not only ensures sustainability but also helps maintain a healthy ecosystem. The collection of clams can be done during low tide when the water recedes, allowing easier access to the ocean floor where clams are buried. Some common clamming methods include digging in the soft sediment with a shovel or rake, using a clamming gun (a suction device specifically designed for clam collection), or simply using bare hands to feel for buried clams. While the actual method utilized may depend on the type of clam being collected and local customs, the common denominator is spending time along the shoreline where clams dwell. Therefore, the boy in question must spend time \\"in sea depths\\", but with a clearer understanding that he should be focused more on coastal areas with appropriate conditions for clam collection, rather than diving deep into the ocean. In conclusion, based on the initial information about clams, the boy would have the most success collecting clams for supper by spending time along the shoreline in appropriate areas, focusing on the sea depths, and particularly during low tide, to locate and harvest these delectable shellfish."},{"question":"USS \\"Elrod\\" (FFG-55), an \\"Oliver Hazard Perry\\"-class frigate, is a ship of the United States Navy named after Captain Henry T.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","response":"You can absolutely create your own BBQ seasoning, and it’s a great way to achieve the perfect blend of flavors tailored to your preferences. Here is a detailed guide to help you create your own seasoning mix: 1. Understand the flavor profile: A good BBQ seasoning generally consists of a balance between four key flavors: sweet, salty, tangy, and spicy. Understanding this balance will help you choose the right ingredients for your seasoning mix. 2. Select the base ingredients: The foundation of any BBQ seasoning is a combination of paprika, salt, and black pepper. Paprika lends a smoky flavor and vibrant color, while salt enhances the other spices and brings out the natural flavors of your food. Black pepper adds some heat and complexity to the mix. 3. Customize your seasoning: This is where you can get creative and really personalize your BBQ seasoning. Choose additional ingredients based on your own taste preferences and the type of dish you'll be using the seasoning on. Some popular options are: - Sweeteners: Brown sugar or maple sugar can add a touch of sweetness to your seasoning mix. - Spices: Garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin can create a depth of flavor. - Tangy elements: Ground mustard or dried lemon/orange zest can add a tangy, acidic touch. - Heat components: Crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, or chipotle powder can introduce various levels of heat to your mix. 4. Measure the ingredients: While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all recipe for BBQ seasoning, using the following approximate measurements can guide you in creating a balanced mix: - 2 parts paprika - 1 part salt - 1 part black pepper - 1/2 to 1 part additional sweet, tangy, or spicy elements (depending on your preference) 5. Mix the ingredients: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl or jar. Mix well to ensure that everything is evenly distributed and no clumps are left behind. 6. Taste and adjust: Taste your seasoning mix and see if it needs any adjustments. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or heat to suit your preferences. 7. Store in an airtight container: Transfer your seasoning mix to an airtight container, such as a jar or plastic bag, and store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. 8. Use your BBQ seasoning: You can use your seasoning mix on various meats, seafood, and even vegetables. Apply the seasoning generously and cook your food as desired, either by grilling, roasting, or pan-searing. In terms of naive physics reasoning, the first solution of creating your own seasoning mix is more sound because it provides a practical and achievable way to control the flavor balance. The second solution is not provided in the question, but any method that would rely heavily on pre-made or store-bought products may not offer the same level of customization or understanding of flavor combinations as creating your own mix does."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

How do you say this sentence in English?","response":"The sentence \\"¿Para qué sirve el CO2?\\" in English translates to \\"What is the purpose of CO2?\\" or \\"What is CO2 used for?\\" Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound consisting of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, and it serves several essential functions in our environment and various industries. 1. Photosynthesis: CO2 plays a vital role in the process of photosynthesis carried out by plants, algae, and some microorganisms. These organisms use sunlight, water, and CO2 to produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy for growth, and release oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis maintains a balance of oxygen and CO2 in the atmosphere and is the primary source of oxygen required for life on Earth. 2. The Carbon Cycle: CO2 is a crucial component of the Earth's natural carbon cycle, where carbon is exchanged among the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems. It is released into the atmosphere through respiration, decomposition of organic matter, and combustion of fossil fuels. CO2 in the atmosphere can be absorbed by plants for photosynthesis or dissolved in the ocean, where it participates in the marine ecosystem and can eventually form carbonate rocks. This continuous cycle helps regulate Earth's climate and atmospheric composition. 3. Greenhouse Effect: CO2 is a greenhouse gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation. The greenhouse effect refers to the process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, warming the Earth's surface and stabilizing its climate. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have led to an increase in CO2 concentrations, causing a significant impact on global climate change. 4. Industrial and Commercial Uses: CO2 has various applications in different industries and commercial processes. It is used in food and beverage industries as a refrigerant, to carbonate drinks, and to preserve freshness. In the medical field, CO2 is utilized for its constriction and dilation properties in certain medical procedures. Additionally, CO2 is employed in fire extinguishers, the production of chemicals, and enhanced oil recovery techniques. In conclusion, carbon dioxide plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of life on Earth and has a range of applications across various industries. However, it is essential to manage CO2 emissions responsibly to prevent adverse effects on the environment and global climate."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"what is the first area mentioned?\\" Context: \\"Ptolemy's Geography divided Asia on a similar basis.

The dance troupe originated in Paris, France, and quickly gained widespread acclaim for their high-kicking and spectacular choreographed routines, forever changing the face of French cabaret entertainment. Margaret Kelly was born on June 24, 1910, in Liverpool, England. She began dancing at a young age and pursued a career as a professional dancer. After moving to Paris, she was given the nickname \\"Miss Bluebell\\" due to her beautiful blue eyes. This, in turn, inspired the name of her famed dance troupe. The Bluebell Girls were initially formed as a chorus line of classically trained dancers with precise choreography, adept at performing high leg-kicks and elaborate dance routines. The group's home base was the legendary Lido de Paris, a luxurious cabaret and burlesque show venue located on the world-famous Champs-Élysées. They quickly became the star attraction at the Lido and across numerous other premier Parisian entertainment venues such as the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère. The key to the Bluebell Girls' immense success was largely due to Margaret Kelly's high standards and commitment to discipline and quality. She carefully chose talented dancers from around the world, ensuring they were well-trained and exhibited grace, poise, elegance, and uniformity. The girls stood out due to their height, which was a crucial factor in their selection. Margaret Kelly insisted that her dancers should be tall, with a minimum height requirement of 5'8\\" for American dancers and 5'10\\" for dancers of other nationalities. Throughout their illustrious career, the Bluebell Girls performed for millions of people, including Hollywood stars, politicians, and European royalty. They participated in renowned events such as the prestigious Royal Variety Performance in England, and their shows were elaborate productions complete with ornate costumes, grand sets, and spectacular special effects. Margaret Kelly's Bluebell Girls served as a stepping stone for many dancers who would eventually develop successful solo careers in the entertainment industry. Kelly eventually retired from active involvement in the dance troupe in 1986, though she remained the honorary president until her death in 2004. Today, the legacy of the Bluebell Girls and their contribution to the world of cabaret and dance endures, as they continue to uphold the high standards set by their founder. In summary, Margaret Kelly founded the iconic Bluebell Girls dance troupe in 1932 in Paris, France. Trained in classical dance, the group revolutionized French cabaret entertainment with their high-kicking routines and unique blend of elegance, precision, and glamour. The legacy of the Bluebell Girls lives on as they continue to captivate audiences across the world as a symbol of timeless showmanship and the creative vision of their pioneering founder."},{"question":"Give the rationale and then the answer. \\"Commas should be used to mark the end of a sentence.\\" Is the above claim true?

Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries? Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.","response":"Based on the information provided, Robert is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries. This is because he only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, whereas Michael took the advice to heart and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Regular aerobic exercise is known to lower LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol), which helps to prevent the build-up of LDL cholesterol in the arteries. Since Robert exercises less frequently than Michael, he has a higher risk of LDL cholesterol build-up."},{"question":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Two-million-year-old South African had different diet to other pre-humans. 'Missing link' fossil analysed to judge diet. Short, gangly creature ate leaves and fruit like chimps. Article:","response":"Title: The Unique Diet of Two-Million-Year-Old South African Pre-Humans Introduction Recent analysis of a two-million-year-old \\"missing link\\" fossil discovered in South Africa has provided fascinating insights into the diet of these pre-humans. While the diet of other early hominids has been relatively well-documented, little was known about the unique South African species, until now. Researchers have found that unlike other pre-human species, this short and gangly creature consumed a diet rich in leaves and fruit – a striking resemblance to the diet of modern-day chimpanzees. Unearthing the Missing Link The fossil in question, referred to as the \\"missing link,\\" is believed to bridge the evolutionary gap between modern humans and their distant ancestors. Uncovered in South Africa, this rare find has the potential to shed light on the little-known history of our own lineage. By studying the diet of these early hominids, scientists hope to better understand the evolutionary changes that led to the development of Homo sapiens as the sole surviving member of the hominid taxonomic family. A Diet Rich in Leaves and Fruit Researchers have meticulously analyzed the fossil's preserved dental remains, offering a glimpse of a species that once thrived in the abundant landscapes of South Africa. Intriguingly, the findings revealed that this particular hominid had a diet predominantly composed of leaves and fruit. Such a diet starkly contrasts with that of other pre-humans, making this South African species truly unique. The research team's findings showed strong evidence of the short and gangly creature relying heavily on soft, easy-to-consume vegetation like leaves, while also incorporating larger quantities of fruit into its dietary intake. These food choices significantly differ from other pre-human diets that were primarily based on nuts, seeds, and root vegetables – a reflection of a distinct lifestyle and habitat. A Connection to Modern Chimpanzees Interestingly, the diet of the South African pre-human species draws an intriguing parallel with that of present-day chimpanzees. Chimps are known to primarily consume fruit and leaves, with a diet comprising of approximately 58% fruit, 27% leaves, and the remaining percentage consisting of seeds, flowers, and other plant materials, as well as insects. This striking similarity in dietary habits between the two-million-year-old South African pre-human and modern chimpanzees provides intriguing insights into their potential relationship and shared ancestry. Conclusion The analysis of this rare \\"missing link\\" fossil has undeniably expanded our understanding of early human evolution, particularly concerning the unique dietary habits of the South African pre-human species. By comparing this pre-human's diet to that of modern chimpanzees, scientists can uncover new information about the evolution of our own species and the environment in which it thrived. The findings prompt further exploration into the diets and lifestyles of pre-human species found in other regions, creating a more comprehensive view of the diverse history of humankind. As the field of paleoanthropology continues to evolve and unearth new discoveries, we come one step closer to unraveling the fascinating mysteries that lie at the core of our own lineage and history."},{"question":"Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.

The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers.

The warm, inviting ambiance and friendly staff made for a great first impression. The menu boasted an impressive range of dishes, and I couldn't wait to try them out. I opted for the Grilled Salmon with Mango Salsa, which proved to be an excellent choice. The salmon was cooked to perfection – tender and flaky, with a crisp exterior. The mango salsa was a delightful contrast of flavors, adding a refreshing note to the dish. For dessert, I indulged in their signature Chocolate Lava Cake, sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. The cake was moist and rich, with a warm, gooey center that oozed out when I cut into it – sheer decadence! The service at Delicious Delights was impeccable. Our waitress was attentive and accommodating, ensuring that our dining experience was flawless. She offered great recommendations and promptly addressed any requests we had. In terms of value for money, Delicious Delights did not disappoint. The quality and quantity of food, coupled with the attentive service and cozy atmosphere, made the meal well worth its price. Overall, I highly recommend Delicious Delights for those looking for an exceptional dining experience. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just craving a satisfying meal, this restaurant is a must-visit culinary gem!

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Chan's mother believes that: - Chan should speak up more - not enough information - Chan was too small for his age - Chan's birth was a curse on her garden Answer:","response":"Based on the story provided, Chan's mother mainly believes two things about Chan. Firstly, she believes that Chan's birth was a curse on her garden. The text mentions that her once fruitful garden could now grow nothing more than the most meager of weeds, a change that began with Chan's birth. It appears that she attributes the decline of her garden to Chan's birth since it occurred during the wrong phase of the moon and in the wrong month, which she associates with bad luck. Secondly, she finds Chan's size unusual, as the text specifies that Chan was small for his age. It's unclear whether she genuinely worries about his health or if she sees this as yet another indicator of bad luck since the story doesn't go into detail on this matter. There is not enough information in the text to definitively say that Chan's mother believes that Chan should speak up more. Though Chan is noted as being quiet and more of a listener, no perspective or opinion of the mother towards this behavior of Chan's is mentioned. So, the belief that Chan should speak up more cannot be definitively inferred from the provided text. The story is more focused on how Chan's mother views him as a harbinger of bad luck and how that perspective affects her behaviour towards him, despite glimpses of kindness occasionally. Chan, on the other hand, remains hopeful and patient, believing that his parents will eventually come to love him."},{"question":"Q:Question: \\"Where could you have had a pot to cook but no food?\\" Context: \\"Not all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order: the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery.

Early Japanese societies and other East Asian cultures used pottery before developing agriculture.\\" Answer: A:","response":"In the context provided, early farming societies in the Near East could have had a pot to cook but no food. This is because they did not use pottery, which would have been essential for cooking purposes, even though they were engaged in agricultural practices. These societies focused on agriculture and domestication but had not yet incorporated pottery into their daily lives. On the other hand, early Japanese societies and other East Asian cultures used pottery before developing agriculture. In such societies, they would have access to pots for cooking but might have limited food resources as they had not yet fully embraced farming practices. These cultures gradually adopted agriculture alongside their existing pottery skills, leading to a more balanced approach to both food production and preparation. In short, the early farming societies in the Near East could have had a situation where they had a pot to cook (or the ability to create one) but limited food options, as they had not yet adopted the use of pottery.

(Photo: KHOU 11 News) KATY, Texas - Katy ISD's superintendent and the school principal addressed the media for the first time Wednesday afternoon after a seventh grader claimed a teacher forced her to deny God's existence as part of a graded class assignment. Superintendent Alton Frailey praised the student, Jordan Wooley for speaking up when she felt she was being forced to choose between a class assignment and her faith. While Frailey said interviews with several students and the class teacher aren't backing up Wooley's story, some other parents are. \\"Highly inappropriate, has not been used again, will not be used,\\" said Frailey. \\"In fact, it's literally in the trash can.\\" That was Frailey's reaction to the class assignment that's grabbed national headlines and even garnered support from Gov. Greg Abbott on Twitter. \\"(Were) the students told they had to deny God?\\" said Frailey. \\"No one corroborated that.\\" The firestorm started after Wooley, a student at West Memorial Jr. High, told the Katy ISD School Board Monday night she received a graded class assignment earlier in the day that made her answer whether the statement \\"There is a God\\" was a fact, opinion, or common assertion. \\"I said it was fact or opinion,\\" said Wooley. But Wooley said her reading teacher told her both her answers were wrong and that she had to admit God wasn't real. \\"I didn't really know what to do,\\" said Wooley, who told her mother, Chantel Wooley immediately after school. Chantel Wooley told KHOU 11 News shortly before Wednesday's press conference that even after the school's principal called her on Tuesday afternoon, she didn't believe the district was taking responsibility. \\"They're just making it sound like an assignment that shouldn't have gone out, but they're not really talking about how the teacher berated and bullied the children in class,\\" said Chantel Wooley. \\"The Principal talked with at least eight students in class of 22, those assertions were not corroborated by the other students,\\" said Frailey. However, two parents joined Chantel Wooley on an online radio station Wednesday afternoon and disputed the district's claim that the assignment was ungraded. \\"What she said the teacher told them in her class period is also what she told them in my son's class period,\\" said a woman named Deanna, who told Resurrect the Republic Truth Radio that her son received the same assignment. \\"They were always under the assumption that this was for a grade and they were told if they put anything besides myth on that question that it would be wrong.\\" The district also disputed claims by the parents that the same assignment was used in a different class the next day. As for the teacher, Frailey would only say that she's at home Wednesday on her own choosing and that the situation has been \\"addressed appropriately by the principal.\\" Frailey added the assignment was designed by another teacher and handed down. However, Chantel Wooley says she's still trying to move her daughter out of that teacher's class Read or Share this story: http://on.khou.com/1MjOIv7 ||||| Katy ISD Superintendent Alton Frailey and others addressed the media Wednesday afternoon for the first time regarding the claims of a local junior high student who says her teacher forced students to deny God. The firestorm began when West Memorial Junior High 7th-grader Jordan Wooley went before the school board Monday night and said that she believes lesson content involved in her reading class on Monday was inappropriate and overstepped its bounds. She said students were told to identify several statements as fact, opinion or a common assertion in the assignment, and one read ‘There is a God.’ “We were asked to take a poll to say whether God is a fact, opinion or myth, and she (the teacher) said anyone who said it was fact or opinion was wrong and that God is only a myth,” Wooley told the board. Katy ISD said the assignment was meant to test critical thinking skills and not slight anyone’s religious beliefs, but has acknowledged that the statement was inappropriate and “unnecessary in achieving the instructional standard.” According to Wooley, she named the existence of God as both a fact and opinion, but her teacher insisted it was simply a common assertion or myth. When other students argued, it allegedly resulted in a classroom argument which ended with a student slamming everything off their desk in aggravation. Wooley told the school board she countered and attempted to prove her point by citing the Bible and accounts of people who went to heaven and returned to tell their stories, but her teacher allegedly stated that those were not facts and that those people were simply trying to get attention. “She started telling kids that they were completely wrong and when kids would argue, she had told them they would get in trouble,” she said. “I felt like this was really wrong,” she added. “I didn’t feel like it was fair for my faith or my religion to have anything to do with what I am learning about in school.” Wooley also alleged that one of her friends also answered the question as being a fact, but says the teacher crossed it out several times when the student turned it in saying the answer was wrong. However, despite several parents supporting Wooley’s assertions, district officials said at Wednesday’s press conference that Wooley’s statements were not backed up by other students accounts. “The principal talked with at least eight other students in the class of 22 and the teacher as well. In the investigation those assertions were not corroborated by other students. Was the activity graded? No. Was it 40 percent of their grade? Absolutely not. Were the students told they had to deny God? Nobody corroborated that,” Frailey said “She believes what she believes, but other students did not share the same beliefs,” he added. KISD also disputed the claim that the “highly inappropriate” activity was used even the day after the alleged incident. The district says it is no longer in use by the teacher or campus, and appropriate personnel action has been taken. The teacher in question, who the district previously said is “distraught by this incident,” is currently at home by her own volition. Frailey praised Wooley’s courage to take a stand when she truly felt her faith was being challenged. “I applaud Jordan’s courage, and as a parent of three I understand the desire to keep our children safe and not have their beliefs questioned,” Frailey said. “If I had any reason to believe in any evidence to support it, that the teacher did do what has been alleged, I will stand with Jordan as well.” According to the district, the assignment was borrowed from another teacher. Frailey says it is unclear at this time which instructor created the activity. Video of Jordan’s testimony and the district’s press conference can be found at katyisd.org. ||||| Katy student contends school activity called faith into question School superintendent praises student's courage, disputes claim The seventh grader's head barely reached above the podium Monday night as she told Katy ISD board members about a classroom exercise that she felt wrongly called her religious faith into doubt. Two days later, during a Wednesday afternoon news conference held in the same meeting room, Superintendent Alton Frailey praised the student's courage but said a school investigation could not corroborate aspects of her description. By that time, news of Jordan Wooley's four-minute, video-recorded testimony from the meeting had spread like wildfire across Facebook and other social media platforms. \\"Today I was given an assignment in school that questioned my faith and told me that God was not real,\\" she begins in the remarks. On Monday afternoon, in a classroom at West Memorial Junior High School, a teacher had presented Jordan and her classmates with a task: to decide whether certain statements were fact, opinion or commonplace assertions, a category Wooley described as \\"myth.\\" \\"The fastest land dwelling creature is the Cheetah,\\" read the first prompt on the worksheet used for the exercise, according to a screenshot provided by the district. \\"There is a God,\\" read the second. As a Christian, Jordan found the second statement to be fact. But the teacher, also a Christian, said those who thought God's existence was fact or opinion were wrong, as Jordan recounted it. \\"When I tried to argue, she told me to prove it,\\" Jordan said, explaining that her attempt to cite the Bible was discounted. Jordan described the effects of the exercise on her classmates. A friend who went home and began to cry. Another friend who was so aggravated she \\"wound up slamming everything off of her desk,\\" Jordan said. A third of her peers, who asked the teacher if the students could include what they believe on the assignment, and was told, \\"You can if you want to get the problem wrong... You'll fail the paper if you do,\\" Jordan said. The school's investigation, however, found that students were neither forced to deny God nor threatened with a lower or a failing grade if they did not, Frailey said Wednesday. He maintained that the assignment was neither graded nor used by any other teachers. The investigation included interviews with 11 students, including Jordan, according to a news release late Wednesday. Another finding listed in the news release said \\"the activity did not result in any arguments in the classroom.\\" Frailey declined to discuss any action that may have been taken against the teacher, but said she was at home of her own volition. This is the teacher's first year in the school district, he said. Frailey said he would continue to place confidence in the district's teachers regarding the materials used in their classrooms but said the statement regarding God's reality should not have been included on the worksheet. \\"No student in Katy ISD will have their faith denounced,\\" he said. The classroom exercise was \\"designed to encourage critical thinking skills and dialogue,\\" according to a statement from the district, not to \\"question or challenge any student's religious beliefs.\\" \\"The teacher is distraught by this incident, as some commentary has gone as far as to vilify her without knowing her, her Christian faith, or the context of the classroom activity,\\" continued the statement, which did not identify the instructor. \\"Still, this does not excuse the fact that this ungraded activity was ill-conceived and because of that, its intent had been misconstrued.\\" Jordan had reported the incident to her mother, who contacted the school and on the same day brought her daughter to testify to the board. \\"I didn't feel like it was fair for my faith and my religion to have anything to do with what I'm learning about in school,\\" Jordan told the school board. News reports emerged nationwide, and tweets abounded, including one from Gov. Greg Abbott's personal Twitter handle: \\"I'm proud of this 7th grader's unyielding commitment to God. She's Texas tough.\\" Frailey lamented the firestorm. \\"It's unfortunate because there's been a lot of piling on since the time this happened,\\" he said. \\"And you have a teacher under that pile ... a seventh-grade student under that pile, and a parent, a principal and school.\\" Dylan Baddour contributed to this report ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"A seventh-grade student at West Memorial Junior High School in Katy, Texas, claimed that a teacher forced her to deny the existence of God as part of a graded class assignment.

Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones.

A dog show in which Philo has entered his Scottish terrier Captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects. The mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting. Since the talkies are still quite young, the camera work is a little static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action. The supporting cast is excellent; the entire cast brings the film up a notch. Lots of actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was made before \\"The Thin Man\\" catapulted him to big stardom - he had spent about 12 years in film by then, beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20.

Mention of the main and supporting actors: The review highlights the excellence of the supporting cast, states that William Powell is the best fit for the role of Philo Vance among other actors, and calls Powell \\"a remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor.\\" This indicates a positive sentiment. 2. Comments about the plot and story: The review states the mystery is \\"very clever\\" and the ending/denouement is \\"both complicated and interesting.\\" It also calls \\"The Kennel Murder Case\\" a \\"great story\\" and a \\"fun film.\\" These remarks contribute to an overall positive sentiment. 3. Remarks on the direction and camera work: The review mentions that the camera work is \\"a little static\\" due to the early era of talkies but praises Michael Curtiz for doing a \\"good job directing the action.\\" This point reflects a primarily positive sentiment, despite the minor criticism on camera work. 4. Appreciation for the film's availability: The reviewer expresses gratitude for being able to access the films on DVD and TCM and urges others not to miss the film, which adds to the positive sentiment. Overall, this review can be characterized as presenting a strongly positive sentiment, as the reviewer appreciates multiple aspects of the film such as the acting, story, direction, and availability."},{"question":"Summarize this article: To clean and disinfect your water bottle, try soaking it in a mixture of white vinegar and water.

Another option is to fill the bottle with the vinegar and water solution. Then, let the solution sit in the bottle for one to two minutes. Once you have soaked the bottle, rinse out the solution. Then, use a damp brush or a sponge to scrub the bottle. Make sure you scrub the mouth and lid of the bottle well, as this is usually where germs live. Scrubbing the bottle will also help to remove any remaining vinegar in the bottle. Let the water bottle air dry on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. If you are in a rush, you can use a clean cloth to dry the bottle. Make sure you dry the mouth and lid of the bottle well.","response":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to clean and disinfect a water bottle using a simple solution of white vinegar and water. This method is efficient and effective in removing germs and bacteria, ensuring a safe and clean bottle for use. Firstly, prepare the cleaning solution by mixing equal parts of white vinegar and water in a bowl. There are two ways to use this solution for cleaning the water bottle. The first method is to submerge the bottle entirely in the solution, ensuring that it fills the inside as well. The second method is to pour the solution directly into the bottle. In either case, let the bottle soak in the solution for about one to two minutes for the cleaning process to take effect. After soaking the bottle, thoroughly rinse out the solution using water. Proceed to scrub the entire bottle, paying extra attention to the mouth and lid areas, using a damp brush or sponge. These parts require special care as they are typically the most prone to germ accumulation. Scrubbing also helps eliminate any remaining vinegar residue inside the bottle. Once the scrubbing process is complete, allow the water bottle to air dry by placing it on a drying rack or a clean towel overnight. Air drying is more effective in removing any lingering moisture or smells. However, if you need your water bottle to dry quickly, you can use a clean cloth to pat it dry, ensuring that the mouth and lid areas are thoroughly dried as well. In summary, the article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean and germ-free water bottle for health reasons. By using a simple white vinegar and water solution, one can effectively disinfect and clean the bottle, paying particular attention to the mouth and lid areas. After scrubbing, it is crucial to let the bottle air dry or pat dry with a clean cloth to ensure a completely fresh and bacteria-free drinkware."},{"question":"According to the country's Minister of Health, the goal is that more than 90% of Ugandans will know their HIV status. The Minister, Dr Elioda Tumwesigye, spoke of the plan on 'The Truth About AIDS' on the BBC World Service. \\"We want to give an opportunity to every Ugandan at least one round to say yes or no to an HIV test,\\" he said. \\"We will go to every home, every village, and test.\\" Dr Tumwesigye claimed this door-to-door approach to testing counselling had worked well in the Western Ugandan district he represents as a member of parliament. If the East African country can establish the HIV status of nine out of every ten people, it will have achieved the first of three targets of a new grand initiative led by UNAids (the Joint United Nations programme on HIV/Aids). The 90-90-90 strategy is aimed at effectively ending the pandemic by the year 2030, by exploiting the preventative potential of well managed HIV/Aids treatment. If a patient takes their antiretroviral drugs properly, the amount of virus in the blood and other body fluids is lowered to a level where it is essentially undetectable. At these levels, the risk of transmitting the virus to other people is much reduced. The second 90 of the UNAids formula requires that 90% of those identified as HIV positive should be on antiretroviral therapy. The final criterion is that 90% of the patients on treatment must maintain complete virological suppression. In other words, therapy must be well enough administered and managed that the virus is unable to replicate in the body. UNAids has set a goal for countries to implement this regime by 2020. If nations can achieve this, computer modelling shows that the rate of new infections would be curbed drastically by the year 2030. The expense of ramping up services might be high in the short-term, but economic benefits are reaped later on as the cost of treating far fewer new patients plummets. Joshua Musinguzi, head of Uganda's Aids control programme said that his country has some way to go to reach the targets, but that they are achievable. \\"I like them because they are setting a stage for the country to move towards epidemic control. \\"The idea now is to move towards an Aids-free generation for Uganda. \\"In the last three consecutive years, we have actually enrolled more people on treatment each year than the number of new infections in those years. \\"This is a tipping point in the epidemic.\\" That is a significant milestone. However, Professor Vinand Nantulya, head of the Uganda Aids Commission, points out that currently the number of infected people on treatment is outnumbered by those who are not. \\"In Uganda, it's about 1.7 million people who should be on treatment and so far we are reaching about 800,000\\", said Prof Nantulya. \\"So we will need [more] money and [more] staff in the hospitals and clinics to put people on treatment, and then we need to follow up those on treatment to be sure that the treatment is having impact on the viral load in the blood.\\" Monitoring viral load requires expensive lab equipment that is not available in most Ugandan hospitals and clinics. More than doubling the number of people on medication will more than double the antiretroviral drugs bill. Currently about 80% of Uganda's HIV medication is paid for by international donors while the rest comes from the country's own coffers. Both overseas funders and the Ugandan government will need to dig much deeper to meet UNAids' 90-90-90 targets. According to Dr Medard Bitekyerezo, deputy chairperson of the Parliamentary Aids committee: \\"We are looking at levies on bank transactions and interest. \\"We are looking at air tickets, beer, soft drinks and even cigarettes,\\" as examples of goods and services which could be taxed to feed the AIDS fund. Dr Bitekyerezo stressed: \\"This money is going to be specifically targeted for HIV-related issues\\". Zimbabwe and Ghana are the only other African countries with similar HIV-dedicated funding mechanisms. Listen to The Truth About Aids on the BBC World Service What is a summary of this text?","response":"The Minister of Health in Uganda wants more than 90% of people in the country to know if they have HIV or not.

The goal is to help end the spread of HIV by 2030. If people with HIV take their medicine correctly, they have a much lower chance of giving the virus to others. Uganda still has some work to do to reach the 90-90-90 targets, but they believe it is possible.

When Washington wrote that, Englishmen had been referring to insects as bugs for more than a century,and Americans had already created lightning-bug .But the English were soon to stop using the bugs in their language, leaving it to the Americans to call a bug a bug in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The American bug could also be a person, referring to someone who was crazy about a particular activity. Although fan became the usual term, sports fans used to be called racing bugs, baseball bugs, and the like. Or the bug could be a small machine or object, for example, a bug-shaped car. The bug could also be a burglar alarm, from which comes the expression to bug,that is,\\"to install an alarm\\". Now it means a small piece of equipment that people use for listening secretly to others' conversations. Since the 1840s,to bug has long meant\\" to cheat\\" , and since the 1940s it has been annoying. We also know the bug as a _ in a computer program or other design.

If given the go-ahead by planners, HMP Cardiff fine-dining eaterie will be set up by the Clink Charity to help prisoners gain qualifications. Diners will be searched before being cooked for and served by the inmates. They will also have to submit an inquiry form when booking a table, which is then vetted by security, and have to bring photographic identification and hand over their mobile phones when arriving at the restaurant. The aim of the Clink Charity, which was started by professional chef Alberto Crisci, is to reduce re-offending rates of ex-offenders by training and placing graduates upon their release into the hospitality industry. It already runs a Clink restaurant in Sutton, Surrey and is looking for sites for new prison restaurants. Cardiff council's planning committee has received an application to turn the jail's former visitor centre - a detached building within the prison boundary - into a restaurant. Prisoners would work in the restaurant as cooks, waiters and cleaners, gaining City and Guilds, NVQ's and BIC's qualifications. They will serve three course meals of fresh Welsh produce grown at an organic farm at HMP Prescoed in Usk, Monmouthshire. Tables, chairs and other items of furniture used in the dining room will be manufactured by prisoners and they will also contribute poetry and art for the walls. The only real difference compared to more normal restaurants is that alcohol will be off the menu and the cutlery will be plastic.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats. I will never feel bad for the awful plight he refuses to help himself out of. I have no patience for that type of person. Know what we call them? Toxic. Poison. A waste of time. The author suffered from depression: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. After she was 16. B. While she was 16. C. Before she was 16. D. not enough information Answer:","response":"D. Not enough information The text provides information that the author suffered from severe depression, but it does not specify exactly when this began in relation to her age of 16. The depression could have commenced before, during, or after she was 16. Her depressive period is only mentioned after the discussion of her relationship with the troubled young man, but there's no clear chronological sequencing that can lead to a certain conclusion. Consequently, we cannot accurately choose between the options A. After she was 16, B. While she was 16, or C. Before she was 16. Though the fact that the author suffered from depression is acknowledged, the text doesn't provide explicit information about when this started. It's understandable that living through an abusive relationship could have been a significant contributing factor. However, the precise timeline isn't mentioned anywhere in your recollection. The mention of the author's depression is detailed as a distinct component not directly tied to her dating life or age 16 precisely. Therefore, it’s safer to state there is not enough information to specify the onset of her depression in relation to the age of 16. Furthermore, mental health issues can develop gradually and may not necessarily coincide with a specific event or age, further complicating the potential to pin down a specific timeline based on the given information."},{"question":"Q: which british prime minister declared war on germany?

Story is here to find a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber (Bob Balaban), Bell (Mary Beth Hurt), Dury (Jeffrey Wright), and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan), who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Ran meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden that Story be attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that, as Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, Guardian, Guild, and Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast Ã©migrÃ© turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer. Heep asks Story how to \\"practice\\" for the confrontation but nearly dies in the process, convincing him he's not the Guardian.

Premise: \\"A group of people surf on a very large wave.\\" Hypothesis: \\"There are people outdoors surfing on a sunny day.\\" We can break down the hypothesis into three elements: 1. There are people outdoors surfing. 2. They are surfing on a sunny day. 3. They are surfing on a very large wave. 1. There are people outdoors surfing. The premise states that \\"a group of people surf on a very large wave.\\" This information supports the first element of the hypothesis, as surfing typically takes place outdoors, and we know there is a group of people involved. So, the first element of the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 2. They are surfing on a sunny day. The premise does not mention anything about the weather or time of day during the surfing event. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis statement \\"on a sunny day\\" is entailed by the premise. 3. They are surfing on a very large wave. The premise clearly states, \\"a group of people surf on a very large wave.\\" This statement supports the third element of the hypothesis, which also mentions the very large wave. Thus, the third element of the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In conclusion, we know that the first and third elements of the hypothesis are entailed by the premise. However, the second element (\\"on a sunny day\\") is not addressed in the premise, so we cannot say that the entire hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"question":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A boy stands in the pool at the bottom of a blue water slide.\\" is it true that \\"A bee stings the young man.\\"?.

On the train to Chicago, Charles Drouet (Eddie Albert) approaches her. Although Carrie is reluctant to speak to him, the salesman persists and the two chat until they reach Chicago. Carrie gets off in South Chicago, the slums as Charles Drouet points out, after taking Drouet's business card. In South Chicago, Carrie stays with her sister, who is married and has one child. After an exhausting and fruitless day of job hunting, Carrie looks up Charles Drouet. He not only talks her into having dinner with him at Fitzgerald's, an upscale restaurant, but also gives her 10. Carrie heads to Fitzgerald's to return the money to Drouet. While there she meets George Hurstwood (Laurence Olivier), the manager of the restaurant, who is immediately smitten with her. Carrie ends up moving in with Drouet. He is a big talker but basically harmless. She pressures Drouet to marry her because the neighbors are talking about them. He tries to distract her and invites Hurstwood, whom he had run into by sheer coincidence, into their home. With Drouet's permission, Hurstwood takes Carrie to the theater while Drouet is on one of his many business trips. Hurstwood and Carrie end up spending every free minute together, and the two fall in love. Just before she is about to run off with Hurstwood, she finds out that he is married. She is distraught and confronts Hurstwood, who admits that he is married although terribly unhappy. At the restaurant, Hurstwood cashes up for the night and, by accidentally locking a timed safe, finds himself stuck with 10,000 of his boss's money.

The answer to this question is:","response":"The last step of the process, after the energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions, is the creation of seismic waves that cause the ground to shake, leading to an earthquake. When the energy builds up in the Earth's crust and reaches a critical point at or near fault lines, the enormous stress causes the fault to slip or give way. This movement of the Earth's plates along the fault line releases the stored energy in the form of seismic waves. There are mainly two types of seismic waves: Body waves and Surface waves. Body waves consist of Primary waves (P-waves) and Secondary waves (S-waves). Primary waves are the fastest-moving seismic waves and cause the ground to move back and forth, while Secondary waves move slower and cause the ground to move up and down as well as side to side. Surface waves, on the other hand, travel along the Earth's surface and cause the most damage due to their larger amplitudes and slower velocities. These seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface, causing the ground to shake as they pass through. This ground shaking is what we typically experience as an earthquake. The intensity of the shaking can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter, the depth of the earthquake's focus, and the type of geological materials and structures in the affected area. As the seismic waves propagate away from the epicenter, they lose energy and become weaker, resulting in diminishing shaking intensity. However, in some situations, the seismic waves can get trapped in sedimentary basins and amplify, leading to stronger shaking and more significant damage. In the aftermath of an earthquake, several secondary processes might occur. These include aftershocks – smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock and can cause further ground shaking and damage, potential landslides and rockfalls triggered by the initial shaking, and, in coastal areas, the possibility of tsunamis generated by underwater faults or landslides. In summary, the final step of the process after energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions is the generation of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth, causing ground shaking and resulting in an earthquake. This event can lead to varying levels of damage, depending on the specific conditions of each earthquake."},{"question":"Question: who played daniel boone son on tv series??

The first three chapters were published in magazines from 19331936, and the full book was published in 1937 by Covici Friede. The stories in the book are tales of a boy named Jody Tiflin. The book has four different stories about Jody and his life on his father's California ranch. Other main characters include Carl Tiflin - Jody's father; Billy Buck - an expert in horses and a working hand on the ranch; Mrs. Tiflin - Jody's mother; Jody's grandfather - Mrs. Tiflin's father, who has a history of crossing the Oregon Trail, and enjoys telling stories about his experiences; and Gitano - an old man who wishes to die at the Tiflin ranch. Along with these stories, there is a short story (taken from one of Steinbeck's earlier works, \\"The Pastures of Heaven\\") at the end of the book titled \\"Junius Maltby.\\" However, this last story is omitted in the edition published by Penguin Books. - John Ernst Steinbeck, Jr. (February 27, 1902 December 20, 1968) was an American author of 27 books, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and five collections of short stories.

It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the Corinthian Gulf and Nisaea, to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea. - Thucydides (\\"Thoukudíds\\", ; c. 460 c. 400 BC) was an Athenian historian and general. His \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" recounts the 5th century BC war between Sparta and Athens to the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \\"scientific history\\" because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work. - Acanthus the Lacedaemonian ( Ancient Greek : ) , was the victor in two footrace events , the diaulos ( ) and dolichos ( ) , in the Olympic Games of 720 BC. He was also , according to some accounts , the first who ran naked in these games . Other accounts ascribe this to Orsippus the Megarian . Thucydides says that the Lacedaemonians were indeed the first who contended naked in gymnastic games , although he does not mention Acanthus by name . - Orsippus was a Greek runner from Megara who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the Olympic Games and \\"first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked.\\" Others argue that it was Acanthus instead who first introduced Greek athletic nudity. Orsippus won the stadion-race of the 15th Olympic Games in 720 BC. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The History of the Peloponnesian War (Greek: \\"\\") is a historical account of the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC), which was fought between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens). It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian historian who also happened to serve as an Athenian general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The \\"History\\" is divided into eight books. - A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. What entity does 'acanthus of sparta' has the relation 'place of birth' with?

Question: suppose the climate changes radically happens, how will it affect there will be fewer floodgates. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","response":"Climate change can have significant effects on the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and flooding. With a radical shift in climate, there are likely to be alterations in precipitation patterns and hydrological processes, which could impact the occurrence and severity of floods in the area where the dam is built. Given this context, the potential effect of climate change on the need for floodgates in a dam would depend on the specific changes in precipitation and flood patterns in the region. Here are some possible scenarios: A: More floodgates needed: If the area becomes prone to more frequent and intense rain events due to climate change, the dam would experience an increased inflow of water. This would lead to a higher demand for floodgates to manage and release the water effectively to prevent catastrophic floods downstream. In this scenario, it would be necessary to construct additional floodgates to handle the influx of water brought on by the new climate. B: Less floodgates needed: Climate change could also result in longer dry spells or reduced precipitation in the region. If this were the case, there would likely be fewer instances of flooding that require the dam to release water using its floodgates. Consequently, the existing floodgates might suffice, and there would be a reduced need for additional structures. C: No effect: There is also the possibility that climate change would have no direct impact on the flooding frequency or intensity in the area, maintaining the current status quo. In this case, the number of floodgates needed would remain unchanged. Another important consideration for dam operations is the potential impacts of other climate change-driven factors, such as increased evaporation, glacial melting (if applicable to the region), or alterations in the timing of snowmelt. These factors could directly or indirectly influence the need for floodgates and the overall management of dams in the affected areas. In conclusion, the effect of climate change on floodgate requirements for a dam would depend on the specific changes in precipitation, flooding patterns, and other related factors in the region where the dam is built. Such changes could result in an increased need for floodgates, a reduced need, or no change at all, depending on the specific circumstances."},{"question":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the amount of men that represented 30 percent of the village of Little Thetford's population in 1911? The apothecary and botanist, William Sole (June 1741 February 1802), was born in Little Thetford and educated at King's School, Ely. Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

WASHINGTON — Four days before taking the oath of office, President Obama on Wednesday staked the beginning of his second term on an uphill quest to pass the broadest gun control legislation in a generation. In the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, Mr. Obama vowed to rally public opinion to press a reluctant Congress to ban military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expand background checks, and toughen gun-trafficking laws. Recognizing that the legislative fight could be long and difficult, the president also took immediate steps by issuing a series of executive actions intended to reduce gun violence. Surrounded by children who wrote him letters seeking curbs on guns, Mr. Obama committed himself to a high-profile and politically volatile campaign behind proposals assembled by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that will test the administration’s strength heading into the next four years. The first big push of Mr. Obama’s second term, then, will come on an issue that was not even on his to-do list on Election Day when voters renewed his lease on the presidency. “I will put everything I’ve got into this,” Mr. Obama said, “and so will Joe.” The emotionally charged ceremony, attended by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., reflected a decision by the White House to seize on public outrage to challenge the political power of the National Rifle Association and other forces that have successfully fought new gun laws for decades. The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president’s plan. “I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,” Mr. Obama said. “And, by the way, that doesn’t just mean from certain parts of the country. We’re going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can’t just be the usual suspects.” The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president’s speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an “elitist hypocrite” for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president’s other proposals. “Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,” the N.R.A. said in a statement. “Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.” Mr. Obama’s plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation’s database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns. Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama’s plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system. He also proposed legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor-piercing bullets and cracking down on “straw purchasers,” those who pass background checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them. For Mr. Obama, the plan represented a political pivot. While he has always expressed support for an assault weapons ban, he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there. But he and the White House are banking on the idea that the Newtown shooting has changed the dynamics. “I have never seen the nation’s conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday. “The world has changed and is demanding action.” Reporting was contributed by Charlie Savage, Jennifer Steinhauer and Jonathan Weisman.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","response":"Scalars and vectors are two types of quantities used to describe different aspects of physical phenomena. Scalars are quantities that have only magnitude, and they do not have direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, energy, and temperature. Scalars can be described by a single numerical value. Vectors, on the other hand, are quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, and force. Vectors are typically represented by an arrow that indicates the magnitude by its length and the direction by the arrowhead. Mathematically, vectors are typically described using components, which are the individual parts of the vector along each axis of the coordinate system. The reason why vectors have components and scalars don't is due to the directional aspect of vectors. Components are necessary to describe the direction of a vector in a coordinate system. A scalar, because it has no direction, does not require components to express its value. As for the last question, I assume you are asking if \\"Scalars vs. Vectors\\" and \\"Why do vectors have components and scalars don't?\\" have the same meaning.

Pick your answer from: I. yes II. it is not possible to tell III. no","response":"I. Yes The hypothesis \\"There isn't much on the island besides at the southeastern corner\\" seems to be supported by the information provided in the premise. According to the premise, the only area with any real development on the island is the southeastern corner. Chora, the island's only town, is located here, implying that the populated and more developed area is limited to this region. Additionally, the road system on the island is quite limited, with less than 10 km (16 miles) connecting the narrow streets of Chora to the beach at Milopotamos in the neighboring bay. This limited infrastructure suggests that the island is not extensively developed, with the main focus being on the southeastern corner. Furthermore, the premise does not mention any other significant development or areas of interest outside the southeastern corner of the island. Without any indication of notable settlements or attractions in other regions, it is reasonable to infer that the majority of the island remains less developed. Therefore, based on the available information, the hypothesis that there isn't much on the island besides at the southeastern corner is likely true."},{"question":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Article: Who hasn't enjoyed eating peanuts? Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Some trucks may only be able to dump the rocks in one big pile, but some trucks can let the rocks out a little at a time, spreading them across the span of your driveway, which will save you a lot of work. Use a wheelbarrow to distribute the rocks evenly along the length of your driveway. Then use your shovel and hard metal rake to spread the rocks evenly across the width of your driveway. You can also try driving over the area repeatedly with a heavy vehicle such as a large truck. If you only have one layer, you can move to the next step. Your driveway should be slightly elevated in the middle and lower on the sides to promote water drainage. You can achieve this by raking in from the sides towards the center so that the rocks are slightly piled higher in the center. You could also add some additional gravel down the center of your driveway and slowly scrape it towards the sides a little at a time. Don’t go too crazy with the grading; you don’t want your driveway to look like a pyramid. The ideal grade is very subtle, with the middle 2% to 5% higher than the sides. Be sure to “finish” your project by cleaning up. Remove the landscape stakes and twine markers. Put away or return tools that were rented or borrowed, and be sure to pay or thank anyone who helped you with the project. When necessary, rake gravel that gets displaced back into your driveway. Also think about adding gravel every two to three years to any low or bare spots that emerge over time.","response":"Some trucks can spread rocks on your driveway, making it easier to then use tools and vehicles to evenly distribute the rocks, create a subtle slope for water drainage, and maintain the driveway over time."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The definition states that we need to find the longest sequence of elements that can be found in both A and B while maintaining their relative order within each list. To solve this task, we can implement the dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the length of LCS encountered so far. Here's the step-by-step approach to find the LCS: 1. Create a 2D table \`lcs_table\` with the dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). Initialize all elements to 0. The extra row and column ensure that we can compare all elements from both lists. 2. Iterate through both lists A and B, and for each pair of elements (i, j), compare the elements from A and B. If the elements match, update the \`lcs_table[i+1][j+1]\` with the value \`lcs_table[i][j] + 1\`. This means that we've found a new element in the common subsequence, and we increase the LCS length by 1. 3. If the elements don't match, set the \`lcs_table[i+1][j+1]\` value to the maximum of \`lcs_table[i+1][j]\` and \`lcs_table[i][j+1]\`. This ensures that we store the maximum length of LCS we've encountered so far at each iteration. 4. After iterating through both lists, the longest common subsequence length is stored at \`lcs_table[len(A)][len(B)]\`. 5. To reconstruct the actual LCS, we can backtrack from the bottom-right corner of the table to the top-left corner, following the path of maximum LCS lengths. For the given input lists A and B, following the above steps, we can find the longest common subsequence: ['H', '3701', 'W', '7695', 'p', '9029', 't', 'w', '9717', '7583', 'X', '9033', '2223', 'm', '4639', '2381', '9365', 'd', '9177', 'V', '891', '5293', '3219', '2985', '2951', 'J']"},{"question":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Eggs provide structure, leavening, and flavor to baked goods, so their presence or absence will greatly impact the final product. The answer to the question \\"suppose eggs are used in the batter happens, how will it affect the cake will not rise?\\" would be option A: more rise. Here is a detailed explanation of the roles eggs play in the cake-making process, which can help you understand why their presence will cause the cake to rise more: 1. Structure: The proteins in eggs set when exposed to heat, providing structure and stability to the cake. This helps to maintain the shape of the cake and prevents it from collapsing after being removed from the oven. The proteins also help the cake maintain its soft and tender texture. Without eggs, the cake may have difficulty maintaining its structure and might become crumbly and unstable. 2. Leavening: Eggs are natural leavening agents, which means they help the cake rise during baking. When the proteins in eggs coagulate, or set, they create pockets of air that expand as the cake bakes. This allows the cake to rise, creating a desirable light and fluffy texture. Additionally, the water in eggs turns to steam during the baking process, which also contributes to the leavening effect. In the absence of eggs, the cake might not rise as much, resulting in a denser and less airy texture. 3. Flavor: Eggs add richness and flavor to the cake batter. The fats in the egg yolks contribute to the overall flavor of the cake, while the proteins in the egg whites add a subtle, complementary taste. Removing eggs from the recipe may affect the taste of the cake, making it less flavorful or altering its overall flavor profile. 4. Emulsification: Eggs act as emulsifiers, helping to blend different ingredients that may not mix well together, such as fat and water. This creates a uniform batter, which is crucial for producing a tender, consistent cake. Without eggs, the batter might separate, resulting in uneven cooking and an inconsistent texture. In conclusion, using eggs in the batter will result in a cake that rises more because eggs provide structure, leavening, flavor, and emulsification in the baking process. In the absence of eggs, the cake may be denser, less flavorful, and less stable."},{"question":"I read this background article the other day: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Bill is the person who didn't start avoiding carcinogens. Danny and Bill both read about lifestyle choices and how these influence the risk of getting cancer. After being informed about the dangers of carcinogens and their connection to cancer, Danny chose to make drastic healthier lifestyle changes to minimize his exposure to carcinogens and reduce his risk of developing cancer. In contrast, Bill continued with his former habits that expose him to various carcinogens, such as maintaining a fast-food diet, visiting tanning salons, and smoking tobacco. A fast-food diet is often high in processed and unhealthy ingredients, which can potentially contain carcinogenic substances. Moreover, the cooking methods used to prepare these foods, such as frying, may also introduce carcinogens. Tanning salons expose the skin to artificial UV radiation, which is known to increase the risk of skin cancer. Finally, smoking tobacco is a well-documented cause of various cancers, particularly lung cancer, as tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogenic compounds. In summary, although both Danny and Bill were educated about the association between carcinogens and cancer, it was Bill who failed to avoid these harmful substances and did not make the necessary lifestyle changes to reduce his risk of developing cancer. Danny, on the other hand, took precautionary measures to avoid carcinogens by adopting healthier habits."},{"question":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the people who race around New York?

Although their acts bring laughter and intrigue to their audiences, the question \\"Who is a clown?\\" remains a curious mystery to both the city and the performers themselves. The story begins as Jang-saeng, a skilled and highly respected performer, discovers Gong-gil, a mysterious and talented young man, in an abandoned circus tent. Sensing great potential in Gong-gil, Jang-saeng takes him under his wing and together, they form an unbeatable duo.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","response":"The first step of the process of respiration in the lungs is inhalation, which involves the following: 1. Diaphragm contracts: The diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs, contracts and flattens. This increases the volume of the chest cavity and creates a negative pressure inside. 2. Intercostal muscles contract: The intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, also contract, lifting the rib cage up and outward. This further increases the chest cavity's volume. 3. Air rushes in: Due to the increased volume and negative pressure inside the chest cavity, air rushes into the lungs through the nose or mouth. It then passes through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea, eventually reaching the bronchi and bronchioles. 4. Airways branch out: The bronchi and bronchioles in the lungs form an extensive network of airways that further branch out and end in small sacs called alveoli. 5. Exchange of gases: Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the surrounding capillaries while carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli. This process is known as gas exchange. So, the first step of the process is the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, which allows inhalation and leads to the series of events that result in the exchange of gases in the lungs."},{"question":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Casey was getting ready for winter and cleared all water lines outside.

His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. Context: The Civil War erupted within two months of Buchanan's retirement. He supported the United States, writing to former colleagues that \\"the assault upon Sumter was the commencement of war by the Confederate states, and no alternative was left but to prosecute it with vigor on our part\\". He also wrote a letter to his fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, urging them to \\"join the many thousands of brave & patriotic volunteers who are already in the field\\". Buchanan spent most of his remaining years defending himself from public blame for the Civil War, which was even referred to by some as \\"Buchanan's War\\". He began receiving angry and threatening letters daily, and stores displayed Buchanan's likeness with the eyes inked red, a noose drawn around his neck and the word \\"TRAITOR\\" written across his forehead. The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly. Initially so disturbed by the attacks that he fell ill and depressed, Buchanan finally began defending himself in October 1862, in an exchange of letters between himself and Winfield Scott that was published in the National Intelligencer newspaper. He soon began writing his fullest public defense, in the form of his memoir Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion, which was published in 1866. Buchanan caught a cold in May 1868, which quickly worsened due to his advanced age. He died on June 1, 1868, from respiratory failure at the age of 77 at his home at Wheatland and was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster. Question: What happened in his final years?. Whats the answer?","response":"In James Buchanan's final years, he faced a lot of criticism and blame for the Civil War. People called it \\"Buchanan's War\\" and even labeled him a traitor. At first, he was very upset and became ill, but later he decided to defend himself. He wrote letters and a memoir to explain his side of the story. In his last days, he got a cold which became worse because he was old.

As the evening progressed, Lawrence couldn't resist the bowl of mixed nuts on the table. The saltiness mixed with the varying textures of almonds, cashews, and pecans made it difficult for him to stop munching on them. Adam, on the other hand, preferred different types of snacks and was content with the occasional handful of nuts. While eating the salty nuts, Lawrence sipped a refreshing cold beverage, which only seemed to make the nuts more enticing. As they sat on the couch engaged in conversation, Lawrence continued to dip his hand into the bowl of nuts, enjoying the satisfying crunch that accompanied every bite. Since the nuts were positioned within Lawrence's reach, and he enjoyed them so much, his natural instinct was to continuously eat them. Adam, on the other hand, wasn't as much of a fan of salty snacks, preferring sweeter alternatives. He had a small plate of chocolate chip cookies nearby, which he nibbled on from time to time. He liked the sweet and comforting taste of the cookies and felt that there was no reason to force himself to eat more nuts than he wanted. Adam's fondness for his dessert allowed Lawrence to eat more nuts without feeling guilty about it. As the evening came to an end, the bowl of nuts was nearly empty. Lawrence, still enjoying the taste of the salty snack, felt no regret about indulging in his favorite type of treat. Adam, who barely consumed half the cookies, was satisfied with his self-restraint and was glad that both of them were able to have something they loved. In conclusion, it was Lawrence's preference for salty snacks that led him to eat more nuts than Adam did, while Adam's inclination towards sweet treats like cookies made him content with a smaller portion of nuts. This scenario highlighted how individual tastes and preferences played a significant role in their snacking habits."},{"question":"Their 1988 follow-up album, He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper, made them multi-platinum stars.

Nevertheless, the single was a success, launching the group into even more mainstream stardom. The video showed Prince's misadventures of trying to get around his parents' strict rules in a very comical way, very much like their first single \\"Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble\\". It gained much airplay on TV channels such as MTV, giving the group much attention. The song was played in an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (\\"Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect (Part 1)\\"), and referenced in two other episodes of the same series (\\"The Fresh Prince Project\\" and \\"Not With My Pig, You Don't\\"). Another single, \\"Nightmare on My Street\\", showcased a fictional confrontation with movie villain Freddy Krueger. Coinciding with the release of the fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film (1988's The Dream Master); New Line Cinema was not pleased. A video allegedly shot for the single was buried, and a disclaimer was hastily included on pressings of the album indicating that the record was not officially affiliated with any of the Nightmare films. (Ironically, Jive Records ended up releasing the soundtrack to the next film in the series, The Dream Child.) After this success, in 1988 the lead singles from Rock the House, including \\"Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble\\", were re-released and changed a bit from their original 1985 release, with the outro referencing singles \\"Nightmare on My Street\\" and \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\": Jeff: Man, first your parents just don't understand.Will: Word, I know, man.Jeff: Then you have these crazy nightmares.Will: Why me?

The song, inspired by the political climate of the time and the banning of slam dancing in certain clubs, became a symbolic anthem that encourages people to passionately express themselves without the fear of being judged or restricted. Its unique, upbeat tempo combined with catchy lyrics quickly caught the attention of listeners around the world. The music video for \\"The Safety Dance\\" further contributed to the song's popularity. It was directed by Tim Pope and shot in the UK, depicting Ivan Doroschuk as a medieval jester leading a parade of peculiar characters through the village streets. The music video's unique choreography, using only the hands and arms, made it a visually captivating piece. The song climbed the charts internationally, reaching the top 10 in various countries, including Australia, Canada, and the UK. In the United States, it peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and rose to number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's widespread success made Men Without Hats a well-known name in the music industry during the 1980s. Despite the group's continued musical endeavors, none of their subsequent releases managed to achieve the same level of success as \\"The Safety Dance.\\" However, their contribution to the new wave and synth-pop era remains a significant milestone in the history of popular music, with their only chart entry leaving a lasting impression on the global audience."},{"question":"Tribunal says that until December, GCHQ was too secretive about how it shared data. This meant UK intelligence agency contravened European law on right to privacy. UK Home Office says government is committed to transparency and complies with law. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: GCHQ's Previous Data Sharing Policies Criticized for Infringement of Privacy Rights In a revealing ruling, a tribunal has found that, until December, the UK intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had been showing excessive secrecy over its data-sharing methods. The tribunal's decision suggests that these practices contravened European law, particularly in regards to the right to privacy. I started the introduction with a summary of the main point, addressing the tribunal's ruling about GCHQ's excessive secrecy. It is important to provide this context to the reader in the beginning for them to properly understand the rest of the details. GCHQ, which plays a crucial role in national security and overseas intelligence, has been criticized for not being transparent enough about how it shares information. The tribunal noted that until December, GCHQ's practices had the potential to violate citizen's rights to privacy—an overarching principle protected under European law. In this second paragraph, I am unraveling more details about the GCHQ and what its function is. This is a good way of providing background information to the reader. I also briefly mention the potential implications of their non-transparent practices. Elaborating on the matter, the tribunal said the agency was not providing enough public information about the important safeguards that regulate how data is passed to foreign governments and UK law enforcement departments. The way GCHQ was handling and sharing information until recently contravened the privacy rights of individuals, established under the European Convention of Human Rights. With this paragraph, I’m providing a more detailed explanation of why the tribunal found the GCHQ's practices as contravening privacy rights. It is essential to lay out the specifics of the issue for the readers to fully comprehend the tribunal's concerns. While the tribunal's judgment is a significant setback, the UK Home Office reiterated the government's commitment to transparency. It stated that the government is fully resolved to comply with all legal frameworks, an explicit reference to the criticism levied at GCHQ. In this paragraph, I am incorporating the response from the UK Home Office to maintain a balanced view and offer readers insight into how the government is addressing the concerns raised by the tribunal. Reporting the government's standpoint is crucial to present the entire narrative. Given that the tribunal's criticism of GCHQ only relates to practices until December, it’s apparent that changes have been enacted to address these concerns. It remains to be seen how effective such changes have been and whether they will fulfill the government's commitment to transparency, whilst still ensuring national security. In the conclusion, I'm speculating about the possible effects of this judgment. Giving readers a sense of future developments effectively rounds out the article and paves the way for further reporting. To conclude, I'm re-emphasizing on the crux of the issue: a balance between privacy and national security. Throughout the article, I focused on presenting the facts clearly and objectively, which is the essence of good journalism."},{"question":"the period of opening freedom and opportunity which began in the eighteen hundreds had reached its golden climax. every door was open.

Men with beer belly forecast to die 17 years before those with thin stomach. Analysis carried out by former government advisor Margaret Ashwell. Fat around the middle wraps around organs and increases blood pressure. Raises the risk of health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: The Silent Killer: How Belly Fat Reduces Life Expectancy Introduction: The term \\"beer belly\\" is often used in a light-hearted manner to describe the appearance of a protruding stomach, typically in men, resulting from fat accumulation around the abdominal area. While it may be seen as a harmless joke, recent research and analysis conducted by former government advisor Margaret Ashwell revealed that individuals with excess abdominal fat have an alarmingly reduced life expectancy. Men with a beer belly could be at risk of dying up to 17 years earlier than their leaner counterparts. The Dangers of Abdominal Fat: In contrast with subcutaneous fat, which is stored just beneath the skin, the fat that accumulates around the midsection wraps itself around vital organs such as the stomach, liver, intestines, and pancreas. This visceral fat not only increases blood pressure but also releases harmful inflammatory chemicals and hormones, which can ultimately lead to a myriad of health issues. Excess abdominal fat has been directly linked to a higher risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and respiratory illnesses. Life Expectancy Impact: Margaret Ashwell's analysis unearthed alarming findings about the link between abdominal fat and life expectancy. Men with a beer belly are now forecasted to die up to 17 years earlier than those sporting a flat stomach. This staggering statistic highlights the urgent need for individuals with excess abdominal fat to take action in order to improve their overall health and extend their life expectancy. Why Belly Fat is More Dangerous: The reason behind abdominal fat being more dangerous than fat stored in other areas of the body lies in its proximity to essential organs. Fat pressing against these vital organs can impair their functioning, leading to inflammation and the production of harmful chemicals. Specifically, visceral fat generates a hormone called angiotensinogen, which accelerates blood pressure, increasing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, the fat cells around the waist secrete even more inflammatory cytokines-chemical messengers that further exacerbate health problems. Preventative Measures to Reduce Abdominal Fat: Tackling the issue of abdominal fat is not only critical for one's overall health but also for extending one's life expectancy. Implementing healthy lifestyle changes can significantly reduce excess belly fat and lower the risk of developing serious health conditions. The following are a few suggested preventative measures: 1. Balanced diet: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your daily meals. Limit the consumption of sugary and processed foods that contribute to weight gain and the formation of harmful visceral fat. 2. Regular exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups. 3. Stress management: High levels of stress can lead to hormone imbalances that encourage fat accumulation around the midsection. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help in managing stress levels more effectively. 4. Adequate sleep: Aim for six to eight hours of sleep per night to maintain hormonal balance and support overall health. 5. Alcohol moderation: Limit alcohol intake as excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain, specifically around the abdominal area. Conclusion: While \\"beer belly\\" may seem like a benign term, its implications are far more serious than just an aesthetic concern. Excess abdominal fat is a significant risk factor for numerous health problems, ultimately leading to a shortened life expectancy. By embracing a healthier lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and alcohol moderation, individuals can effectively combat this silent killer and lead a happier, healthier, and longer life."},{"question":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The Château du Plessis-Bourré is privately owned.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","response":"Concept 1: - Château du Plessis-Bourré: a big, fancy house in France, like a castle - privately owned: belongs to a person or a family, not the government - The connection: The Château du Plessis-Bourré is owned by a person or a family.

However, it's essential to understand that Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. As time goes by, Grant realizes that Fiona's dementia is genuine and not an act to get back at him. He is faced with the painful truth that the love of his life is deteriorating and losing her memory of their time together. One of the crucial themes in the movie is the exploration of relationships, commitment, and the effects of dementia on families. Throughout the film, Grant learns to let go of his jealousy and suspicions to prioritize Fiona's happiness and well-being. He even develops a tentative relationship with Marian, Aubrey's wife, and takes part in reuniting Fiona and Aubrey to make Fiona happy. In conclusion, Grant initially thinks Fiona's dementia might be an act to punish him for his previous unfaithfulness. However, as the movie progresses, he comes to terms with the reality of her condition and focuses on providing love, support, and happiness to her, even if it means letting her grow closer to someone else. Ultimately, the film delves into the complexities of love, commitment, and coping with the challenges that Alzheimer's disease brings to the lives of patients and their families."},{"question":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Boasting a star-studded cast including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine, the film successfully meshes heart-pounding action with deep emotional resonance. Set in the not-too-distant future where Earth is on the brink of collapse due to extreme environmental degradation, the film follows former NASA pilot turned farmer, Joseph Cooper (McConaughey), as he is recruited for a secret mission to find a new habitable planet for humanity. Joined by a team of scientists led by Amelia Brand (Hathaway) and guided by the enigmatic Professor Brand (Caine), they embark on a space odyssey that takes them through wormholes, black holes, and multiple dimensions. Visually, Interstellar is an absolute masterpiece, with breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema and stunning visual effects that bring the alien planets and celestial phenomena to life. The shots of deep space, planetary surfaces, and time-bending anomalies create a bewildering and immersive experience, reinforcing the film's overarching message of human ingenuity and exploration in the face of uncertainty. Nolan's storytelling and direction shine in this film. He takes complex scientific concepts such as relativity and time dilation and skillfully weaves them into the plot, giving the viewer both intellectual and emotional payoffs. The story jumps between the personal struggles of Cooper, his daughter Murph (Chastain), and the space team's odyssey, ensuring that the film's pace never wanes. McConaughey delivers a powerful performance as Cooper, embodying the brave but tortured humanitarian hero. As the stoic commander, Hathaway balances vulnerability and determination with aplomb. The supporting cast, including Michael Caine and Jessica Chastain, bring their own emotional depth to the film, with Caine representing humanity's more practical and cynical side whereas Chastain's Murph symbolizes hope and determination to persevere. The film's sound design and score, both by the legendary Hans Zimmer, create an evocative and otherworldly atmosphere that aids in plunging the audience into the heart of the story. Zimmer's organ-heavy soundtrack echoes the film's themes of exploration and sacrifice, instilling the sense of awe and wonder that one expects from a journey into the unknown. However, Interstellar is not without its flaws. At times, the dialogue can feel a tad overly expository, with characters explaining scientific concepts to each other that would be better left for the audience to decipher themselves. Some viewers might also find the movie's nearly three-hour runtime daunting, but it is essential for building the intricate narrative and accompanying character arcs. Despite these minor drawbacks, Interstellar remains a thought-provoking, visually arresting film that showcases Christopher Nolan's talents as both a storyteller and a visionary. Balancing the weighty themes of love, time, and our place in the cosmos, this science fiction opus is a must-see for fans of the genre and cinema enthusiasts alike.

Fortunately, Deal Chicken offered a 100 4-course meal and a bottle of wine for 4 people. Definitely worth the experience for that price. First of all the building and all the neighboring stores are dark at night. Not a very inviting complex if you've never been to the area. However, the interior is decorated and set up very nicely, typical of a traditional steakhouse. Be sure to ask for table with dual tops if you want to try different fondues. Kind of silly to force 4 people to agree on one item imo. Since we sat at a double stove, we got two cheese fondues, everyone had a house or ceased salad, then we get two entree hot pots (mojo and regular), then two desserts (we had yin/yang and bananas foster). Overall the food quality was very good with a few misses. Bread pieces were cold and stale. Cake/cheesecake were dry. The house wine was pretty awful for this caliber restaurant, but I guess it never claims to be a wine place. I didn't have problems with the filet as some others said.

The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Colorful leaves: This phrase is the main subject of the photograph. This indicates that the leaves are vibrant and attractive in color, likely showing the various shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown characteristic of autumn foliage. Since the main focus of the sentence is on these leaves, this phrase carries significant importance. 3. Waving: This word suggests the dynamic aspect of the image or video, depicting the leaves in motion rather than just static. It conveys a sense of life and vitality in the scene being represented, as well as adding visual interest to the composition. 4. Wind: This element provides the context for the leaves' movement, which is a result of the wind's influence. It adds an additional layer of depth to the scene, making it feel more natural and authentic. 5.

Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Get out a few baking sheets and lay parchment on them to prevent the rugelach from sticking to the pans as they bake. Remove the disks of chilled rugelach dough from the refrigerator and let them set out for a few minutes. You should have your filling(s) ready and set aside before you roll the dough out. Unwrap one of the disks and sprinkle your work space with some powdered sugar. This will keep the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to a rectangle that's 12-inches (30 cm) wide by 7 to 8-inches long (17.5 to 20 cm). Keep the wide side of the rectangle towards you so you can easily roll it into a log later. Take the prepared filling of your choice and place a quarter of it onto the dough circle. Use an offset spatula or the back of a large spoon to spread the filling evenly across the dough. Leave 1/4-inch (6 mm) edge bare on the side that's closest to you. This will help seal the dough together when you roll it up. You'll need about 2 to 4 tablespoons of filling for each log. Hold the edge of the rugelach that's closest to you. It should be the long, bare edge. Use your fingertips to gently roll the dough over the filling. Continue tightly rolling the dough to make a log. Pinch the ends together to form tight seals. Set the log on a baking sheet in the freezer and chill it for 10 to 15 minutes. Chilling the log will make it easier to cut. Roll out and fill the remaining logs of dough once you've finished the initial portion of dough. Consider filling each log with a different flavor of filling. Remove the logs from the freezer and cut away the ends of each log so they're neat. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 10 to 12 pieces, depending on how thick you want them. Place the rugelach slices cut-side down on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there are a few inches (5 cm) of space between the rugelach. Bake the rugelach for 20 to 25 minutes. They should turn golden brown. Giving the rugelach space will prevent them from baking into one another.","response":"This article provides step-by-step instructions on preparing and baking rugelach, with emphasis on rolling out the dough, applying fillings, rolling the dough into logs, cutting the logs into slices, and baking them to golden brown perfection."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line.

This choice is incorrect because it talks about giving toys or treats as a reward, which is not related to showing affection as a reward mentioned in the paragraph. Giving things like a lip lock, a ribbon, or candy is not showing affection. b. This choice is also incorrect because it is negative and confusing. It does not provide a clear ending to the paragraph about rewarding with affection. It may confuse a five-year-old. d. Giving a toy or a treat like a peanut is again not related to showing affection as a reward. This choice talks about adding an element of exercise, which is not mentioned in the paragraph as the focus is on good behavior and expressing affection as a reward."},{"question":"Answer the following question: The judge thought Geoffrey Payne killed his wife. Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? In this passage Payne tried to _ . A) show he was sorry for his wife's death B) show he was guilty for murdering his wife C) tell why his wife was killed that night D) say the man in the road was probably the murderer Answer:","response":"D) say the man in the road was probably the murderer"},{"question":"Who wrote the Art Garfunkel number one hit 'Bright Eyes'????","response":"\\"Bright Eyes\\" is a song written by British singer-songwriter Mike Batt. It was originally composed for the 1978 animated film adaptation of Richard Adams' novel, \\"Watership Down.\\" In the film, the song is performed by Art Garfunkel, who turned it into a massive hit. Art Garfunkel, best known as half of the Simon & Garfunkel duo, provided his distinct and expressive vocals to the song. However, the creative mind behind \\"Bright Eyes\\" is Mike Batt, a versatile composer, musician, and producer known for his work in various genres, primarily pop and classical music. After the song's inclusion in \\"Watership Down,\\" it gained significant recognition and became a number one hit in the United Kingdom for six weeks in 1979. The success of \\"Bright Eyes\\" went beyond UK borders, reaching top positions in international charts across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States, the song achieved a more modest chart position at number 29 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song's emotional associations with the film, as well as its poignant lyrics addressing life, death, and transition, resonated with many listeners and turned \\"Bright Eyes\\" into one of the most memorable hits of the late 1970s. Although it was not written by Art Garfunkel himself, his captivating performance undoubtedly helped elevate Mike Batt's songwriting and made \\"Bright Eyes\\" an enduring classic."},{"question":"Attributes: name = Browns Cambridge, priceRange = cheap.

'' asked danny , not able to see the effect of the","response":"shroud on Yune. \\"Yes, it worked,\\" Yune reassured Danny, continuing to monitor his patient closely. In stealth mode, the suit became virtually invisible, making it perfect for missions requiring stealth and discretion. The nanotechnology embedded in the fabric allowed it to bend light around the wearer, rendering them almost invisible to the naked eye. The HUD displayed various information that would be essential in their mission. It provided a real-time map of the wearer's surroundings, highlighting potential hazards and updating the wearer on the location of any nearby allies or teammates. The suit also offered access to a wide array of tools that could aid in navigation, communication, and defense. Confident in the suit's effectiveness, Danny turned his focus to the task at hand. They had been assigned a daring mission: to infiltrate an enemy stronghold and retrieve vital intelligence that could turn the tide of a brewing conflict. The stealth suit would be crucial in avoiding detection and ensuring their success. As Yune kept a close eye on his patient's vitals, he couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and concern. They had practiced for this moment countless times, but the stakes had never been higher. The information they sought was said to be held deep within the heart of the enemy's operative center, guarded by several layers of high-tech security and skilled personnel. Yune knew better than anyone that the margin for error was incredibly narrow. One misstep could not only compromise the mission but also jeopardize the lives of his team members. However, this was their chance to make a significant difference in the struggle that had gripped the world, and Yune was determined to do everything in his power to ensure their success. As the team members made their final preparations, they synchronized their stealth suits and loaded their high-tech weapons. Yune maintained constant communication with the other team members, ensuring they were all aware of their roles and the plan they had to execute. They set out as a cohesive unit, with Yune providing critical medical support and monitoring the overall health of the team. The journey through the heavily fortified enemy territory was grueling and perilous, but the stealth suits' state-of-the-art technology allowed them to slide past unsuspecting guards and automated security measures. As they neared their target, the team paused to assess the situation. The intelligence they sought was located within a central control room, protected by a series of complex locks and seemingly impenetrable defenses. Whisper, their tech expert, set to work on disabling the security systems while Yune continued to care for the team's health and stability. The tension in the air grew thicker with every passing moment as the remaining team members stood watch, ready to provide backup and assistance when needed. They knew the value of the intelligence they sought, as well as the danger that lay ahead. When Whisper finally signaled that he had successfully bypassed the security measures and accessed the control room, the team exhaled collectively, successful in their mission. They hurriedly retrieved the data they sought and began their quiet withdrawal, making sure to leave no trace of their infiltration. Upon returning to their base, Yune, Whisper, Danny, and the rest of the team felt an immense weight lifted from their shoulders. They knew that they had risked everything in pursuit of the mission, and their lives had hung in the balance at every turn. Yet, they had persevered, and now the intelligence they had gathered offered a glimmer of hope. As they debriefed and celebrated their victory, Yune felt an overwhelming sense of pride mingle with his exhaustion. He knew that his expert care of the team's health and well-being had been a key factor in their success - proof that he was more than prepared to face any challenge that the future may hold."},{"question":"Universal Studios: Universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars, and often borrowed talent from other studios, or hired freelance actors.

Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money.

Chain of thought:","response":"To determine whether all Tahiti hotels could hypothetically accommodate the US D-Day troops, we need to consider the number of US troops involved in D-Day and the total hotel capacity in Tahiti. The D-Day invasion, also known as Operation Overlord, occurred on June 6, 1944. On that day, around 73,000 US troops took part in the invasion, including paratroopers, infantry, and support personnel. It's important to note that D-Day involved a total of over 156,000 Allied troops, but for this analysis, we will only consider the US troops. Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, located in the South Pacific Ocean. The island is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful beaches, overwater bungalows, and luxurious resorts. As of 2021, there are around 55 hotels and resorts on the island, ranging from luxury establishments to family-run guesthouses. However, since we are discussing a hypothetical scenario set during the World War II era, we will consider the current capacity of these hotels while keeping in mind that the number of accommodations could have been different back then. For example, let's consider an average of 100 rooms per hotel, which could accommodate up to 200 guests, assuming double occupancy (2 guests per room). However, since the hotel industry today is highly developed compared to the 1940s, the average number of rooms per hotel may likely have been lower during that time. Using the hypothetical scenario of 55 hotels, each containing 100 rooms, we get: 55 hotels * 100 rooms/hotel * 2 guests/room = 11,000 guests This estimated capacity of 11,000 guests would fall short of accommodating the 73,000 US troops that took part in the D-Day invasion. In conclusion, it is highly unlikely that all Tahiti hotels could have hypothetically accommodated the 73,000 US troops involved in the D-Day invasion. Besides, in a realistic World War II setting, relocating such a large military force to a distant location like Tahiti for accommodation purposes would not have been strategically feasible."},{"question":"Then in 1949 he went to Lvov when he became the Chairman of branch of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Add punctuation.","response":"Then, in 1949, he went to Lvov, when he became the Chairman of the Branch of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Stan Lee, the legendary writer, editor and publisher of Marvel Comics whose fantabulous but flawed creations made him a real-life superhero to comic book lovers everywhere, has died. He was 95. Lee, who began in the business in 1939 and created or co-created Black Panther, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Daredevil and Ant-Man, among countless other characters, died early Monday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a family representative told The Hollywood Reporter. Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee, also confirmed his death to the Associated Press. Lee's final few years were tumultuous. After Joan, his wife of 69 years, died in July 2017, he sued executives at POW! Entertainment — a company he founded in 2001 to develop film, TV and video game properties — for 1 billion alleging fraud, then abruptly dropped the suit weeks later. He also sued his ex-business manager and filed for a restraining order against a man who had been handling his affairs. (Lee's estate is estimated to be worth as much as 70 million.) And in June 2018, it was revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department had been investigating reports of elder abuse against him. On his own and through his work with frequent artist-writer collaborators Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others, Lee catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world's No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant. In 2009, The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment for 4 billion, and most of the top-grossing superhero films of all time — led by Avengers: Infinity War's 2.05 billion worldwide take earlier this year — have featured Marvel characters. \\"I used to think what I did was not very important,\\" he told the Chicago Tribune in April 2014. \\"People are building bridges and engaging in medical research, and here I was doing stories about fictional people who do extraordinary, crazy things and wear costumes. But I suppose I have come to realize that entertainment is not easily dismissed.\\" Lee's fame and influence as the face and figurehead of Marvel, even in his nonagenarian years, remained considerable. “Stan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created,\\" Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. \\"A superhero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart.\\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige also paid tribute. “No one has had more of an impact on my career and everything we do at Marvel Studios than Stan Lee,\\" Feige said. \\"Stan leaves an extraordinary legacy that will outlive us all. Our thoughts are with his daughter, his family and the millions of fans who have been forever touched by Stan’s genius, charisma and heart. Excelsior!” Beginning in the 1960s, the irrepressible and feisty Lee punched up his Marvel superheroes with personality, not just power. Until then, comic book headliners like those of DC Comics were square and well-adjusted, but his heroes had human foibles and hang-ups; Peter Parker/Spider-Man, for example, fretted about his dandruff and was confused about dating. The evildoers were a mess of psychological complexity. \\"His stories taught me that even superheroes like Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk have ego deficiencies and girl problems and do not live in their macho fantasies 24 hours a day,\\" Gene Simmons of Kiss said in a 1979 interview. \\"Through the honesty of guys like Spider-Man, I learned about the shades of gray in human nature.\\" (Kiss made it to the Marvel pages, and Lee had Simmons bleed into a vat of ink so the publisher could say the issues were printed with his blood.) The Manhattan-born Lee wrote, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series and newspaper strips. He also penned a monthly comics column, “Stan's Soapbox,” signing off with his signature phrase, “Excelsior!” His way of doing things at Marvel was to brainstorm a story with an artist, then write a synopsis. After the artist drew the story panels, Lee filled in the word balloons and captions. The process became known as “The Marvel Method.” Lee collaborated with artist-writer Kirby on the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Silver Surfer and X-Men. With artist-writer Ditko he created Spider-Man and the surgeon Doctor Strange, and with artist Bill Everett came up with the blind superhero Daredevil. Such collaborations sometimes led to credit disputes: Lee and Ditko reportedly engaged in bitter fights, and both receive writing credit on the Spider-Man movies and TV shows. \\"I don't want anyone to think I treated Kirby or Ditko unfairly,\\" he told Playboy magazine in April 2014. \\"I think we had a wonderful relationship. Their talent was incredible. But the things they wanted weren't in my power to give them.\\" Like any Marvel employee, Lee had no rights to the characters he helped create and received no royalties. In the 1970s, Lee importantly helped push the boundaries on censorship in comics, delving into serious and topical subject matter in a medium that had become mindless, kid-friendly entertainment. In 1954, the publication of psychologist Frederic Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent had spurred calls for the government to regulate violence, sex, drug use, questioning of public authority figures, etc., in the comics as a way to curtail \\"juvenile delinquency.\\" Wary publishers headed that off by forming the Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body that while avoiding the heavy hand of Washington still wound up neutering adult interest in comics and stereotyping the medium as one only kids would enjoy. Lee scripted banal scenarios with characters like Nellie the Nurse and Tessie the Typist, but in 1971, he inserted an anti-drug storyline into \\"The Amazing Spider-Man” in which Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn popped pills. Those issues, which did not carry the CCA \\"seal of approval\\" on the covers, became extremely popular, and later, the organization relaxed some of its guidelines. Born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, he grew up poor in Washington Heights, where his father, a Romanian immigrant, was a dress-cutter. A lover of adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, Lee graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project, where he appeared in a few stage shows, and wrote obituaries. In 1939, Lee got a job as a gofer for 8 a week at Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Two years later, for Kirby and Joe Simon's Captain America No. 3, he wrote a two-page story titled \\"The Traitor's Revenge!\\" that was used as text filler to qualify the company for the inexpensive magazine mailing rate. He used the pen name Stan Lee. He was named interim editor at 19 by publisher Martin Goodman when the previous editor quit. In 1942, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Signal Corps, where he wrote manuals and training films with a group that included Oscar-winner Frank Capra, Pulitzer-winner William Saroyan and Theodor Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). After the war, he returned to the publisher and served as the editor for decades. Following DC Comics' lead with the Justice League, Lee and Kirby in November 1961 launched their own superhero team, the Fantastic Four, for the newly renamed Marvel Comics, and Hulk, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Daredevil and X-Men soon followed. The Avengers launched as its own title in September 1963. Perhaps not surprisingly, Manhattan's high-literary culture vultures did not bestow its approval on how Lee was making a living. People would “avoid me like I had the plague. … Today, it's so different,” he once told The Washington Post. Not everyone felt the same way, though. Lee recalled once being visiting in his New York office by Federico Fellini, who wanted to talk about nothing but Spider-Man. In 1972, Lee was named publisher and relinquished the Marvel editorial reins to spend all his time promoting the company. He moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to set up an animation studio and to build relationships in Hollywood. Lee purchased a home overlooking the Sunset Strip that was once owned by Jack Benny's announcer, Don Wilson. Long before his Marvel characters made it to the movies, they appeared on television. An animated Spider-Man show (with a memorable theme song composed by Oscar winner Paul Francis Webster, of \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" fame, and Bob Harris) ran on ABC from 1967 to 1970. Bill Bixby played Dr. David Banner, who turns into a green monster (Lou Ferrigno) when he gets agitated, in the 1977-82 CBS drama The Incredible Hulk. And Pamela Anderson provided the voice of Stripperella, a risque animated Spike TV series that Lee wrote for in 2003-04. Lee launched the internet-based Stan Lee Media in 1998, and the superhero creation, production and marketing studio went public a year later. However, when investigators uncovered illegal stock manipulation by his partners, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. (Lee was never charged.) In 2002, Lee published an autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee. Survivors include his daughter and younger brother Larry Lieber, a writer and artist for Marvel. Another daughter, Jan, died in infancy. His wife, Joan, was a hat model whom he married in 1947. Like Alfred Hitchcock before him, the never-bashful Lee appeared in cameos in the Marvel movies, shown avoiding falling concrete, watering his lawn, delivering the mail, crashing a wedding, playing a security guard, etc. In Spider-Man 3 (2007), he chats with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker as they stop on a Times Square street to read news that the web-slinger will soon receive the key to the city. “You know,\\" he says, \\"I guess one person can make a difference … 'nuff said.” Duane Byrge and Borys Kit contributed to this report. ||||| Stan Lee Dead at 95 Marvel Comics Legend Stan Lee Dead at 95 EXCLUSIVE Stan Lee, the man responsible for much of the Marvel Universe, has died ... Stan's daughter tells TMZ. We're told an ambulance rushed to Lee's Hollywood Hills home early Monday morning and he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. We're told that's where he died. Lee had suffered several illnesses over the last year or so -- he had a bout of pneumonia and vision issues. Stan started Marvel with Jack Kirby in 1961 with The Fantastic Four. He went on to create Spider-Man, Black Panther, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, Iron Man and The Avengers. Stan made cameo appearances in many of the Marvel movies. Lee had a rocky relationship with Marvel once the company went full-tilt Hollywood. He sued the company in 2002 for royalties he said he was owed for the first \\"Spider-Man\\" movie. Three years later he settled the case for 10 million. \\"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse\\" is the latest installment of the film's franchise and will be released next month.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.\\"? The answer to this question is:","response":"What is the problem of induction, as presented by Hume, and how does it impact our certainty about future events, such as the sun rising in the East? Answer: The problem of induction, as presented by Hume, is that inductive reasoning requires inductive reasoning to establish its premises, leading to a circular argument for its justification. This issue impacts our certainty about future events, such as the sun rising in the East, because it means we cannot know with certainty that the future will resemble the past.

The word \\"laidun\\" refers to an area of land covered with grass, herbs, or other vegetative growth that is used for grazing animals, such as cows, sheep, or horses. In Finnish, the term \\"laidun\\" implies a similar meaning, emphasizing the practical usage of the land for feeding livestock. Finnish, a Uralic language, is the official language of Finland and also spoken by ethnic Finns in other parts of the world, like Sweden, Russia, and Norway. In Finland, it is common for people to engage in agriculture and animal husbandry, where the concept of pastures – or \\"laidun\\" – is crucial. In the Finnish countryside, you might come across diverse types of pastures, such as: 1. Niittylaidun: A meadow pasture that has been mowed for hay. 2. Metsälaidun: A forest or woodland pasture, where animals graze on a mixture of grass, leaves, and twigs. 3. Perinnelaidun: A traditional, typically unfertilized pasture that has been in use for generations. The use and management of pastures or \\"laidun\\" in Finland are vital to ensure sustainable livestock farming, maintain biodiversity, and preserve the cultural landscape that has been shaped over centuries. As a result, Finnish people put great effort into maintaining and preserving these lands for livestock, fostering traditional practices, and further incorporating sustainable and responsible agricultural methods."},{"question":"I can use this background: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer.

The decree - adopted in 2015 - requires those people to pay about 250 (Â£205) as compensation for lost tax revenues. It triggered mass protests last month, and more rallies are planned for March. Mr Lukashenko announced the decision to freeze the tax collection at a government meeting in the capital Minsk on Thursday. \\"The decree must be adjusted during March. The decree will not be abolished,\\" he was quoted as saying by Belarus's Belta news agency. The president also said that those who had already paid the tax in 2016 would be fully compensated if they found a job next year. According to the last tax inspection, 470,000 people should have paid the tax but only 50,000 had done so, Reuters news agency reports. At the same time, the president warned that the authorities must show \\"tough reaction\\" to organisers of any future street protests against the decree. Mr Lukashenko has run Belarus - a country where little dissent is tolerated - since 1994. He has been described by some Western officials as \\"Europe's last dictator\\".

It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

The muffin was less delicious than the cake, because the Pick from: (I). muffin was made by a professional baker.. (II). cake was made by a professional baker..","response":"II. cake was made by a professional baker. Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between rolling hills, there was a little bakery owned by a professional baker named Beatrice. Beatrice was well known for her delicious, mouth-watering cakes that would entice people from all around the town. Every day, from the crack of dawn, the pleasant aroma of freshly baked goods wafted throughout the town, beckoning the townspeople to visit her bakery and indulge in her delightful creations. On one particular sunny day, Sarah, an amateur baker, was inspired to create her own masterpiece: a muffin that could rival Beatrice's heavenly cakes. She poured her heart and soul into her creation for anyone who passed her house would stop and admire the smell of the freshly baked muffins and that they might taste equally amazing. Sarah spent hours in the kitchen, mixing and concocting her very own recipe. Finally, the day came when she felt confident enough to present her masterpiece muffin to the townsfolk. Word quickly spread that there was a new baker in town, and Beatrice, though skeptical, was excited to discover who her potential rival might be. As the townspeople gathered around Sarah's homemade bakery stand, they eagerly exchanged coins for a taste of her muffin. Expectations were high, and everyone excitedly took their first bite, eagerly seeking a flavor that could potentially rival that of Beatrice's remarkable cakes. To their disappointment, however, the muffin was underwhelming. While the townspeople noticed its appealing aroma, the taste just did not compare to the divine sweetness of Beatrice's cakes. The muffin was dry, the texture was lacking, and the flavors just did not manage to create the same symphony that every one of Beatrice's creations did. Even though it was not terrible, it definitely lacked the finesse and experience of a professional baker's touch. As Beatrice approached Sarah's makeshift bakery stand, she took a bite of the famed muffin herself. She paused for a moment, her eyes reflecting both sympathy and wisdom. Instead of dismissing her competition, she praised Sarah for her effort and creativity, much to Sarah's surprise. \\"I can see the potential in you, and I admire your determination to create something memorable,\\" Beatrice told Sarah, smiling warmly. \\"However, it takes years of practice and experience to create cakes that truly make an impact on people's taste buds.\\" Beatrice then extended an invitation to Sarah to become her apprentice, offering to share her decades of knowledge and experience in the art of baking. Sarah, both humbled and grateful for the opportunity, eagerly accepted Beatrice's offer. Several years passed, and under Beatrice's tutelage, Sarah blossomed into an extraordinary baker herself. Their partnership soon resulted in the creation of a cake that surpassed even the initial allure of Beatrice's original recipes. It was a cake that combined the creativity and passion of Sarah with the refined skill and knowledge of Beatrice. And thus, the bakery's legacy continued to grow, reaffirming the notion that while muffins might sometimes fall short of expectation, a cake crafted by a professional baker would never disappoint."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable.

Is Dutch stands out in combining a small degree of Ingvaeonic characteristics (occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from 'west to east' over the continental West Germanic plane) with mostly Istvaeonic characteristics, of which some of them are also incorporated in German. a good answer to this question?","response":"Answer: Yes, the statement provided gives a decent basis for understanding the linguistic relationship between Dutch and other Germanic languages. However, it could be further developed to provide more insight. The language most closely related to the East Low Franconian dialect of Dutch can be identified as Limburgish, a regional language spoken mainly in the Belgian and Dutch provinces of Limburg and in some areas in Germany. Dutch, as a Germanic language, forms a part of the larger West Germanic language family and originates from its Low Franconian branch. As stated, it possesses Ingvaeonic features also found in English and Frisian. Furthermore, Dutch shares many Istvaeonic characteristics with other Continental West Germanic languages, especially German. Limburgish, also referred to as Limburgian or Limburgic, is considered to be a language that is part of the broader East Low Franconian branch. As such, the East Low Franconian dialect of Dutch shares many linguistic features with Limburgish. Both dialects exhibit a range of common phonological, grammatical, and lexical characteristics. However, despite these shared features, there are regional differences that set them apart, making them distinct language varieties within the East Low Franconian group. Some commonalities between the East Low Franconian dialect of Dutch and Limburgish include the use of a unique system of tonal accents, the preservation of more archaic Germanic features in phonology and grammar, and a substantial overlap in terms of vocabulary. In addition, the dialectal continuum across the regions where these varieties are spoken renders their mutual intelligibility feasible. It is essential to mention that languages and dialects often do not adhere strictly to political borders; hence, the classification of a dialect may depend on various factors such as geography, culture, politics, and mutual intelligibility. In the case of East Low Franconian dialect of Dutch, the closest linguistic relative is Limburgish due to shared linguistic features and their geographic proximity. In conclusion, the statement provided outlines the Ingvaeonic and Istvaeonic characteristics found in Dutch and how they contribute to its uniqueness within the West Germanic language family. To strengthen the answer, Limburgish could be identified as the language with the most in common with the East Low Franconian dialect of Dutch, and further analysis of their shared features could be elaborated on to provide a more comprehensive response."},{"question":"Q: Given a pair of words, generate the relation between them.

But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Where will Trump send the National Guard to protect the US from drug smuggling? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. the border of Canada and USA B. the border of Hawaii C. not enough information D. The border of US and Mexico A:","response":"D.

The current members of the group are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins. The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees. The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney. Their final performance, after over 7000 shows over the years, was on 23 December at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Also by 2012, The Wiggles performed to audiences whose parents attended their shows in their early years, and they were hiring performers who were part of their audience as young children. The Wiggles began airing a show on Sirius XM satellite radio in late 2012, featuring the original members and their replacements, and stories and games for young listeners. In December, the group auctioned their famous \\"Big Red Car\\" (called the \\"iconic Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet\\") for charity for almost A36,000 on the auction site eBay. The money was donated to the Melbourne-based charity SIDS and Kids.
