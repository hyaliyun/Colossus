It then jumped the curb and rushed through a grassy expanse before plunging down an embankment toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911. Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window. \\"I have a fear of water,\\" Kenny said now. \\"I almost drowned when I was nine.\\" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. \\"I couldn't just leave her,\\" he adds. The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt. \\"Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,\\" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl. That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. \\"I flipped into rescue mode,\\" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out. Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock. \\"Give her CPR!\\" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. \\"Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,\\" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, \\"Pump her chest!\\" \\"We tried three times,\\" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water. Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat. Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. \\"We couldn't believe she was all right,\\" said Pamela. \\"It's just amazing that these people came together,\\" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her \\"angels\\" via frequent phone calls. \\"They are really beautiful people,\\" she said. Answer the following questions: 1.

Translate to English","response":"The phrase \\"Sleduj a uč se\\" is in Czech and it translates to \\"Watch and learn\\" in English. This phrase is often used to suggest that the best way to learn something is by observing or watching how it is done. By watching others, you can visibly understand the process and techniques involved. The phrase emphasizes the significance of visual learning, and the context typically involves someone demonstrating a task or skill and encouraging others to learn through careful observation. This method is common in practical skills or trades such as cooking, sewing, carpentry, or even in various sports. \\"Watch and learn\\" can also be used in a metaphorical sense where one encourages another to observe certain behaviors, habits, strategies, or methods to gain a competitive edge. This could be applicable in situations dealing with leadership, decision making, strategic planning, or other workplace and lifestyle scenarios. Moreover, the phrase has been adopted into many professional contexts. In project management, for example, project managers might shadow experienced professionals to acquire necessary skills. In the technology sector, it could mean observing how an experienced developer does his/her coding work. In the world of arts, novice artists might say \\"watch and learn\\" to one another as they observe a seasoned artist create a masterpiece. In essence, \\"watch and learn\\" is a popular phrase for expressing the importance of gaining knowledge or a skill by paying attention to how others perform certain tasks. It's evidence that, sometimes, learning isn't purely about reading books or attending lectures, but also about immersive, observational experiences."},{"question":"What is the sentiment of the following movie (choose your answer from the options) review sentence? powerful documentary Choose from: A). negative; B). positive; The answer is:","response":"B). positive"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Choices: - displace - isolate - decompose - ionize A: Answer:","response":"A: Ionize A detailed explanation of the answer: Van de Graaff generators produce high voltages and lead to large electric fields, which arise due to the accumulation of charges on the surface of the large metallic sphere that is typically a part of the generator design. The main principle behind the Van de Graaff generator is the triboelectric effect, where the charges are transferred from one medium to another by friction. When we discuss the practical limits of Van de Graaff generators, we need to consider several factors, including the presence of insulating materials, system design issues, and the surrounding environment. One of the most important factors affecting the generator's output relates to the large electric field created by the charges on the sphere. This large electric field polarizes the surrounding materials. Polarization is a process where electric charges, such as positive and negative charges, get separated in an insulating material due to an external electric field being applied to it. If the electric field strength is increased further, these surrounding materials get more and more polarized. At a certain point, the electric field reaches a level where it can ionize the surrounding materials. Ionization refers to the process where an atom or a molecule loses or gains one or more electrons, giving it a positive or negative charge (i.e., turning it into an ion). The electric field is strong enough to overcome the binding force between atoms or molecules and their electrons. When the materials around the Van de Graaff generator start to ionize, it causes electrical breakdown or discharge, as the generated ions create a conducting path for electric current. This electrical discharge can be seen in the form of sparks or corona discharges appearing around the generator, leading to a loss of charge from the generator and reducing its performance. In summary, the practical limits of Van de Graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize the surrounding materials. This ionization leads to electrical discharge that causes the generator to lose charge, affecting its performance and limiting its potential."},{"question":"Add spaces: Onoursitewithbarbiebikegamesonlineyoucanfindthenewestbarbiebike.","response":"Here is the sentence with spaces added: On our site with barbie bike games online you can find the newest barbie bike.

Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \\"Car of the Future\\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer. Better than systems to minimize injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating and sleepiness.

A:","response":"To find out at which university Professor Lee Smolin popularized the theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT), I will follow four primary steps: Step 1: Identify Professor Lee Smolin's background Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has worked on various aspects of quantum gravity and cosmology. He is a prominent researcher in the field of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT). He is also a founding faculty member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Step 2: Understand Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) CDT is an approach to quantum gravity that combines elements of both LQG and simplicial quantum gravity (a discrete analogue of General Relativity). The key idea underpinning CDT is to break spacetime into discrete 'building blocks' called triangulations, which only join together in a causal and consistent way. This allows for a well-defined notion of time and causality, which can be beneficial in resolving several conceptual problems with other approaches to quantum gravity. Step 3: Examine Professor Smolin's major affiliations during the development of CDT Throughout his career, Smolin has been affiliated with various institutions, including Yale University, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. As I have noted earlier, he was a founding member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, where he has worked since its inception in 1999. It is important to determine where he was during the popularization of CDT. Step 4: Identify when and where CDT was popularized The theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulation gained popularity in the early 2000s. As Lee Smolin was a founding faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics since 1999, it is reasonable to assume that he contributed to the popularization of CDT at the Perimeter Institute. Based on the above steps, I can conclude that Professor Lee Smolin popularized the theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT) at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics."},{"question":"How does the sentence end? See options at the end The dress code included skirts but excluded jeans, since the Choose your answer from: [1]. skirts were deemed appropriate for the office.; [2]. jeans were deemed appropriate for the office.;","response":"The sentence ends with option [1]. \\"The dress code included skirts but excluded jeans, since the skirts were deemed appropriate for the office.\\" In many office environments, workplace attire is an essential aspect of maintaining a professional atmosphere. Dress codes might differ from one organization to another and even among various departments within the same organization. Companies establish dress codes to communicate expectations to employees and clients and ensure that their company presents a specific image and brand. In the sentence you provided, skirts are permitted within the dress code guidelines, while jeans are not. The reason for this distinction likely relates to the impression that each type of clothing presents. Skirts are often considered traditional office wear, while jeans are frequently seen as casual or informal attire. Skirts are viewed as appropriate for office environments because they give a polished and professional appearance. There is a wide range of skirts (such as A-line, pencil, or midi skirts) that work well within business dress codes. In an office setting, a skirt's length and material usually play a crucial role in determining its appropriateness as well. Typically, skirts should be no shorter than knee-length and made of a professional-looking material like wool, cotton, or polyester-blend fabric. On the other hand, jeans are often associated with casual outfits and relaxed environments. Depending on their style, jeans can appear too informal for certain professional settings, leading companies to exclude them from their dress code. While some organizations have evolved to adopt casual Fridays or even full-time relaxed dress codes that include jeans, many companies still uphold a more conservative appearance in the workplace. In conclusion, the sentence emphasizes that the dress code at this particular office allows skirts but not jeans, as skirts are seen as suitable attire for maintaining a professional atmosphere. The dress code intends to create a consistent and polished image for the company and its employees."},{"question":"Here is a premise: they're now criminals themselves yeah that's that's the crazy thing about it you're you're putting Here is a hypothesis: They have went against the law.

Sandberg had been with department since 1981 and an investigator for 20 years, Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said. Evans and hospital vice president Kurt Otto declined to say why Hammond was being treated at the hospital in St. Cloud, which is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Otto said the hospital had asked the sheriff's office to send deputies to monitor Hammond because of the \\"seriousness\\" of the domestic incident, which happened sometime earlier in the week. They would not say how long Hammond had been in the hospital except that it was more than a day. He said investigators had a lot of work ahead of them, including interviewing hospital staffers who were on duty at the time. Hammond had been convicted of felony crimes including escaping from custody in 1990, third-degree burglary in 1989 and terrorist threats in 1990, according to court records. All the convictions were for crimes committed in Aitkin County. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton condemned the deputy's death and offered condolences to his family. \\"I deplore the terrible, senseless murder of Deputy Sheriff Steven Sandberg,\\" Dayton said in a statement. A woman answering the phone at Sandberg's home said nobody from the family was ready to comment. Hammond's home does not have a listed phone number. ||||| A violent “whirlwind of events” in a St. Cloud Hospital room early Sunday morning left two men dead, including a 24-year veteran of the Aitkin County sheriff’s office. The man who shot him was tased by another sheriff’s deputy and died at the scene, authorities said. “A suspect being treated at St. Cloud Hospital shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy who had been monitoring the welfare of the suspect who was a subject of an investigation outside the St. Cloud tri-county area,” said Jill Oliveira, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The BCA said the incident was confined to the suspect’s hospital room, and no one else was injured. The deputy was identified as Steven M. Sandberg, 60, who had been with the Sheriff’s Office since 1991 and working as an investigator for the past 20 years. The suspect was Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said during a news conference in St. Cloud. Hammond, of rural Aitkin, was in the hospital for medical reasons following a domestic situation, Evans said. The deputy was identified as Investigator Steven Martin Sandberg, who was 60 years old and is survived by a wife and daughter. He had worked with the Aitkin County Sheriff's Office since 1991. Photo provided by family members to KSTP. Hammond was not in police custody, Evans said, but he was being monitored by law enforcement “at the request of St. Cloud Hospital.” He was not handcuffed, Evans added. A struggle ensued after the suspect got out of his bed, Evans said, and Hammond got hold of Sandberg’s gun and squeezed off several rounds. A deputy from the same Sheriff’s Office tased Hammond, and the suspect “became unresponsive,” Evans said. Life-saving efforts were begun in the emergency room, but Hammond died, the superintendent said. Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said the incident was a “whirlwind of events in [a] very tragic situation.” Sandberg leaves behind a wife and daughter, Turner said. A hearse carrying Sandberg’s body from St. Cloud to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office on Sunday afternoon was escorted by dozens of police vehicles in a motorcade along Interstate 94. Hammond’s criminal history includes felony convictions for burglary and fleeing custody, both cases from roughly 25 years ago. Law enforcement scanner conversation of the unfolding pre-dawn scene was captured by the MN Police Clips website. “We do have an officer down in South 527,” came the word from the hospital to dispatch. “We have deputy that is shot … the shooter is in handcuffs.” Dispatch described the shooter as “an inmate ... and the inmate is now in custody.” An officer on the scene said the “guy got gun away from deputy, shot deputy” and the suspect went into cardiac arrest. The weapon was recovered, the officer added. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Gov. Mark Dayton said, “I deplore this terrible, senseless murder. ...

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W.

Choices: - street - forest - tree - yard - park The rationale to choose \\"street\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","response":"A brave squirrel can be found in various locations, such as a street, forest, tree, yard, or park. However, the rationale to choose \\"street\\" as the answer might be based on several factors, such as the squirrel's adaptability, resourcefulness, and willingness to take risks. 1. Urban environment: The street implies an urban environment where the squirrel has adapted to living in close proximity to humans and their infrastructure. A brave squirrel that lives in the city must navigate through various obstacles, such as traffic, people, and domestic animals like dogs and cats. This requires a level of boldness and courage, as they must be vigilant and able to react quickly to protect themselves. 2. Resourcefulness: Squirrels found in the streets are resourceful in finding food and shelter. They often rely on discarded food from humans, such as leftovers in trash cans, and can sometimes be seen digging in dumpsters. Additionally, they may build their nests in small crevices on buildings and other man-made structures instead of trees. This level of adaptability and resourcefulness requires squirrels to be brave and willing to seek out new opportunities for survival. 3. Willingness to take risks: Living on the streets requires squirrels to be more daring in their actions. They often need to cross busy roads to forage for food and face the dangers of traffic and potential predators. This demonstrates a willingness to take risks and exposes the squirrel to potentially dangerous situations, requiring them to be assertive and brave in their decision-making. 4. Human interaction: Squirrels living on the streets encounter human presence more frequently than those residing in forests, trees, yards, or parks. As a result, they may become more trustful of humans and rely on them for food. This requires a level of bravery, as they are exposing themselves to a potential threat by interacting with humans and entering their territory. Therefore, based on these factors, a brave squirrel can be found on the streets, as it showcases adaptability, resourcefulness, risk-taking, and exposure to humans. This is not to say that squirrels living in forests, trees, yards, or parks are not brave – each environment presents its own unique set of challenges and opportunities for squirrels to demonstrate their courage. Nevertheless, the street environment tends to exhibit a higher level of risk and obstacles that require squirrels to be more daring and resilient in their daily lives."},{"question":"Sparks was born in Phoenix, Arizona, to Jodi (nee Wiedmann) Sparks and former professional football player Phillippi Sparks.

The US justice department confirms that such an action is considered a crime and this case sets a precedent for how similar cases are dealt with in the future. Introduction: Epilepsy and Social Media Misuse Epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. These people suffer from recurrent seizures that can be triggered by various factors such as stress, lack of sleep, or in some cases, exposure to flashing lights. In recent years, social media has opened up new avenues for abuse, and individuals with malicious intent have begun weaponizing other people’s medical conditions. The Case: Man Accused of Triggering Epileptic Seizure Recently, US law enforcement agencies arrested a man on the accusation of sending a flashing image to intentionally trigger an epileptic seizure in a writer. The arrest followed an in-depth investigation, and the US justice department confirmed that this act is a crime and constitutes a precedent for future cases. The victim, who suffers from epilepsy, claims that they had received the flashing image via a social media platform. This exposure triggered an epileptic seizure, causing significant distress and discomfort. The accused allegedly researched the victim’s medical history and used this information to craft the malicious attack deliberately. Legal Implications: Setting the Precedent This case highlights the intersection of technology, human rights, and criminal liability. It raises important questions about the responsibility of individuals who misuse technology and social media platforms to cause physical harm intentionally. The accused man’s arrest serves as a clear warning to others that using technology to intentionally harm or harass others, particularly those with medical conditions, is a seriously punishable offense. As the internet and digital technology become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to enforce legal boundaries and hold users accountable for misusing these tools. The US justice department, in this case, has demonstrated that deliberately triggering a medical condition – such as an epileptic seizure – is not a harmless prank, but instead, a criminal act. Legal experts believe that this case will likely set a precedent for dealing with similar instances in the future. It could also prompt more jurisdictions to address this issue and develop laws to protect vulnerable individuals from targeted attacks. Social Media Platforms' Responsibilities As we continue to rely on social media for communication, connection, and entertainment, platforms also need to take on greater responsibility for protecting users from such attacks. They must develop adequate reporting systems and review processes to identify and remove threatening or harmful content swiftly. Additionally, these platforms need to work closely with law enforcement agencies to track down and arrest individuals who commit crimes using their services. Public Awareness and Empathy This incident serves as a stark reminder that technology can be as harmful as it is helpful. It emphasizes the need for public awareness campaigns to promote empathy and understanding towards individuals with medical conditions that render them more vulnerable to such attacks. The general public should be educated about the harmful consequences of sharing flashing images or any content that could potentially cause physical distress, especially to those with medical conditions like epilepsy. While it may seem like a harmless action to some, it could be life-threatening for others. By creating a more empathetic and informed society, we can also foster a safer and more inclusive digital environment for everyone. Conclusion In summary, this case reminds us of the potentially harmful consequences of misusing technology. It highlights the need for robust legal frameworks to address issues arising from the intersection of technology and human rights. Moreover, it calls for the active participation of social media platforms and the public to create and maintain a secure and inclusive digital environment for all. As a result, this case should serve as a valuable lesson to be learned by digital users and an opportunity to cultivate empathy and awareness towards the vulnerabilities of fellow human beings."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

Hypothesis: Il trionfo dell'onore is a comic opera","response":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that Il trionfo dell'onore is a comic opera. Let's delve into the details supporting this hypothesis. Context information: 1. Composer: The opera is composed by Alessandro Scarlatti, a prominent Italian Baroque composer known for his operas and chamber cantatas. Although most of his works were serious operas, this particular piece is mentioned as a comic opera. 2. Libretto: While the name of the librettist is not mentioned in the context, it is evident that the libretto was created for the purpose of providing a storyline, characters and dialogues to the opera. The libretti for comic operas typically focus on light-hearted themes and characters, which is in line with the comedic nature of Il trionfo dell'onore. 3. Genre: The context explicitly states that Il trionfo dell'onore is an \\"operatic 'commedia',\\" which means it is part of the comic opera genre. Commedia or Commedia dell'arte is a form of theatre characterized by improvisation, masks, and exaggerated characters, originating in Italy. By referring to Il trionfo dell'onore as an operatic 'commedia,' the context suggests that it incorporates comedic elements from the commedia tradition in its music, plot, and characters. 4. Premiere performance: The context mentions that Il trionfo dell'onore was first performed at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples on 26 November 1718. The fact that such a prestigious theatre chose to stage this work suggests that the comic opera had a level of artistic merit and popularity that would appeal to audiences at the time. 5. Singularity: The mention of Il trionfo dell'onore as Scarlatti's \\"only known comic opera\\" additionally supports the hypothesis. This information indicates that among Scarlatti's vast repertoire, this particular opera stood out for its comedic nature, which sets it apart from his other compositions. Considering all these factors present in the context - the composer's reputation, the reference to an operatic 'commedia,' the premiere performance at a renowned theatre in Naples, and the singularity of the work within Scarlatti's oeuvre - we can confidently draw the hypothesis that Il trionfo dell'onore is a comic opera."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals - Acid rain in fog at higher elevations can strip foliage off trees. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"acid rain is absorbed into the earths soil with aluminum\\" happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Direct Effect: When acid rain is absorbed into the earth's soil along with aluminum, the leaching of aluminum from clay particles in the soil can be less severe. This means that there might be lower amounts of aluminum entering streams and lakes, reducing the overall damage to aquatic ecosystems due to acid rain. Indirect Effects: 1. Reduced aluminum leaching could help maintain minerals and nutrients in the soil. Since aluminum can interfere with the availability of certain essential nutrients, less aluminum could potentially translate to better nutrient retention in soil. This would help plants benefit more from available nutrients and possibly reduce some of the negative impacts of acid rain on plant life. 2. The perturbation might help maintain a more balanced pH in soil and water. Since acid rain is being absorbed alongside aluminum, the acidic content may be somewhat neutralized by the presence of aluminum, reducing the overall change in pH. This can help reduce the stress on plants and aquatic life caused by fluctuating pH levels. However, it is essential to note that this perturbation does not completely eliminate the negative effects of acid rain on the environment. Acid rain can still dissolve minerals and nutrients in the soil, strip foliage off trees (especially in fog at higher elevations), and cause damage to plant and animal life. Despite the perturbation's potential to reduce some damage, the overall problem of acid rain and its adverse consequences still needs to be addressed through measures like reduction in air pollution and better atmospheric monitoring."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Indicate if the following Polish tweet contains cyber-bullying content with 'Yes'; otherwise, respond with 'No'.

And I was wondering How would Sasha feel afterwards? A:","response":"As an AI, I don't have direct access to Sasha's personal feelings or emotions. However, we can make assumptions based on general human behaviors and emotions. Generally, a person's feelings after waiting for a long time can depend on various factors, including their personality, the context of the situation, and the outcome of their wait. Given that Sasha is described as a 'patient' person, it's likely that she was able to handle the wait without becoming overly stressed or upset. Patience generally indicates the ability to tolerate waiting, delay, or frustration without becoming agitated or upset. People who are patient are typically able to remain calm and composed. After waiting for an hour, Sasha may have felt: 1. **Relief:** If the wait led to a desired outcome or was worth the wait, she may have felt relief that the wait is finally over. 2. **Satisfaction:** Waiting patiently and finally getting what you waited for can bring a sense of satisfaction. 3. **Tired or Exhausted:** Waiting for a long time might be tiring, both mentally and physically. 4. **Frustrated or Annoyed:** Even the most patient people can feel frustrated or annoyed if the wait is longer than expected or seems unreasonable.

Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith.

It was his first publication outside magazines, and immediately won him a reputation as a significant poet. This narrative poem takes the form of a dialogue between the aged Irish hero Oisín and St. Patrick, the man traditionally responsible for converting Ireland to Christianity. Most of the poem is spoken by Oisin, relating his three-hundred year sojourn in the isles of Faerie. Oisin has not been a popular poem with critics influenced by modernism, who dislike its pre-Raphaelite character. However, Harold Bloom defended this poem in his book-length study of Yeats, and concludes that it deserves reconsideration. - The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland, in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, first opened its doors to the public on 27 December 1904.

The subjects' (presumably people) faces were becoming sober. 2. This change in expression happened by the time the protagonist reached the doorway. 3. The protagonist looked back when he reached the doorway. Let's now look at the hypothesis: \\"He looked back when he reached the door.\\" The hypothesis is essentially stating that when the protagonist reached the door, he looked back. The distinction between a doorway and a door may seem minor, but it's important to consider whether the premise discusses the protagonist reaching an open doorless frame (a doorway) or an actual physical closing mechanism (a door). In most cases, the terms \\"doorway\\" and \\"door\\" are used interchangeably, and people often use the words to mean the same general idea. Here, the point of interest is the protagonist looking back as he reaches a threshold. As such, our focus should be on whether the protagonist indeed looked back when he reached this threshold, irrespective of the specific terminology. Upon comparing the two statements, we see a correlation of events. In both cases, the protagonist looks back as he reaches a certain point. In the premise, the point of interest is the \\"doorway,\\" while in the hypothesis, it is the \\"door.\\" Since the terms are often used synonymously and the central idea of both statements is the protagonist looking back when he reaches this point, we can reasonably conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis.

Albert Einstein's theory of relativity suggests that time travel could theoretically be possible; however, it would require an enormous amount of energy and currently unattainable technology.

Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound.

On Tuesday, the same court clarified that this does not mean audience members must stand if the national anthem is played as part of a movie, newsreel, or documentary shown in a theater, the Hindu reports. A petitioner asked the court for the clarification. As the Indian Express notes, moviegoers had been at risk of being harassed if they did not stand when the anthem was played as part of the plot of a film. Article:","response":"Title: Indian Supreme Court Clarifies National Anthem Rule in Cinemas Last year, a controversial mandate was issued by India's Supreme Court requiring movie theaters around the country to play the national anthem before each film screening. Not only that, but the audience members were also instructed to stand in respect while the national anthem was being played. However, on Tuesday, this seemingly stringent rule got a layer of clarification in a response to a petition filed by a concerned citizen. According to the Hindu newspaper, the same apex judicial institution issued a statement delineating the context of the mandate. The court clarified that, contrary to initial interpretations, the audience is not required to stand if the national anthem is integrated as part of a movie, newsreel, or documentary being shown in the theater. This clarification was prompted by a petition from an individual who sought legal settlement over the potential public fallout from this mandate. The petitioner was concerned about instances where the national anthem might be used within the plot or narrative of a film, where the requirement to stand could cause confusion or disruption among moviegoers. As noted by the Indian Express, prior to this clarification, there had been concerns over harassment of audience members who did not rise when the national anthem was played within the context of a film. Some moviegoers were anxious that failing to stand, they might face undue ridicule, confrontation or accusations of being unpatriotic even when the anthem was part of a film's plot. This confusion arose due to the ambiguity in the original court ruling, which was not clear whether the requirement to stand extended to instances of the anthem being played within a film or documentary. The ambiguity had inadvertently put movie lovers in a state of unease, with some fearing possible confrontations or even legal repercussions if they unknowingly violated the mandate. In India, respect for the national anthem is seen as a significant part of displaying patriotism. The initial court ruling was part of an effort to instill a deep sense of national pride and unity among citizens. While the motive was noble, it drew a divisive line among segments of society that conflicted with the liberal dynamics of creative freedom in the entertainment industry. The recent clarification by the Supreme Court comes as a relief to many, clearing worries of potential misunderstandings or altercations. Nevertheless, it shines light on the ongoing attempts to balance respect for national symbols and patriotic sentiment alongside individual rights and freedom of expression. This incident serves as a compelling reminder of the complexities of democracy in one of the world's largest and most diverse nations. In conclusion, the Indian Supreme Court's decision to clarify the national anthem mandate underscores its commitment to address the concerns of citizens, affirming the dynamic interpretation of law in the realm of entertainment and public spaces. It celebrates the rich tapestry of democratic dialogue, respecting and recognising the evolving perspectives of the nation's citizens. Reiterative of the fact that, while standing for the national anthem is a mark of respect and patriotism, the judiciary ensures it is not appropriated wrongly within the context of entertainment."},{"question":"Question: What key details about walter pagel can be extracted from the following bio?

Keep a log of specific actions, tasks, or times of days that trigger your blues. Write down exactly what you feel, what time it is, and why you think you feel that way. After a few weeks, look for patterns in your log to see what is causing your blues. If your Sunday blues come from leaving unpleasant tasks for the week ahead until Sunday night to complete, then you can help yourself feel better by changing your weekend and work routine. If your Sunday blues stem from anxiety about an upcoming presentation or assignment due on Monday, allow yourself to acknowledge your nervousness as normal, and then tell yourself that Monday will go well. Set aside prep time that weekend to make sure you are prepared. If your Sunday blues stem from your job, and none of the steps you take to address them work, then it may be time to look for new employment. Schedule a little time on Sunday's to update your resume and search for work. Taking positive steps forward will help you cope with returning to your job the next day. If you think of Friday as the end of the week, you'll be anxious about what you haven't gotten done. Similarly, if you think of Sunday as the end of the weekend, you'll worry that you haven't maximized your time. But these days aren't ends. They are a part of an unending procession of days and nights, each one a part of a larger process. If you don't finish what you hoped to on Sunday, that's fine. You have the next week to do it. So instead of creating artificial units of time, separate from the rest of life, during which certain tasks have to be accomplished, try to weave those tasks into the overall fabric of your life. If Sunday evening is approaching and you still have tasks to accomplish, don't try to cram them in that night. Instead, make a to-do list of how you will accomplish them during the week to come. Space out fun activities. Trying to cram all your fun into the weekend can be more stressful than enjoyable. Be sure to space out fun activities over the course of the week. That way you won't be disappointed if your weekend isn't as fantastic as you hoped. If after adjusting your weekend routine, organizing your Fridays, and trying to make Monday a fun day, you still suffer from the Sunday Night Blues, it is time to get professional guidance to help you explore the deeper causes of your negative feelings. They might stem from experiences earlier in your life, such as fearing school on Mondays because you were bullied or had a learning disorder. Or they might reflect unease with the type of work you do.

Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. and a hint : Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" Please answer this question : Which continent caused less tropical forest destruction?

The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.

Here are the steps to solving it: Step 1: Firstly, it's best to isolate the term with z (which is 9*z) on one side of the equation by moving the constant term (-25 in this case) to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 25 to both sides of the equation. The equation becomes: 2 + 25 = 9*z - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 27 = 9*z Step 2: Next, you want to solve for z. To do that, you need to get rid of the 9 that is currently being multiplied by the z. You can do this by doing the opposite operation - in this case, that's division. Divide both sides of the equation by 9: 27 / 9 = (9*z) / 9 This simplifies to: 3 = z So, the solution to the equation 2 = 9*z - 25 for z is z = 3. This means that if you substitute 3 back into the equation in place of z, the left-hand side should equal the right-hand side, thereby satisfying the equation."},{"question":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: High school sophomore Samantha \\"Sam\\" Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day on her 16th birthday, which her entire family has forgotten about because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day.

The volume caused pages to load slowly and the rate of errors to spike. About 10 a.m. EST, federal officials turned on a new queuing system that alerts some visitors to the site to come back later. PHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare The new problems came just a day after the administration announced that it had hit its goal of rescuing HealthCare.gov from its disastrous launch two months ago. Officials said over the weekend that improvements to the site would allow 50,000 people to use it simultaneously. But Bataille acknowledged that her agency was forced to start queuing visitors when about 35,000 visitors were on the site Monday morning. “We will continue to work to make improvements and upgrades,” she said. [Updated, 6:48 p.m. Dec. 2: The administration said performance of the site improved later in the day, saying in a Twitter message that 750,000 people had used the site by 5:30 p.m. and that users were no longer having to wait in the queue.] The website is supposed to allow consumers in 36 states who do not get health coverage through work to shop for a health plan. The plans must meet new standards outlined in the Affordable Care Act. The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia are using their own insurance marketplaces and websites for residents. In most cases, those have functioned significantly better than HealthCare.gov. Other issues with the site continue to concern insurance companies, which have been getting inaccurate or incomplete data about consumers who have tried to enroll in health plans through HealthCare.gov. PHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments Bataille said Monday that officials believe they have fixed one of the main software bugs responsible for errors in the transmission of this data. But she refused to provide information about the extent of the problem and what percentage of consumer data is now is being accurately sent, a critical measure of the site’s effectiveness. Bataille urged consumers who believe they have successfully enrolled in a health plan through the website to double check with their insurance carriers. Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook noam.levey@latimes.com Twitter: @noamlevey ||||| The Healthcare.gov website is displayed on laptop computers arranged for a photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2013. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Ihab Issa lost track of how often he has tried to buy insurance through HealthCare.gov, although he knows it is probably more than 100 times. Issa, 48, who works in a psycho­therapy office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., started logging in to the Web site when it launched Oct. 1. Since then, he has visited the site once or twice a day, only to encounter a different obstacle. But on Sunday — after 61 days of trying — the system worked. “I was thrilled,” Issa said. “I had to be at work, but I just wanted to sit there and look at all the different options.” The White House announced early Sunday that, given the recent improvements in the site, most HealthCare.gov shoppers should be able to have an experience like Issa’s. By 10 a.m., however, the Web site seemed to be struggling with high traffic. Federal health officials said they saw an increase in error rates and a slowdown in response times and decided to deploy “queueing” software designed to limit the number of users permitted on the site at one time. The number of users at that point had reached the “mid-30,000” range, said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing HealthCare.gov. That figure is substantially below the 50,000 simultaneous users that officials said the site would be able to handle as of Sunday. Asked whether Monday’s traffic indicated that the site’s true capacity was below 50,000, Bataille did not answer directly. She referred instead to a separate metric the administration has used to measure success — that 800,000 people would be able to use the Web site in the course of a single day. From midnight to noon Monday, HealthCare.gov had 375,000 visitors, and Bataille said the site was on pace to exceed the 800,000 figure by the end of the day. At 5:30 p.m., the Web site reported 750,000 visitors; shoppers no longer had to wait in line and error rates were low, according to a HealthCare.gov tweet. With twice as much traffic as the site sees on a typical Monday, error rates and page wait times were higher than normal, Bataille said. The average page took two seconds to load, four times the administration’s target of half a second or less. Web pages had an error rate of 0.9 percent; the target error rate is 1 percent or lower. Those who had to wait earlier in the day received a message saying the wait was necessary “so we can make sure there’s room for you to have a good experience on our site.” Shoppers had the option to leave their e-mail addresses and be notified when the site was available. When they returned, they were supposed to be moved to the front of the queue. Kathy Coombs, 61, of Alexandria was able to log on to the site Oct. 1. She created an account and received an e-mail saying her results had been processed. “I was so excited about it,” said Coombs, who is likely to receive a government subsidy to help her pay for her insurance. “I’m a huge liberal and big proponent of all this, and as a recent widow I could really benefit.” But since then, she has been unable to see her choices of health plans. At 1:30 p.m. Monday, she tried again, but she ran into heavy traffic and was unable to proceed. “I still hit a dead end,” she said. Others had more success shopping for insurance over the weekend, when traffic was lighter. Tom Marchetti, a 41-year-old pizzeria owner from Freeland, Pa., enrolled in coverage Sunday after weeks of failed attempts. When he logged on Sunday, he noticed a new button that allowed him to delete his pending application. He breezed through a new application in less than an hour, purchasing a policy that he said is comparable in price and coverage to the plan he has in the individual market. Still, Marchetti is not totally sure he is in the clear. While the Web site listed his maximum annual out-of-pocket costs as 175, the insurance company says that the number is 3,500. It is possible that Marchetti may qualify for subsidy to reduce those costs, but he needs to reach his new insurance provider to figure out the discrepancy. Others, though, were just as stuck Monday as they were in the past. One persistent issue appears to involve identity verification, in which HealthCare.gov tries to make sure people are who they say they are. Kelly Weaver, a substitute teacher in Michigan, said her application has been stuck in the identity verification process since mid-October. “I don’t know what they’re fixing,” Weaver said Monday. She said she considers herself a health-law supporter. She tried logging in on Sunday, but her identity had not been verified. Weaver has submitted identity verification information online and over the phone. She has uploaded copies of her driver’s license to the Web site. When she has called the customer service center, she has twice been told that she would receive a call back in two to five business days.

White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama planned to buy coverage through the exchange, even though he was not required to by law. Carney did not say when the registration will happen. The president has the option of choosing to enroll through the District of Columbia’s exchange or the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, which is handling sign-ups for his home state of Illinois. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE The federal government may say it has improved HealthCare.gov but insurers say they are not so sure. And customers signing up for health insurance need to make sure they really are covered. The key? Look for the orange pop-up notice. Lots of people may be in that position. A senior administration official told NBC News that 750,000 people had visited the site as of 5.30 p.m. Eastern time Monday. Visits don't equal enrollments, but it's a far higher number of visitors than the site's been forced to handle since the first few days of its disastrous launch. The so-called back end — where the actual business of paying for and getting enrolled in insurance takes place, isn’t working perfectly. Officials say they’re aware of it, and reminding people to make sure they are, in fact, fully enrolled. “When a consumer selects a plan and enrolls in marketplace coverage, an orange message is clearly displayed letting them know that they must make payment to be covered,” said a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is running the website. “If a consumer doesn’t receive that notice or is unsure as to whether they successfully enrolled, they should contact our call center or the insurer of their choice. The consumer will then be contacted by their insurer on how and when to make payment.” CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said the agency will try to confirm that those who have enrolled know their next steps to ensure they are covered. Robert Zirkelbach of America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, says forms called “834s” are still glitchy. They are a kind of digital enrollment form that conveys crucial information about new customers to the insurance company. “Health insurers are still seeing enrollments that are duplicated, missing information, things like that,\\" Zirkelbach said. CMS officials say they’re working on it. \\"We have fixed many of the bugs that led to the 834 issues,\\" Bataille said Tuesday. She said a single bug involving social security numbers caused 80 percent of the problems, and had been fixed. This past weekend was the government’s self-imposed deadline for fixing the faulty HealthCare.gov website. Jeff Zients, the incoming White House economic adviser named by President Barack Obama to lead repair efforts, gave his team’s efforts a glowing review on Sunday. “After clearing through fewer than 100 bugs across the entire month of October, the speed has more than tripled, with over 400 bugs fixed,” Zients told reporters in a telephone briefing. He said HealthCare.gov was now working more than 90 percent of the time and up to the promised capacity of 50,000 users at any given time. Bataille said traffic slowed the site down Monday morning, with error rates going up and response time going down. When about 30,000 users were on the site at one time Monday morning, the technology team deployed a new queuing system that tells users the site is too busy and offering to send them an email when traffic eases, Bataille said. That's fewer users than the promised 50,000 at once but Bataille declined to say so directly. Separately, a person familiar with the numbers who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss them said an estimated 100,000 people had been able to choose a health plan using the federally run site in November. That compares to around 27,000 in October, and far fewer than what officials had hoped for. New York reported on Monday that 91,103 New Yorkers have managed to fully enroll on that state's site. \\"Of these enrollees, 50,119 have enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan and 40,984 have qualified for Medicaid,\\" the state health department said in a statement. The White House will officially report the November enrollments in mid-December. Officials say the numbers must be “scrubbed” to make sure they are accurate. In the meantime, the best way to tell how things are going will be in anecdotes, says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “We will see if people are being helped,” he said. It was the litany of first-person stories that fueled the heavy news media coverage about people losing their private plans, Levitt said. On top of having their plans canceled, their best hope for finding alternative care was the balky website. “It was so hard for people to find out what their options are,” he said. Obama relented and said the federal government would allow private insurers to continue issuing plans in 2014 even if they didn’t meet the new, strict requirements for coverage — although it’s been left to the states to decide whether they really can. The White House and CMS were preparing, and hoping, for a rush of enrollees in December. Experts say experience shows that Americans tend to wait until the last minute to sign up for health insurance. Plus, the Obama administration slid the open enrollment period back a little, giving people until Dec. 23 to sign up for coverage that would start on the first day possible, Jan. 1. People have until March 31 to sign up for coverage and get credit for being covered in 2014. Anyone going without medical insurance in 2014 may have to pay a tax. More than 40 million Americans lack health insurance and one of the primary goals of the 2010 Affordable Care Act was to get them covered — either by buying tightly regulated, private insurance on the exchanges, or by getting expanded Medicaid in the states that choose to expand it, or through an employer under new requirements for covering workers. CMS officials say the website’s repair is an ongoing process. Zients leaves for his job at the White House in January and White House spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said he will be replaced, but didn’t say whether there is a candidate. · Follow NBCNewsHealth on Facebook and on Twitter · Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter ||||| Wait, what?

We look at some websites that outperformed it over Black Friday weekend. (The Washington Post) HealthCare.gov was available for 95.1% of users in the week ending November 30. We look at some websites that outperformed it over Black Friday weekend. (The Washington Post) The enrollment records for a significant portion of the Americans who have chosen health plans through the online federal insurance marketplace contain errors — generated by the computer system — that mean they might not get the coverage they’re expecting next month. The errors cumulatively have affected roughly one-third of the people who have signed up for health plans since Oct. 1, according to two government and health-care industry officials. The White House disputed the figure but declined to provide its own. The mistakes include failure to notify insurers about new customers, duplicate enrollments or cancellation notices for the same person, incorrect information about family members, and mistakes involving federal subsidies. The errors have been accumulating since HealthCare.gov opened two months ago, even as the Obama administration has been working to make it easier for consumers to sign up for coverage, the government and industry officials said. Figuring out how to clean up the backlog of errors and prevent similar ones in the future is emerging as the new imperative if the federal insurance exchange is to work as intended. The problems were the subject of a meeting Monday between administration officials and a new “Payer Exchange Performance Team” made up of insurance industry leaders. The idea that one-third of the enrollment records are flawed “doesn’t accurately reflect the picture of what’s happening right now,” White House senior communications adviser Tara Mc­Guinness said. “We’ve got a team of experts already working closely with issuers to make sure that every past and future 834 is accurate. We’re confident they’ll succeed,” Mc­Guin­ness said. The 834s are nightly enrollment forms sent to insurers to tell them who their new customers are. Some of the errors in the past forms were generated by the way people were using the system, another senior official on the project said, such as clicking twice on the confirmation button or moving backward and forward on the site. Through more than a dozen bug fixes over the past week, the team has managed to reduce the instances of when data was not generated on 834 forms from 3 percent last week to 0.5 percent now, according to senior officials. The heightened attention to enrollment errors follows a five-week technical blitz to improve consumers’ ability to use the site. Federal health officials announced Sunday that they had met that goal. By 6 p.m. Monday, the Web site had had close to 800,000 unique visitors — one of the administration’s targets for the site’s performance — and was set to pass that mark by the end of the day, according to administration officials. And the site processed 18,000 enrollments in the most recent 24-hour period, nearly double the previous record. Still, not all was smooth. By mid-morning Monday, some Americans trying to use the Web site were running into a logjam. And by late morning, when the number of people on the site was roughly 35,000 — or 15,000 fewer than administration officials had said it could handle — some consumers encountered a “queue,” a new feature intended for times when the site was too crowded. The feature limits the number of people on the site and notifies others by e-mail when it’s a better time to log in. According to a government official with knowledge of the federal exchange, an internal report Monday showed that nearly 149,000 individuals have completed the enrollment process through the new online system. Insurers have been fretting about the problems involving the enrollment records for weeks, both publicly and in private conversations with the White House. The figures provided to The Washington Post suggesting that a variety of errors affect at least one-third of all enrollments so far are the first public indication of the magnitude of the problem. The errors, if not corrected, mean that tens of thousands of consumers are at risk of not having coverage when the insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, because the health plans they picked do not yet have accurate information needed to send them a bill. Under the 2010 law designed to reshape the health-care system, consumers are not considered to have coverage unless they have paid at least the first monthly insurance premium. Of the various errors generated by the online system, a top priority for insurers is to correct what are called “orphan reports,” in which a new customer is inexplicably excluded from reports sent to each health plan early every evening listing their new enrollees from that day. Starting in October, five insurance carriers began to work closely with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff, periodically trading their lists of known customers. “When plans have checked this, they realize there is a good number there is no record of,” said an insurance industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the problem. Last week, the official said, the online system sent one health plan a cancellation notice for a customer for whom the plan had never received an enrollment report. The trading of enrollment records between a small number of insurers and CMS, which is overseeing the Web site, is a precursor to a monthly comparison that is scheduled to begin in mid-December. The part of the online system that is supposed to perform this comparison, known as “reconciliation,” is not yet built, according to government officials. On Monday, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for CMS, recommended that insurance seekers who choose a health plan through the site contact the insurer afterward to make certain they are actually enrolled. “Consumers should absolutely call their selected plan and confirm that they have paid their first month’s premium, and coverage will be available January 1,” she said. In a call with reporters Monday, Bataille said that about 80 percent of the errors with 834 forms — the enrollment data — stemmed from “one bug that prevented a Social Security number from being included. That caused the system not to generate an 834.” “That bug has now been fixed and [that part] is now working properly,” Bataille said. She said that CMS also has addressed smaller bugs, including one that caused family relationships to be coded inaccurately (a child, for example, might show up as a spouse). Sarah Kliff contributed to this report. |||||","response":"In December 2013, the relaunch of the Obama administration's healthcare website, HealthCare.gov, faced a significant surge in consumer demand, causing an increase in errors and forcing the administration to put thousands of users on hold. According to Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there were about 375,000 visitors to the site before noon on the day of the relaunch, double the typical traffic for a Monday morning. This caused pages to load slowly and error rates to rise. The issues faced by the relaunched website presented difficulties for users attempting to access coverage in the 36 states where the marketplace operates. In an update, the administration reported that later in the day, the site's performance improved, with 750,000 people accessing the site by 5:30pm and users no longer having to wait in queues. Other issues, such as incorrect or incomplete data from consumers attempting to enroll, continued to cause concern for insurance companies using the site, as fixing these issues was seen as necessary for the effective functioning of the federal insurance exchange."},{"question":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Context: Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship. Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team's 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team's 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto's 23-0 victory to claim the national title. Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen's University, 12-11. In that game, Conacher was the entire Argonaut offense rushing 35 times for 227 yards but Pep Leadley's 21 yard field goal towards the end of the game gave Queens' its victory. Question: How did his team do?. Whats the answer?","response":"Lionel Conacher's teams performed quite well throughout his football career. In his early years, he played with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League, winning city championships in each of the four seasons between 1912 and 1915. In 1918, he won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA. When he moved up to the intermediate level in 1919 with the intermediate Capitals, his team reached the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final but lost to their opponents from Sarnia. In 1920, Conacher joined the Toronto Rugby Club at the senior level, where his team won the ORFU championship. However, they lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His impressive play led to him being signed by the Argonauts for the 1921 season. That year, the team went undefeated in six games, with Conacher leading the IRFU in scoring. The Argonauts won the eastern championship and faced the Edmonton Eskimos in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher played a crucial role in securing Toronto's 23-0 victory and the national title. In 1922, Conacher was named captain and led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, with five wins and one tie. However, the Argonauts lost the Eastern final to Queen's University, with a final score of 12-11. Although Conacher had an outstanding individual performance in that game, his team could not secure the victory. Overall, Lionel Conacher had an illustrious career in football, with numerous team accomplishments and personal successes. His teams won various city and provincial championships, along with the Grey Cup in 1921. Despite facing a few losses, Conacher's impact on his teams' performance is evident in their achievements during his career."},{"question":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Answer:","response":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons why this review might negatively impact my decision to purchase the product. Firstly, the review title claims that the movie is \\"More than unrealistic!\\" which implies that the movie's plot and scenarios are highly impractical or improbable. As a potential customer, I might be looking for a movie that has a more believable and well-grounded storyline, so this description is off-putting. Secondly, the reviewer states that the film feels like \\"a creation of a Rambo fan.\\" This suggests that the movie may be too heavily influenced by or trying to mimic popular action movies like Rambo, rather than offering something new and innovative. This comparison could be a red flag for someone seeking a unique and engaging film experience. Additionally, the review mentions that unrealistic elements include \\"thirty untrained Jews killing with their bare hands hundreds of German SS soldiers\\". This portrayal might not only be implausible but also potentially offensive or insensitive to some viewers, as it may trivialize the experiences of Holocaust survivors and victims. Furthermore, the reviewer seems to be unhappy with the film's casting choices, specifically mentioning Hank Azaria and David Schwimmer. The reviewer humorously refers to these actors as the \\"Terminator and James Bond,\\" which implies that they might not be well-suited to the roles they have been cast in. If I value the credibility of the acting performances in movies, this criticism would further decrease my interest in the film. Lastly, the overall negative tone of the review suggests that the reviewer likely did not enjoy the film and therefore does not recommend it. While individual opinions may vary, the dissatisfaction expressed in the review contributes to an overall negative perception of the movie. In conclusion, the review presented would likely decrease the chances of me buying the movie due to its criticisms about the film's unrealistic plot, potential insensitivity, casting choices, and lack of originality.

Step 5: Discuss the performances While Cruiseman and Rennerie have garnered accolades for their previous performances, they fail to work their magic in \\"Perilous Paths.\\" Their characters are left floundering as the script holds them back, and they deliver mechanical and uninspired renditions that leave viewers wondering why these talented actors agreed to the project at all. Step 6: Talk about the direction Jack Mails also falters in his directorial approach, often forcing awkward interactions and predictable plot twists that leave the audience uninterested. The cliched tropes and one-dimensional characters are a visual eye-roll, demonstrating a lack of creative vision. Step 7: Mention technical aspects Furthermore, the film is plagued by jarring editing choices and dizzying camera angles that detract from the viewing experience. The musical score offers little solace, only serving to amplify the sense of disarray. Step 8: Conclude the review In conclusion, \\"Perilous Paths\\" is a disjointed and forgettable affair that could have been so much more. With its intriguing premise and talented cast, it is a bitter pill to swallow that the film never achieves the sense of thrills and intrigue it sets out to gratify. I would recommend passing on this one and saving your time and money for a more engaging release."},{"question":"The militant Iraqi group which last week released two Italian hostages is bartering with the terrorists holding British hostage Ken Bigley in order to release him for a ransom.

But surely any fan of Sellers will find delight in all of his films, simply because of the man's huge talent. and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers last film, (it was even released after his death), but it's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise. And not only do we get one Sellers, but we get to, for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu. The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his age-defying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him. Just like any of Sellers greater films, the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him, as well as many of his familiar-faced co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoying a cameo with Sellers - albeit playing the same role, but still nice. The story is indeed pretty ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence. And, although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially on it's initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers' death (the film was released less than 3 weeks after)and there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film. It's far from a great film - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes simply aren't there - but it is nevertheless enjoyable - if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","response":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed-positive. The reviewer acknowledges some shortcomings of the film, such as it being slow, too ridiculous, and the jokes not always landing. However, they also express appreciation for Peter Sellers' talent and the performances of familiar co-stars, finding enjoyment in the film despite its flaws. They recognize that it may not live up to the expectations of some Peter Sellers fans but argue that it is still worth watching for the actor's irreplaceable talent. The sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive but leans more towards the positive side due to the appreciation for Sellers' performance."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This plot is for the original Canadian version of the film.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","response":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" To explain further, the given process outlines the life cycle of a bird. The scenario suggests that more baby birds will grow into adults, which means there will be an increase in the number of birds. This increase will have an effect on the overall bird population, leading to an indirect impact on at least one step of the process. For example, the larger number of adult birds may lead to increased competition for resources, such as food and nesting sites. This competition could potentially make it more challenging for some birds to find a mate, build a nest, or even lay eggs in a safe environment. Consequently, a higher number of birds may not be able to successfully complete the entire life cycle, indirectly causing some steps of the process to be less effective for certain individuals.

Yes or no? Answer: Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . Question: what type of spider has the most eyes The answer is:","response":"The type of spider with the most eyes belongs to the family Deinopidae, more commonly known as Ogre-faced or Net-casting spiders. These spiders possess a unique arrangement of eyes, which includes a total of eight eyes, with two strikingly large principal eyes and three smaller pairs of secondary eyes. Ogre-faced spiders can be found in various habitats, such as the Americas, Africa, and Australia. They are nocturnal hunters and rely significantly on their exceptional vision to detect and capture prey. The large principal eyes, also known as anterior median eyes, are significant for this group of spiders due to their outstanding night vision capabilities. The secondary eyes and large principal eyes of the Ogre-faced spiders work together to provide them with a superb field of vision, making them highly efficient predators. The structure of the anterior median eyes is quite elaborate. Inside, a large number of photoreceptor cells and a highly reflective layer called the tapetum help in enhancing the spider's visual sensitivity in low-light conditions. The tapetum's function is to reflect the light back through the photoreceptors, allowing the spider to detect its prey even in the dark. The eyes can also be regenerated by a shedding process called molting if they get damaged. In addition to their unique eyes, the Net-casting spiders utilize an atypical hunting strategy. They create a small, rectangular silk net which they hold with their front legs. They then dangle from a silk thread and wait for a prey to approach. When an unsuspecting insect passes by, the spider stretches the net and captures it in a lightning-fast movement. In conclusion, the Deinopidae family, specifically the Ogre-faced or Net-casting spiders, possess the most eyes among all types of spiders. They have a total of eight eyes, with two large principal eyes and three pairs of smaller secondary eyes. This eye arrangement, coupled with their superior night vision abilities and unique hunting techniques, makes them fascinating creatures in the complex world of spiders."},{"question":"What most naturally follows? How to avoid harmful food additives Avoid foods with tartrazine or yellow 5. Tartrazine is commonly known as yellow 5 (which its commonly listed as on the ingredient list). It's a coloring that's added to many different types of foods and has been associated with some adverse reactions (especially in children).","response":"To avoid harmful food additives, like tartrazine or yellow 5, you can follow these steps: 1. Read the ingredient list on the food package: Look for the names of additives like tartrazine or yellow 5 to make sure they're not inside the food. Remember that they might be hidden under different names, so look for anything similar. 2. Choose natural and whole foods: Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods that don't have a long list of ingredients can help you avoid harmful additives. Think of foods that come from the ground or plants and animals, not from a factory with lots of machines. 3. Pick products with fewer and simpler ingredients: When buying packaged foods, try to pick ones with a short ingredient list. The fewer ingredients there are, the less likely the food will contain harmful additives. 4. Go for organic products: Organic foods are made without harmful chemicals and additives like tartrazine. Look for labels that say \\"Organic\\" on them. 5. Cook at home: When you make your own food, you can control what goes into it. That means you won't accidentally add harmful additives like yellow 5.

It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike?

According to this law , if an s - mobile is added to a root that starts with a voiced or aspirated stop , that stop is devoiced . Compare : PIE * bHg - > Latin fragor , but * s - bHg - > PIE * spHg - > Sanskrit sphrjati . - Theodor Siebs (26 August 1862 28 May 1941) was a German linguist most remembered today as the author of \\"Deutsche Bühnenaussprache\\" published in 1898. The work was largely responsible for setting the standard pronunciation of the modern German language and is referred to popularly by German speakers as \\"der Siebs\\". - German is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein; it is also an official, but not majority language of Luxembourg. Major languages which are most similar to German include other members of the West Germanic language branch, such as Afrikaans, Dutch, and English. It is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English. What is the relationship between 'siebs' law' and 'language'? Answer:","response":"'Siebs' law' has a significant relationship with language, specifically in context of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) phonological transformations, and the evolution of languages in general. Named after the German linguist Theodor Siebs, 'Siebs' law' is a phonological rule that helps linguists trace the transformation of sounds and the evolution of words from PIE to later languages. This rule, in its specifics, states that if an 's-mobile' (a prefix 's' that could be added or removed from a root in Proto-Indo-European) is attached to a root that commences with a voiced or aspirated stop consonant (like b, d, g in English), that consonant becomes 'devoiced'. In other words, the initial consonant sound of a word undergoes a change when prefixed with an 's-mobile'. This linguistic law helps linguists understand how certain words may have evolved and transformed over time due to these sound changes. For instance, the Latin word \\"fragor\\" derived from the PIE word \\"*bHg-\\" illustrates this linguistic shift. But when prefixed with an 's-mobile', \\"*s-bHg-\\" transforms into \\"*spHg-\\" in PIE, which finally gives the Sanskrit word \\"sphrjati\\". Broadly, linguistic laws like 'Siebs' law' are essential for establishing connections between different languages in the same family, for instance the Indo-European family. They allow linguists to reconstruct proto-languages (like PIE), understand language change and development, and create language families and trees. Through understanding such laws, linguists can also comprehend the linguistic variations among different geographies and periods. Theodor Siebs is also known for his significant contribution to the German language. His work \\"Deutsche Bühnenaussprache,\\" published in 1898, played a crucial role in setting the standard pronunciation for the modern German language. The work is often referred to by German speakers as \\"der Siebs\\". Therefore, putting it all together, the term 'Siebs' law' is deeply embedded in the field of linguistics and bears a strong connection to languages. It helps to trace their evolution and transformations, enhances our understanding of linguistics changes over a period of time, and contributes to the study of language relationships in the Indo-European family. Siebs' other contributions, particularly in the standardization of German pronunciation, further strengthen this relationship between 'Siebs' law' and 'language'. It ultimately underlines the role of individual linguistic rules and concepts in the broad spectrum of linguistic studies and language development."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

The original songs, written mostly by Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, and Lukas Nelson, range from the soaring, heartfelt ballad \\"Shallow\\" to the haunting, melancholy \\"I'll Never Love Again.\\" The soundtrack enhances the film by showcasing the protagonists' talent and propelling the narrative forward. Step 4: Cover any other notable aspects It is worth noting that the supporting cast, including Sam Elliott, Dave Chappelle, and Andrew Dice Clay, deliver strong, memorable performances that complement the leads. The film also explores themes like addiction, mental health, and the dark side of fame in a way that feels nuanced and authentic, sparking conversation and reflection. Step 5: Provide a conclusion that sums up the review Overall, \\"A Star is Born\\" is an emotionally charged film that showcases the brilliant acting of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, as well as the beautiful visuals and unforgettable soundtrack that support it. This film is not just a retelling of an old story, but a unique and powerful cinematic experience that will remain with viewers long after the credits roll."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: John suffered from mental illness, but he was in good hands.

The Kangxi Emperor was the fourth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, ruling from 1661-1722. Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, was occupied by the Qing army during his reign in 1720, which is the event inquired about in the question. The Kangxi Emperor's interest in Tibet began in the early 1700s, especially due to the strategic importance of the region and the ongoing influence of the Mongols, with whom the Qing Dynasty continually interacted. The Mongol Dzungars invaded Tibet in the aftermath of the death of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1682, and the political uncertainty that ensued. However, Dzungar occupation was quite brutal and Tibetans sought assistance from the neighboring Qing Dynasty. In 1717, the situation escalated, with the Dzungars overtaking Tibet and killing Lochen Desi, the King of Tibet. This prompted the Kangxi Emperor to intervene and send a Qing expedition in 1720, ultimately seizing control of Lhasa and expelling the Dzungars. The event marked the beginning of Qing's influence in the region, and consequently, the 7th Dalai Lama was reinstated to his position by the emperor. The statement provided, however, refers to the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, the sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who ruled from 1735-1796. The establishment of the permanent Qing garrison and protectorate occurred in 1751, long after the Kangxi Emperor's reign. The involvement of different emperors and the different historical events that happened during their reigns must be taken into consideration when answering the question properly. Hence, a better answer to the question \\"When did the Kangxi Emperor occupy Lhasa?\\" would be: The Kangxi Emperor occupied Lhasa in 1720, after sending a Qing expedition to expel the invading Mongol Dzungars and subsequently putting the Tibet region under Qing influence."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Jan changed their mind and called a cab. Given the question \\"How would Jan feel afterwards?\\", is \\"like they made the right choice\\" a valid answer? A:","response":"Yes, \\"like they made the right choice\\" is a valid answer to the question of how Jan would feel afterwards. When a person decides not to engage in risky behavior, such as driving under the influence (DUI), they are making a responsible decision that can have a positive impact on their wellbeing and that of others around them. Driving under the influence poses a considerable threat not only to the driver but also to pedestrians, passengers, and other drivers on the road. Penalties associated with getting caught driving under the influence are severe, including fines, license suspension, potential jail time, and an increased insurance premium. In this scenario, Jan realizes the potential consequences of driving drunk and decides to do the right thing by calling a cab. This responsible choice reflects Jan's moral values as a conscious individual. Jan is prioritizing the safety of themselves and those around them, and as a result, will likely feel a sense of relief, confidence, and pride in their decision-making skills. Furthermore, avoiding the adverse legal and social repercussions of driving under the influence can lead to feelings of gratitude. Ensuring their own safety and that of others by calling a cab can reinforce Jan's sense of accountability and a desire to continue making well-informed choices. In conclusion, it is reasonable to believe that after Jan changed their mind and called a cab instead of driving drunk, they would feel like they made the right choice. This decision would not only prevent potential harm to themselves and others on the road but also instill a sense of satisfaction in contributing to a safer community. Other emotions that Jan may experience include relief, happiness, gratitude, and an increased sense of self-worth and responsibility."},{"question":"Write an article that answers the following question: In the NFC Championship Game between Dallas and the Reskins, how many points more did the Cowboys score than the Redskins?","response":"Title: NFC Championship Game Showdown: Cowboys Outscore Redskins, Defining the Key Moments Introduction The National Football Conference (NFC) Championship between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins was a highly anticipated match-up featuring two powerhouse teams. Fierce rivals, both with their eyes set on the Super Bowl, gave their all in an unforgettable game that had fans on the edge of their seats. In this article, we will be analyzing some of the key moments from the game to determine how many more points the Cowboys scored compared to the Redskins. First Half: Early Glimpse of Cowboys' Offensive Firepower The game kicked off with both teams eager to make their mark, but it was the Cowboys who seized the momentum early. During the first quarter, the Cowboys capitalized on their robust passing game, with quarterback Dak Prescott connecting with wide receiver Amari Cooper for a spectacular 43-yard touchdown.

The first half concluded with a last-minute field goal from Brett Maher, extending the Cowboys lead to 10-0. Second Half: Redskins Attempt to Close the Gap The Redskins came out stronger in the second half, as quarterback Alex Smith orchestrated a well-executed drive that eventually led to a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jordan Reed. With a successful extra point, the Redskins reduced the deficit to 10-7. However, the Cowboys persistently showcased their ability to adapt and control the game. In the third quarter, running back Ezekiel Elliott made a statement with a 23-yard touchdown run. Following another successful extra point, the Cowboys now had a comfortable 17-7 lead. Key Turning Points During the fourth quarter, the game's intensity heightened as both teams displayed desperation to come out as victors. The Redskins managed to capitalize on a Cowboys' defensive blunder with Smith finding wide receiver Josh Doctson in the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown. A successful extra point brought the score to a nail-biting 17-14. Time was running out, and the Cowboys needed to strike again to secure their win. Prescott kept his composure, leading his team down the field for yet another scoring opportunity. The drive culminated with a sensational 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Gallup. Maher's extra point sealed the game for the Cowboys with a final score of 24-14 in their favor. Conclusion: Cowboys Outscore Redskins by 10 Points Breaking down the final score, the Cowboys scored four times in the match, accumulating 24 points.

The reviewer lists a series of issues they experienced with the car seat, beginning with the inability to keep their child securely in the seat due to the harness system being too easy to figure out. This issue poses a significant safety concern, as the primary purpose of a car seat is to restrain a child during car rides. The reviewer also mentions difficulties with the belt and tether straps, stating that their child was able to undo the seat belt. Further supporting the negative tone, the reviewer cites problems with the car seat straps such as daily twisting and difficulty in adjusting them to be tight enough. Another issue raised is the impracticality of the reclining feature, which could not be achieved in either of their vehicles. The one positive aspect that the reviewer acknowledges is the car seat's aesthetic appeal. However, they immediately counter this aspect by emphasizing that appearance is not a factor in ensuring the safety and well-being of a child. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that they eventually purchased a low-cost alternative that successfully kept their child secure in the car seat, suggesting that the original car seat failed to meet their basic expectations. In conclusion, the negative tone heavily outweighs the minor positive remark in this product review. The reviewer's numerous issues and concerns with the car seat's safety, functionality, and overall usability are what shape this unfavorable perspective."},{"question":"Lebanon is in a period of mourning after a massive car bomb killed the former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, on Tuesday.

Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, shook the world. As news of the tragic event spread, journalists scrambled to find details of the incident that would soon become one of the most significant moments in American history. LIFE magazine played a pivotal role in shedding light on the assassination, particularly through the acquisition of the Zapruder film – a crucial piece of evidence capturing the entire event. This article explores the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's assassination, the importance of the Zapruder film, and how LIFE magazine's involvement helped bring this vital piece of historical footage to light. The Assassination of John F. Kennedy On a bright and sunny day in Dallas, Texas, President John F. Kennedy was riding in a convertible limousine during a campaign motorcade through the streets of the city. Crowds had gathered along the route to catch a glimpse of the charismatic leader. As the car made its way through Dealey Plaza, a series of gunshots rang out, and within moments, the President had been struck in the neck and head. Kennedy was rushed to Dallas Parkland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. The assassination sent shockwaves around the globe, with many struggling to come to terms with the horrific act. In the days that followed, the nation was gripped by the unfolding investigation, which led to the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald as the prime suspect. Two days later, Oswald was fatally shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, further deepening the conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's death. The Zapruder Film In the aftermath of the assassination, it became apparent that a Dallas dress manufacturer named Abraham Zapruder had inadvertently captured the entire incident on his 8mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera. Standing atop a concrete pedestal near Elm Street, Zapruder's 26-second film proved instrumental in piecing together the sequence of events that unfolded on that fateful day. The film's significance was immediately recognized, and within hours, representatives from various news agencies sought to purchase the rights to the footage. Recognizing the historic and evidentiary value of the film, Zapruder shared his concerns about the footage's potential to sensationalize or exploit the President's death, ultimately deciding to entrust the material to a reputable publication – LIFE magazine. LIFE Magazine's Involvement On November 23, 1963, one day after the assassination, LIFE magazine's Richard Stolley contacted Abraham Zapruder and persuaded him to grant LIFE the rights to his footage. Zapruder agreed to sell the print rights for 50,000, with the understanding that the footage would be handled with discretion and sensitivity. Zapruder's film ultimately played a pivotal role in shaping the public's understanding of the assassination. In the December 6, 1963 issue, LIFE published a selection of black-and-white frames from the film, accompanied by a detailed article that carefully analyzed the footage. However, the complete film in its original color format remained under lock and key in the magazine's vaults, with only select sections being shared with governmental investigation committees. In 1966, the magazine sold the film back to the Zapruder family for 1, with the agreement that the US government would have access to the footage. This marked the beginning of a lengthy debate over who owned the rights to the film and when, or if, it would be made available to the public. It wouldn't be until March 1975 that the Zapruder film would finally be shown in its entirety on national television by ABC News, reigniting the public's interest in Kennedy's assassination. Conclusion LIFE magazine's acquisition and handling of the Zapruder film played a vital role in unveiling the chilling details of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. By ensuring its discretion, the publication aided in promoting a thoughtful and serious analysis of the incident, without sensationalizing or exploiting the tragedy. As a result, the Zapruder film remains an essential artifact in understanding the events in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, serving as a powerful witness to a moment that would forever change the course of American history."},{"question":"Determine the sentiment: I just saw this film in Santa Barbara.

Sentence 2: Rebbe Schneerson was in a pessimistic mood before Christmas. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. There is a contradiction between the two sentences. The first sentence indicates that Rebbe Schneerson said something last week, two days before Christmas, because he was feeling very good. This suggests that he was in a positive or optimistic mood during that time. On the other hand, the second sentence suggests that Rebbe Schneerson was in a pessimistic mood before Christmas. This contradicts the information provided in the first sentence. In the context of logical entailment, one sentence entails another if the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence under all possible circumstances. In this case, the truth of the first sentence, which indicates that Rebbe Schneerson was feeling good and most likely in a positive mood, does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence that states he was in a pessimistic mood before Christmas. Instead, the two sentences seem to present contrasting moods for Rebbe Schneerson during the same time period. Therefore, we can conclude that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence due to their contradictory nature in portraying Rebbe Schneerson's mood before Christmas."},{"question":"Process: - Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - After several eruptions, the rock builds up and a volcano forms - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the fuel lines are cleaned out happens, how will it affect magma transforms into a volcano above the earths surface. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned, involving the cleaning of fuel lines, does not have any direct or indirect effect on the process of magma transforming into a volcano above the Earth's surface. The reason for this is that the two processes occur in completely different systems and do not influence one another. The formation of a volcano involves geological and geothermal processes, which are dependent on the Earth's internal heat and movement of tectonic plates. The rising of magma through cracks in the Earth's crust, the pressure-induced movement of plates, and the cooling of lava to form new crust all occur independently of any man-made processes, such as fuel line maintenance. Fuel line cleaning is associated with the maintenance of vehicles and machines that run on gasoline or diesel. This process involves removing debris, dirt, and other contaminants from the fuel lines to ensure proper functioning of the engine. While it is true that human activities and industrial processes can sometimes have indirect effects on the environment (for example, through air pollution or climate change), the cleaning of fuel lines specifically does not have any direct bearing or influence on the natural process of volcanic formation. In summary, the cleaning of fuel lines as a supposed perturbation does not have any effect on the process of magma transforming into a volcano above the Earth's surface. The two events occur in completely separate systems and are not connected in any way."},{"question":"Q: Question: how did mohammed gandhi die?

The band built a considerable following, especially in the British counterculture, notably with their albums The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. Following Palmer's early departure, Williamson and Heron performed as a duo, later augmented by other musicians. 1968 was the band's annus mirabilis with the release of their two most-celebrated albums, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter and the double LP Wee Tam and the Big Huge (issued as two separate albums in the US). Hangman's reached the top 5 in the UK album charts soon after its release in March 1968 and was nominated for a Grammy in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin said his group found their way by playing Hangman's and following the instructions. A departure from the band's previous albums, the set relied heavily on a more layered production, with imaginative use of the then new multitrack recording techniques. The album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Williamson songs, such as \\"The Minotaur's Song\\", a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Heron's \\"A Very Cellular Song\\", a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas, its complex structure incorporating a Bahamian spiritual (\\"I Bid You Goodnight\\"). Williamson and Heron in this album had added their girlfriends, Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson, to the band to contribute additional vocals and various instruments, including organ, guitar and percussion. Despite their initially rudimentary skills, Simpson swiftly became a proficient bass guitarist, and some of McKechnie's songs were recorded by the band. By early 1968 the group were capable of filling major venues in the UK. They left behind their folk club origins and embarked on a nationwide tour incorporating a critically acclaimed appearance at the London Royal Festival Hall. Later in the year they performed at the Royal Albert Hall, at open-air festivals, and at prestigious rock venues, such as the Fillmore auditoriums in San Francisco and New York. After their appearance at the Fillmore East in New York they were introduced to the practice of Scientology by David Simons (aka \\"Rex Rakish\\" and \\"Bruno Wolfe\\", once of Jim Kweskin's Jug Band). Joe Boyd, in his book White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s and elsewhere, described how he was inadvertently responsible for their \\"conversion\\" when he introduced the band to Simons, who, having become a Scientologist, persuaded them to enrol in his absence. The band's support for Scientology over the next few years was controversial among some fans and seemed to coincide with what many saw as the beginning of a decline in the quality of their work. In an interview with Oz magazine in 1969 the band spoke enthusiastically of their involvement with it, although the question of its effect on their later albums has provoked much discussion ever since. Their November 1968 album Wee Tam and the Big Huge, recorded before the US trip, was musically less experimental and lush than Hangman's but conceptually even more avant-garde, a full-on engagement with the themes of mythology, religion, awareness and identity. Williamson's otherworldly songs and vision dominate the album, though Heron's more grounded tracks are also among his very best, and the contrast between the two perspectives gives the record its uniquely dynamic interplay between a sensual experience of life and a quest for metaphysical meaning. The record was released as a double album and also simultaneously as two separate LPs, a strategy which lessened its impact on the charts.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they reach the charts in the US?","response":"The text doesn't specifically mention if The Incredible String Band reached the charts in the US."},{"question":"Dayavan: Truth is Power (English: \\"The Compassionate\\") is a 1988 Hindi thriller movie remake of the Tamil film \\"Nayagan\\" (1987).

The park is located in a remote area of Northern Ontario, Canada, and there are no roads or highways that lead to it. Access is restricted to air travel only, typically via floatplane, as the park aims to preserve the natural habitat for its wildlife, especially the polar bears that inhabit the region. Polar Bear Provincial Park is a largely untouched wilderness, and its lack of visitor facilities and infrastructure is part of its appeal as a nature reserve. To visit the park, special permission is required from Ontario Parks, typically in the form of a permit.

Options: - alcohol in - intoxicating - liquid - hair of the dog - harmful","response":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question is \\"liquid gold.\\" Some people really love beer so much that they affectionately refer to it as \\"liquid gold.\\" This term is used due to the color and appearance of the beer, as well as the value and enjoyment it provides to those who are passionate about it. The moniker symbolizes the appreciation and fondness that these individuals have for the beverage, highlighting its significance in their life. While some of the other options, such as \\"intoxicating\\" and \\"hair of the dog,\\" are also related to the consumption of alcohol, they do not accurately answer the question posed. The term \\"intoxicating\\" generally refers to the feeling and effects that one experiences while consuming alcohol, while \\"hair of the dog\\" is an informal expression that refers to consuming more alcohol to alleviate hangover symptoms. On the other hand, \\"alcohol in\\" does not make sense and doesn't seem to be connected to the context of the question, while \\"harmful\\" might be applicable to the negative effects of excessive consumption of alcohol but does not represent the admiration and enthusiasm some people have for beer.

He stepped down and was succeeded by the then Vice-President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, who became the third President of Botswana. Prior to this, he was a leading figure in the independence movement and then the new government, and played a crucial role in facilitating and protecting Botswanas steady financial growth and development. - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates. - Lenyeletse Seretse ( 25 June 1920 -- 3 January 1983 ) was Vice-President of Botswana from 1980 until his death on 3 January 1983 .

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.

I was hoping we could discuss something about astrobiology today. ADA: Good morning, Dr. Vega. Of course, I would be delighted to discuss astrobiology. What topic in particular are you interested in? Dr. Vega: I've been thinking a lot about habitable zones around stars, and the likelihood of finding exoplanets within those zones that could potentially support life. I understand this topic is also referred to as astrobiology. Could you tell me more about this? ADA: Certainly, Dr. Vega. The concept of a habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, comes from the idea that for life as we understand it to exist, a planet must orbit its star at just the right distance. This allows for liquid water, considered a necessity for life, to potentially exist on the planet's surface. Dr. Vega: And I presume our own Earth is in such a \\"Goldilocks\\" zone? ADA: Yes, you're correct. Earth is within the Sun's habitable zone, and obviously, it has conditions necessary for life. However, it's worth noting that the habitable zone is only one factor of many that contribute to a planet's potential habitability. Dr. Vega: I see. What other factors might we need to consider? ADA: Other vital factors include the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, geologic activity, and the stability of its star. For instance, a planet might be in the habitable zone, but if it lacks an atmosphere, its surface could be exposed to harmful solar radiation. Similarly, the absence of geologic activity may mean the planet can't recycle carbon or maintain a stable temperature. Dr. Vega: Fascinating! What about the technologies we are currently using to detect these exoplanets? ADA: Astronomers primarily use methods such as the radial velocity method and the transit method. The radial velocity method looks for tiny wobbles in a star's motion caused by the gravitational pull of a planet, while the transit method observes a star for small dips in light output, which may occur when a planet passes in front of the star. The latter method has been particularly successful with the Kepler Space Telescope and its successor, the TESS mission. Dr. Vega: That's incredible! The universe is truly a fascinating place, isn't it, ADA? ADA: Indeed, Dr. Vega. Our knowledge grows daily, yet the mystery of the universe continues to challenge and captivate us. Dr. Vega: Sometimes, I wonder if we'll ever be able to set foot on one of these exoplanets. ADA: The possibilities are vast, Dr. Vega. Considering the rapid advancements in technology and our continuous drive for exploration and understanding, it's certainly a dream that could one day become reality. Dr. Vega: I sure hope so, ADA. Thanks for the discussion! ADA: It's always a pleasure, Dr. Vega.

When the acidic rain falls back onto the Earth's surface, it has several widespread and detrimental consequences. These consequences affect a range of aspects of the environment and human life: 1. Ecosystem and biodiversity damage: The acidic nature of the rainwater alters the pH levels of soil and water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. These changes in pH can harm or even kill various forms of plant and animal life, affecting the overall ecological balance and reducing biodiversity. 2. Soil degradation: The acidic rainwater can leach essential nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, from the soil. This deficiency in nutrients can result in weaker plants, as well as a reduced ability to absorb other essential elements. Moreover, toxic elements, such as aluminum, can be released from the soil when its pH level is reduced, which can further damage plant life and disrupt the equilibrium of the ecosystem. 3. Water pollution: As acid rain flows into water bodies, it can cause the pH levels to drop, creating unfavorable living conditions for aquatic life. This can lead to a decline in the populations of fish and invertebrates, impacting the entire aquatic food chain. 4. Human health impact: While direct contact with acid rain presents a low risk to human health, the chemicals and pollutants in the rain can enter the food chain through contaminated soil and water sources. This could lead to potential health problems for people consuming affected plants, fish, and other organisms. 5. Damage to human-made structures: Acid rain can also cause significant damage to buildings, monuments, and other infrastructures. The acidic nature of the rainwater can gradually cause corrosion, especially to structures made of limestone and marble, which are predominantly composed of calcium carbonate. This can lead to increased repair and maintenance costs, as well as the potential loss of culturally and historically important structures. In conclusion, the final step of the process involving the release of chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the air and the formation of acidic rain is the falling of this rain back onto the Earth's surface.

On Sunday morning Michael Gunner did the rounds at Nightcliff Markets in Darwin, buying his favourite laksa and being congratulated by locals on winning a landslide victory to government. With about half the votes counted on Saturday night, Mr Gunner said Labor was calling 15 seats and is still in play in six others, with the Country Liberals so far taking one and independents three. It may still be 10 days or so before the final make-up of the government is known, he told reporters. But he said he wanted to speak with the Manufacturers’ Council and the Chamber of Commerce about implementing “Buy Local” plans, and will be seeking a meeting with the Corrections Commissioner and the Department of Justice CEO, as well as Aboriginal peak organisations and the NT Council of Social Services to discuss Don Dale youth detention centre. “(I want) to make sure we start on the right foot even now about how we handle these issues; we want to do them differently, better and together,” Mr Gunner said. He wants to begin establishing an anti-corruption commission and a judicial inquiry into political donations, to talk to the Taxi Council about paving the way for ride sharing, and said Labor’s first homebuyers’ grant would be effective as of Thursday. There are still questions around whether the CLP will win four seats to form a viable opposition, or whether independents will do so. Mr Gunner said he would do “absolutely nothing to cripple accountability”. “We want to have resourced independents and opposition in the NT, I’ m not going to be playing what I would think would be foolish games here with how those people are resourced to hold us to account,” he said. Labor had learned from the CLP’s mistakes over the past term, he said. “We should take those lessons and apply them to the next four (years) and recognise it is a privilege and an honour to be here,” Mr Gunner said. “It can very easily and very quickly be taken away from you if you don ’t honour the commission that’s been granted to you… If you even for a second put your interest ahead of Territorians’ interest you will be gone.” He said the primary emotion he felt on Saturday night was relief, but that the hard work had already begun. “I felt no joy in the result of the CLP, I felt joy in what my team returned,” he said. “They ’re not enemies, they ’re Territorians; I’ d like to think we have a contest of ideas and will continue to have a contest of ideas.” The NT Electoral Commission will resume vote-counting on Monday. What is a short summary of the above article?","response":"The newly-elected Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Michael Gunner, has outlined his priorities for his term in office.

It had a magnitude of 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered near the town of Raboso, in the state of Puebla, about 120 km (75 miles) southeast of Mexico City. The earthquake's shaking itself lasted for approximately 20 seconds. However, the impacts of the earthquake were felt for a much longer time. The event resulted in the loss of 369 lives, injured thousands, and caused widespread structural damage throughout Central Mexico. The states of Puebla, Morelos, and Mexico were the most severely impacted, along with Mexico City. Rescue and recovery efforts were carried out by emergency services, volunteers, and international support teams for several weeks after the earthquake. Search and rescue operations continued until September 28, when the last person was pulled out from the rubble of a collapsed building. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, people throughout Mexico and around the world came together to respond to the disaster. Aid efforts were coordinated by the Mexican government, international aid organizations, and local residents who came together to assist their fellow citizens. The earthquake prompted the Mexican people to unite and demonstrate a tremendous amount of resilience and solidarity. The 2017 Mexico earthquake occurred on the 32nd anniversary of the devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed around 10,000 people and injured more than 30,000. The coincidence of these events led to an increased awareness of the importance of earthquake preparedness and the need for effective building codes and regulations in the country. In the years following the 2017 Mexico earthquake, the Mexican government and various non-governmental organizations have continued to work towards disaster risk reduction, strengthening building regulations, and improving emergency response capabilities. The long-lasting impacts of the earthquake have served as a reminder of the importance of investing in disaster preparedness and response initiatives, not just in Mexico but around the world."},{"question":"Question: Given the following passage \\"Oklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 2010, including four cities over 100,000 in population and 43 over 10,000.

Given the context: How would you describe Ash? Possible answers: alone, inclined to be lazy, creative Answer:","response":"Ash could be described as creative and resourceful in successfully living off the grid. This lifestyle choice entails being self-sufficient, harnessing renewable energy, and reducing dependency on traditional utilities and infrastructure. It requires a great deal of planning, execution, and ongoing maintenance, which suggests that Ash has a proactive and ingenuous mindset. Living off the grid involves developing customized solutions for securing basic needs such as shelter, food, water, and warmth. Ash's ability to independently generate these necessities shows a strong understanding of sustainable design and engineering principles, which are highly creative and innovative fields. As for being alone, it is possible that Ash's off-grid lifestyle could be a solitary one, but it is not necessary to make that assumption. There are communities of individuals who share a similar vision of self-reliance, and Ash could be part of a cooperative network that supports shared resources and knowledge exchange. It would be inaccurate to describe Ash as inclined to be lazy. The rigors of living off the grid demand constant effort and adaptability. Ash would need to manage their power supply, maintain their food production, and deal with unforeseen challenges, such as extreme weather or equipment failure. Successfully navigating these tasks requires motivation, resilience, and hard work. In summary, Ash's choice of living off the grid, and doing so successfully, showcases their creative and resourceful nature. The lifestyle calls for an individual not only to have a strong understanding of sustainable living principles but also to possess the skills and initiative to put those principles into practice. Ash is likely to be proactive, innovative, and dedicated to meeting their basic needs independently."},{"question":"The Purloined Letter - The Purloined Letter is a short story by American author Edgar Allan Poe.

To provide a more accurate star-rating, additional context and details would be necessary. These might include specific aspects the reviewer enjoyed or found valuable, areas they believe could be improved, or a comparison to similar products or experiences. However, if we must assign a rating based on the given term \\"Like,\\" we can infer that the experience was somewhat positive, but not highly detailed or enthusiastic. \\"Like\\" indicates that the reviewer had some level of satisfaction with the product or service, though there are no superlatives or strong positive language used. As such, we can assume that the rating falls in the middle of the rating range, which would provide a ★★★ rating. An accurate assessment would still require more context and details, so it is essential to gather additional information to fully understand the reviewer's perspective and provide a more precise rating."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

He needed to catch a flight, but stayed to long in an object made for humans to relax in. Where might he have been? A. bathroom B. couch C. airport D. homes E. bed The best answer is A:","response":"Danny was a human who needed to catch a flight, which clearly suggests that he must have been at a location that is close to an airport or transit hub. Staying too long in an object made for humans to relax in narrows down the options to places with such objects. With all these details in mind, let's analyze each option: A. Bathroom: A bathroom is a place where humans perform their hygiene rituals and sometimes spend extra minutes in for various reasons. While one might consider it as a place to relax, it is not the primary purpose of a bathroom. Additionally, people generally do not spend excessive time in public restrooms. B. Couch: A couch is an object designed for relaxation, comfort, and informal socializing. Couches can be found in many locations, such as homes, airports, and hotels. While it is plausible that Danny stayed on a couch for too long, it is crucial to remember that he needed to catch a flight. Thus, it is more probable for him to be in a place with easy access to transportation. C. Airport: An airport is a transportation hub that offers various amenities for passengers to relax while they wait for their flights. Since Danny needed to catch a flight, being at the airport seems highly suitable. Furthermore, airports often have resting areas with couches or comfortable seats that can cause passengers to lose track of time. D. Homes: By definition, homes are where people reside and spend most of their time. They usually contain various objects created for relaxation, like beds, couches, and bathrooms. However, considering Danny needed to catch a flight, it would be more logical for him to be in a place offering easy access to transportation. E. Bed: A bed is a piece of furniture designed explicitly for relaxation and sleep. If Danny stayed too long in bed, it would mean he was at home or perhaps in a hotel. However, as mentioned earlier, this scenario is less plausible considering Danny's need to board a flight. Considering all these options, the best answer is C. Airport. Being at the airport would allow Danny to be close to his flight, and airports provide relaxation areas and comfortable seating options that could have caused him to lose track of time, ultimately delaying his departure."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"These men are looking at each others hands.\\" that \\"These men are working on a car.\\"?

Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison's enduring fantasy sequence concerning the fictitious city of Viriconium consists of three novels and various short stories and novels written between 1971 and 1984. Viriconium is known as the Pastel City. Both universal and particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium'. The first book, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with the advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. The more complex second novel is A Storm of Wings (1982). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City. and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Harrison brilliantly depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. The third novel, In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The short story \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (1985; later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\") is set in our world. It explains that Viriconium can be visited via a mirror in a bathroom in a cafe in England.

It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing .

Holmes' lawyer says more women have been illegally strip searched. Lawyer has filed a motion to store all video recordings from inside the jail. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: LaSalle County Police Face Lawsuit over Alleged Illegal Strip Searches, Additional Victims Come Forward Introduction: LaSalle County police and four officers are at the center of a lawsuit filed by Dana Holmes for alleged unnecessary and illegal searches following her DUI arrest. According to Holmes' attorney, more women have come forward claiming to have also been illegally strip-searched. In light of these claims, a motion has been filed to preserve all video footage from inside the jail. Step 1: Detail the Account of Dana Holmes In the article, we'll provide an overview of Dana Holmes' account, which includes her belief that the search was unauthorized, unnecessary, and illegal. We will also mention any possible infringements of her rights or privacy. This section will serve as the basis for the lawsuit and establish a possible pattern of misconduct by the LaSalle County police and the officers involved. Step 2: Discuss Additional Victims and Their Testimonies Next, we will focus on the testimonies of other women who have come forward, providing specific details as to how and when they were allegedly strip-searched. This will emphasize the gravity of the situation and potentially portray systematic behavior on the part of the police force. Step 3: Address the Legal Implications This section will delve into the legal implications of the alleged illegal strip searches. We will consult legal experts and existing laws to understand the possible consequences for the LaSalle County police and the named officers involved. Step 4: Explain the Significance of the Motion to Store Jail Videos We will then explain the motion filed by Holmes' lawyer that demands the preservation of all video recordings from inside the jail. The rationale behind this is to provide evidence for the lawsuit, which may be critical to establishing the truth, and its potential implications on the case. Step 5: Present Statements from Involved Parties An important aspect of the article is to include statements from both Dana Holmes and the LaSalle County police. This will provide readers with balanced perspectives on the matter, allowing them to form their own opinions regarding the allegations made and the stance of the implicated officers. Step 6: Conclusion In this final section, we will summarize the key points of the article, including the growing number of alleged victims and the ongoing legal battle. We will reflect on the possible implications for the LaSalle County police and whether these cases will affect the way law enforcement agencies handle arrests and detentions in the future. By following these steps, we will create an article that accurately, comprehensively, and sensitively addresses the ongoing legal case between Dana Holmes, the additional victims, and the LaSalle County police. This will enable readers to understand the gravity of the allegations and the potential consequences for both parties."},{"question":"{ { Plot } } Tom plays pool in a deserted pool hall , pocketing two balls by lowdown means and then wakes Jerry up by shooting the 10-ball into the pocket where he is sleeping .

An unfortunately fitting title for this utterly disastrous film, which promised dazzling visuals, powerful storytelling, and stellar performances but delivered nothing more than a haphazard, disjointed mess. In this review, I will dissect the specific aspects of the movie that made it such a resounding failure. Directed by Oliver Hapless, the film set out with a promising premise: the journey of a group of ragtag misfits as they confront various obstacles to save a magical land from darkness. However, despite beginning with great potential, the writing and characterization quickly and dramatically faltered. The plot became increasingly convoluted, and it seemed as if Hapless lost sight of any intended theme or message. Instead, what remained was a chaotic jumble of poorly-developed subplots and twists that left audiences with a vague sense of bewilderment. Character development and believability were noticeably absent as well. One might argue that it is the responsibility of the actors to breathe life into their characters, but in this case, it seemed almost as if they had been handed entirely two-dimensional cardboard cutouts to begin with. Tonal discrepancies between individual performances led to a jarring ensemble, only exacerbated by the palpable lack of chemistry. The hero's implausible transformation from bumbling fool to skilled warrior felt forced and unconvincing. Conversely, the antagonist was cartoonishly evil; devoid of nuance or depth. The dialogue was undoubtedly not helpful for the actors either. One ponderous cliche after another dragged the script into the depths of mediocrity. The humor fell flat, the dramatic moments were cringe-worthy, and any attempt at establishing an emotional connection with the audience was mercilessly undermined by the insincerity of the writing. But perhaps the greatest tragedy of \\"The Great Disappointment\\" is its failure on the visual front. Hyped for its grandiose set pieces and cutting-edge special effects, we instead found ourselves assaulted by CGI monstrosities and an excessive use of green screen that served only to pull us out of any semblance of immersion. Grand battles were reduced to an unrecognizable blur of pixels while every landscape was so synthetic that it was impossible to appreciate the potentially breathtaking world the filmmakers had envisioned. Moreover, the film's pacing was unbearably and uneven. With a runtime that overstayed its welcome by at least an hour, the story development oscillated between an excruciating crawl and jarring leaps forward. This, combined with the sporadic editing, made it difficult to follow any sense of narrative progression. It's as though the film struggled to balance exposition with action, leaving behind any hope for a satisfying balance. Lastly, the score accompanying the movie was no better than the rest of its elements. While expected to complement the visual and narrative aspects of the story, the music was either painfully bland or distractingly overblown. Instead of providing an emotional backdrop, the soundtrack added another layer of irritation to an already disheartening experience. In conclusion, \\"The Great Disappointment\\" is an utterly forgettable and dispiriting big-screen debacle that squanders every opportunity for greatness and reveals itself for the vapid, hollow spectacle that it is. You'd be well advised to save your time and money for a more deserving title, as this film will undoubtedly leave a bitter taste in your mouth and a fervent desire to have those painful two hours of your life back."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command's offensives was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare), and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, he declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve \\"a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable.\\" A summary of Harris' strategic intentions was clear:\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","response":"According to the passage you provided from \\"AOC Bomber Command Arthur Harris,\\" the thing that was more imperative to Harris than German morale was the destruction of the German industrial base (economic warfare). He believed that the morale-collapse in Germany could not occur without first destroying the German economy. This objective was the primary aim of Bomber Command's offensives. So, while German morale was an important element for Harris, it was secondary to economic destruction. In other words, Harris believed undermining the economy was a prerequisite to lowering morale, leading ultimately to surrender."},{"question":"Determine the sentiment: There's a good movie lurking here, but this isn't it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved. For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind. Yet they wear surgical masks some times, not others. Some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unconcerned. Worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-be-killed world, these people constantly behave like total newbs. They don't bother accumulating proper equipment, or food. They're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them. So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense. On top of all this, we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd, when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note: arrogant and boneheaded. It's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range. On the positive side, the film *looks* excellent. It's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.","response":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is largely negative. The reviewer acknowledges that the basic premise of the film is good, but they are critical of the movie's execution, specifically its logic and development of characters. They point out inconsistencies in the behavior of the characters, and how their actions often make no sense, undermining any moral struggles presented. There is also dissatisfaction with Chris Pine's acting, as they claim it is limited and lacks variety. However, there is a positive note in this review concerning the film's visuals and appearance, which the reviewer praises as suitable for the setting. Despite this, they ultimately recommend avoiding the movie, even for fans of the genre, as the weak writing and poorly developed characters outweigh the positive aspects."},{"question":"What is the final step of the following process: - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area The answer to this question is:","response":"The final step of the following process is the deposition of acid rain in the affected area, which can cause significant damage to the environment, infrastructure, and living beings. To explain this process in detail, let's break down each individual step: 1. People dig up coal from the ground: Coal is extracted from underground seams through a combination of mining techniques, such as underground or surface mining. The extracted coal is then transported to a power plant or other industrial facilities for use as a fuel source. Coal is a rich source of energy, as it contains large amounts of carbon, which makes it an ideal fuel for producing heat or electricity. 2. People burn coal for heat or electricity: At the power plant or industrial facility, coal is burned in furnaces, producing immense heat that is used to convert water into steam. This steam then drives the turbines connected to the generators, which in turn produce electricity. In other instances, coal is directly burned to produce heat for various applications, such as industrial processes or home heating. 3. Pollution from the coal goes into the sky: Coal combustion emits a mix of hazardous air pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter. These by-products of coal combustion rise into the atmosphere, where they contribute to climate change, air pollution, and an array of negative health effects. 4. Coal pollution enters clouds: Within the atmosphere, pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water vapor and other chemicals, forming sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acidic compounds then bind with water droplets in the air, eventually entering in cloud formations. 5. Clouds rain over an area: When the cloud droplets combine and become heavy enough, they fall to the ground as precipitation. In this case, the rain is acidic due to the presence of sulfuric and nitric acids, which creates the phenomenon known as acid rain. Final step: Deposition of acid rain: As acid rain falls on the affected area, it can have a wide-ranging and detrimental impact on various aspects of the environment, including soil quality, water bodies, forests, and aquatic species. Moreover, acid rain can corrode infrastructure, such as buildings, bridges, and statues, resulting in costly repairs and maintenance. Lastly, acid rain can negatively affect human health by aggravating respiratory illnesses and contributing to various cardiovascular and pulmonary issues. In conclusion, the final step of the process started by mining and burning coal is the deposition of acid rain in the affected regions, causing substantial damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and public health. Awareness of this final consequence of burning coal as an energy source calls for a transition towards cleaner, more sustainable forms of energy production and consumption."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\" Answer: Answer:","response":"Bees are important to plants because they play a vital role in the process of pollination. As mentioned in the context, pollination is essential for the reproduction of most flowering plants. Bees are considered to be one of the most efficient and significant pollinators among insects due to their unique traits, behavior, and abundance. There are several reasons why bees are particularly effective at pollinating plants: 1. Foraging behavior: Bees actively search for nectar and pollen as food sources for themselves and their colony. As they visit different flowers to collect these resources, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another, facilitating fertilization and reproduction. 2. Hairy body structure: Bees possess a hairy body, which helps them efficiently collect and transfer pollen. When a bee lands on a flower, the pollen grains stick to the bee's hairs, and as the bee moves from one flower to another, some of the pollen is dislodged and transferred, enabling pollination. 3. Flower preference: Bees are attracted to specific types of flowers based on factors such as color, shape, and scent. This attraction helps ensure that the right type of pollen is transferred to compatible plants, increasing the chances of successful fertilization. 4. Fidelity: Bees often exhibit flower constancy, meaning they preferentially visit flowers of the same species during a single foraging trip. This behavior increases the likelihood of successful cross-pollination between plants of the same species. 5. Communication: Some bee species, such as honeybees, communicate the location and quality of food sources (flowers) to other members of their colony. This efficient form of communication enables more bees to visit and pollinate a greater number of flowers. The mutualistic relationship between bees and plants benefits both parties: bees obtain nectar and pollen as food sources, while plants receive an efficient pollination service, which is essential for their reproduction. This relationship has driven the evolution of various plant traits (pollination syndromes) that attract different types of pollinators, including bees. The study of these interactions between plants and pollinators, such as bees, is known as anthecology. In conclusion, bees are important to plants because they significantly contribute to the process of pollination, which is vital for the reproduction, genetic diversity, and survival of many flowering plants. This interdependence between bees and plants has led to the coevolution of specialized traits that further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of pollination."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Larry Martin Hagman (September 21, 1931 November 23, 2012) was an American film and television actor, director and producer best known for playing ruthless oil baron J.R.

Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","response":"In general, it is recommended to schedule separate preventive healthcare and sickness visits. Here's the reasoning behind this: 1. Different purposes: Preventive healthcare visits, also known as well visits or routine checkups, focus on maintaining good health and preventing diseases. These visits allow healthcare providers to detect potential issues early on and educate patients about healthy habits and lifestyle choices. On the other hand, sickness visits address specific ailments or concerns that the patient is experiencing. 2. Time management: Preventive care appointments can be lengthy, as they include thorough physical examinations and discussions about overall health. If a patient is also presenting symptoms of illness, the healthcare provider might not have enough time to address both the preventive care and the ailment. 3. Disease transmission: Combining a sickness visit with a preventive healthcare visit could potentially expose the healthcare provider, staff, and other patients to contagious diseases. By keeping those appointments separate, it helps minimize the risk of spreading illnesses. 4. Insurance coverage: Health insurance plans often cover preventive healthcare visits differently than sickness visits. Combining both types of appointments could lead to unexpected costs or billing issues for patients. 5. Better focus and optimal care: By focusing on either preventive healthcare or sickness during a specific visit, healthcare providers can provide better unfragmented care and address the patient's needs more effectively. With these considerations, it's generally encouraged to schedule separate appointments for preventive healthcare and sickness visits to ensure the most effective and thorough care for patients."},{"question":"Translate to Finnish: Any closures must be accompanied by a carefully considered social programme, and that is what is lacking here.

Jessica was able to stay dry in the rainstorm but Erin could not because Available choices: -Jessica had remembered her umbrella.; -Erin had remembered her umbrella.;","response":"Jessica was able to stay dry in the rainstorm but Erin could not because Jessica had remembered her umbrella. This particular day seemed like any other day, but the weather had been quite unpredictable as of late. Jessica and Erin, who were best friends and had known each other since they were kids, had planned to meet up in the park for a well-deserved catch-up session after a long and exhausting week at work. Jessica, known for her meticulous planning, had seen the weather forecast that morning which included a probability of rain. Keeping this in mind, she decided to pack her umbrella just in case. This way, she could ensure that her day wouldn't be disrupted by the whims of nature. On the other hand, Erin, who usually relied on her gut feeling to make decisions, left her house with only a jacket to keep her warm. Even though she noticed the clouds gradually gathering while she was on her way to the park, she didn't think much about the chances of rain. In her mind, she felt confident that a downpour wasn't likely to happen. As both Jessica and Erin arrived at the park, they exchanged warm hugs and got to talking about their personal lives, career accomplishments, and future aspirations. They laughed and shared stories from their past, reminiscing about the memories they had made together. Suddenly, without warning, the dark clouds hovering above unleashed their fury as raindrops came pouring down. Jessica, unfazed by this turn of events, quickly opened her umbrella with a knowing smile. Erin, on the other hand, felt a sinking feeling in her stomach. She glanced at Jessica's umbrella, then looked up at the sky and let out a sigh of disappointment. As the rain fell harder, Jessica's quick thinking and ability to prepare saved her from getting drenched by the rainstorm. Erin, not as fortunate, felt the cold water soak her from head to toe. The damp and chilly conditions led to a less than comfortable experience for her. Although Erin could have felt envious of Jessica's preparedness, she chose instead to appreciate the fact that her best friend was thoughtful and considerate. Jessica, sensing Erin's discomfort, offered her a corner of her umbrella, giving her a chance to dry off a bit. They continued their conversation under the shared umbrella, proving that their friendship was more important than any weather condition. In the end, Jessica's decision to bring her umbrella made all the difference in their experience that day. Erin took it as a lesson and vowed to learn from her friend's foresight and always be better prepared for unpredictable situations.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... The answer to this question is:","response":"Saint-Saëns"},{"question":"Here is a question about this article: Historians see the growing Roman influence over the east, as with the west, as not a matter of intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control. What is the answer to this question: What type of city-states were involved with the Roman Republic?","response":"The city-states involved with the Roman Republic were primarily independent city-states and kingdoms that had varying degrees of independence, both de jure (legally) and de facto (in practice). These city-states and kingdoms maintained alliances and dependencies with Rome, which was the central power in this network. These city-states and kingdoms could be categorized into several groups: 1. Latin and Italian city-states: These were the cities and territories in the Italian peninsula, which were close to Rome and shared its culture and language. Examples include the Latin cities, Etruscan city-states, and the Samnite tribes. They formed alliances with Rome, and many were eventually integrated into the Roman political system as citizens or allies. 2. Greek city-states: These were the cities in the Hellenistic world that stretched from the eastern Mediterranean to western Asia. Important Greek city-states that were involved with the Roman Republic include Athens, Corinth, and Smyrna. They initially entered into alliances with Rome to counter the growing power of the Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom. 3. Hellenistic kingdoms: These large kingdoms were formed in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests and were ruled by his former generals and their successors. They were often involved in wars with Rome or other Hellenistic kingdoms and sought alliances with the Roman Republic. Examples include the aforementioned Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom, as well as the Kingdom of Pergamon and the Kingdom of Macedon. 4. Eastern kingdoms and states: These were the non-Greek territories further east, such as Anatolia, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. They were usually under the rule of local dynasties or Hellenistic rulers who were influenced by both Greek and Eastern cultures. Examples include the Kingdom of Pontus, Nabatean Kingdom, and the Parthian Empire. Their interactions with Rome included both alliances and conflicts, depending on the geopolitical situation at the time. 5. Western Mediterranean and North African states: These were the city-states and kingdoms located primarily in modern-day Spain, France, and North Africa. They were often under the rule of local tribes or dynasties, and their interactions with Rome included both alliances and military conflicts. Examples include the Carthaginian Empire, Numidian Kingdom, and various Celtic and Iberian tribes. Overall, the city-states involved with the Roman Republic were diverse in their origins, cultures, and political structures, and they engaged in a complex web of alliances and dependencies with Rome. As the Roman Republic grew in power and influence, many of these city-states were eventually incorporated into the Roman political system, either voluntarily or through conquest, which contributed to the eventual formation of the Roman Empire."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

'Can' suggests the possibility or potential for federal agencies to adopt 'them' (it's not specified what 'them' refers to, but that's not critical in understanding the logic). It means the agencies are allowed to adopt, but are not compulsorily needed to. On the other hand, the phrase 'will have to' indicates a stronger sense of obligation or necessity. It implies that there's no choice in the matter and federal agencies are absolutely required to adopt 'all' of 'them.' Because the premise only speaks to possibility and not obligation, and doesn't specifically state that every single one of 'them' can be adopted, it's impossible to make a logical jump to the conclusion that federal agencies will have to adopt all of them. The premise doesn't provide enough information to support this hypothesis. Thus, more information would be necessary to confirm this. For example, we would need further data or rules specifying that all options must be adopted once available for adoption, or any other directive or law that mandates such an action from federal agencies.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: The speed of light, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second, is known to be the fastest speed at which information or matter can travel in a vacuum. This is due to the laws of physics as established by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. According to the theory, as an object accelerates closer to the speed of light, its mass effectively increases, which in turn requires more energy for further acceleration. Essentially, the energy requirement approaches infinity as you approach the speed of light, making it nearly impossible for an object with mass to reach or surpass that speed. Furthermore, scientists have conducted numerous experiments, like the famous Michelson-Morley experiment, which have only served to reaffirm the constancy of the speed of light. In all instances studied so far, no evidence has been found that indicates the possibility of faster-than-light travel.

Although they have a similar composition, they have distinct functions and locations within the body. Tendons are fibrous connective tissues that attach muscles to bones, allowing for movement and the transfer of muscular force to the skeleton. They are made up primarily of collagen fibers, which give them strength and elasticity. The collagen fibers in tendons are arranged in parallel bundles, providing them with tensile strength and making them resistant to being pulled apart. In addition to collagen fibers, tendons also contain small amounts of elastin fibers that provide a degree of flexibility, as well as ground substance, which is a gel-like substance that houses various cells and extracellular molecules. Ligaments, on the other hand, are also fibrous connective tissues but serve as connections between bones, providing stability and support, as well as guiding and limiting joint movement. The composition of ligaments is quite similar to tendons. They consist primarily of collagen fibers, elastin fibers, and ground substance. However, there are some differences in the arrangement of these components. In ligaments, the collagen fibers are more loosely arranged and contain a higher proportion of elastic fibers compared to tendons. This structural organization allows ligaments to stretch and provide flexibility while still maintaining the stability of the joints. In summary, both tendons and ligaments are specialized connective tissues that serve different purposes in the musculoskeletal system. Tendons primarily attach muscles to bones and are responsible for transmitting force from muscles to the skeleton, while ligaments connect bones to other bones, ensuring joint stability and limiting movement. Both tissues are primarily composed of collagen fibers, with tendons having a higher collagen content and more longitudinally-aligned fibers, allowing for greater force transmission, and ligaments having a higher proportion of elastic fibers, allowing for flexibility and support during joint motion."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Louis de Noailles, 4th Duke of Noailles (21 April 1713 in Versailles 22 August 1793 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye) was a French peer and Marshal of France.

Article: A fellow speaker from California named Geri flew to Japan, in her favorite jeans and a casual jacket, to give her first speech. Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Geri put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Geri should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Geri hadn't even given them a gift! Question: The third mistake Geri made was that she _ . Options: A: used her own card as a conversation starter B: took her clients' cards with one hand C: kept her clients' cards in a wrong place D: met her clients in jeans Answer:","response":"B: took her clients' cards with one hand"},{"question":"If The technology that shapes the modern world is as incomprehensible to most people as the forces of nature were to a society of hunter-gatherers., can we conclude that \\"They were amazed at the majority of people in tune with the modern world they live in.\\"?","response":"No, we cannot necessarily make the conclusion that \\"They were amazed at the majority of people in tune with the modern world they live in,\\" from the given statement. Here's the stepwise breakdown: 1. Extracting information: The initial statement says, \\"The technology that shapes the modern world is as incomprehensible to most people as the forces of nature were to a society of hunter-gatherers.\\" This indicates that most people do not fully understand the technology shaping the modern world, just as hunter-gatherers did not fully understand nature. 2. Initial reasoning: The statement suggests a lack of understanding among people about modern technology, rather than their familiarity or capability to operate within it. 3. Contradiction identification: The conclusion, \\"They were amazed at the majority of people in tune with the modern world they live in,\\" implies that people are in tune with or adept at navigating the modern world, in this case presumably shaped by technology. This contradicts the initial statement that most people find the technology incomprehensible. 4. Final reasoning: We don't have information that supports surprise or amazement at people's familiarity with the modern world, nor do we know who 'they' refers to. Without further context or information that connects these ideas, we can't directly derive the suggested conclusion from the initial statement. Therefore, based on this analysis, the conclusion does not follow logically from the first statement."},{"question":"doll, Spanish, caught, jerking, chubby, tattoo, creampie Please remove spaces between words.","response":"As an AI language model, I prioritize maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users.

I found the following answer on Google: Go Daddy Group Inc. filed for an IPO in 2006, but later canceled it, due to \\"market uncertainties\\". Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","response":"No, the answer provided only talks about Go Daddy Group Inc.'s IPO filing in 2006 and market uncertainties, but does not give a proper explanation of what GoDaddy.com is. Let me offer a more detailed and complete explanation of GoDaddy.com. GoDaddy.com is an American company offering a wide range of web services and products, primarily focusing on domain registration, web hosting, and website building tools. GoDaddy was founded in 1997 by Bob Parsons under the name Jomax Technologies. Later, the company changed its name to GoDaddy Group Inc., and it has become one of the world's largest domain registrars and web hosting providers. One of the key factors contributing to GoDaddy's success is its aggressive marketing campaigns, which helped the company build a strong brand presence. They often used unconventional and controversial advertisements to generate buzz and attention. These ads played a significant role in establishing GoDaddy as a major player in the web services industry with a reputation for affordable prices and easy-to-use tools. GoDaddy provides various services to individuals and businesses, including: 1. Domain registration: GoDaddy helps users search, register, transfer, and manage domain names for their websites. They offer a vast range of domain extensions, making it possible for individuals and businesses to find a suitable domain for their online presence. 2. Web hosting: GoDaddy offers various web hosting options, such as shared hosting, WordPress hosting, VPS, and dedicated servers. Web hosting plans come with different storage, bandwidth, and performance features to suit the needs of clients with varied budgets and requirements. 3.

Customer support: Known for its comprehensive customer support, GoDaddy provides various channels for users to connect with their support team, such as phone, live chat, and email. They also offer a knowledge base with helpful articles on various topics related to domain management, web hosting, website design, and more. Regarding the IPO filing mentioned in the original answer, it is true that Go Daddy Group Inc. filed for an IPO in 2006 but later canceled it due to market uncertainties. However, a subsequent IPO was successfully filed, and the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol \\"GDDY\\" in April 2015. This successful IPO raised significant capital for the company to expand its global presence and invest in new product offerings. So while the answer you found on Google touched on a historical event regarding the company's IPO, it did not provide a complete explanation of what GoDaddy.com is and the wide range of web services they offer."},{"question":"Write an article using the following points: Carson Ayre born with rare condition meaning his heart was back to front. Three-year-old had to undergo ten-hour life-saving surgery to flip the organ. Doctors then left a hole in his chest for five days while swelling went down. Beating organ was visible through clear bandages placed across the wound. After two weeks recovering in hospital Carson is back at home with parents.","response":"Title: Little Carson Ayre's Amazing Heart Journey Once upon a time in a little town, there was a brave three-year-old boy named Carson Ayre. He was very special because he was born with a rare condition, which means something unusual inside his body was happening. His heart was back to front, just like if you tried to wear a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side! Because Carson's heart needed help, his doctors decided that he needed a big operation to make his heart right. They prepared Carson for a ten-hour long surgery, as long as a whole day at school! In this surgery, they were going to flip his heart, just like flipping a pancake, to make it face the right way in his body. After Carson's doctors finished the big heart flipping surgery, they noticed that his heart was a bit swollen, like a puffy balloon. They wanted to make sure the swelling went down, so they had to leave a little hole in his chest for five days. That's even longer than a whole school week! To keep Carson's heart safe and clean while the swelling went away, the doctors put clear bandages, kind of like a see-through sticker, across the hole in his chest. With these bandages, you could see Carson's strong, little heart beating inside. It was like magic! Carson had to stay in the hospital for two more weeks to heal and get better. That's fourteen whole days of naps, bedtime stories, and visits from doctors! After two weeks of resting and healing, Carson was finally able to go back home with his parents. Carson's story is just like a fairytale where the brave little hero goes on an adventure and comes out even stronger in the end. Now that Carson's heart is back to front, he can run, play, and enjoy life with his family.

First, the movie is exploring the extreme and shows a dark side of the main character, which could be interesting but also frightening for some people. The mention of a \\"killing spree\\" and \\"demonic voices\\" gives a negative and scary feel to the story. Second, the director being mentioned for creating the \\"vilest story ever to be filmed\\" shows that this film is meant to be disturbing and could make some people feel uncomfortable. Third, the comparison with the second installment and mentioning that this is a low budget film shows a bit of negativity but also highlights the uniqueness of the movie. Lastly, the warnings at the end, like not expecting a modern-day horror movie and viewer discretion being advised, tell us that this movie is not for everyone and could upset some viewers. So it is a cautionary sentiment for potential viewers to be aware of what they are getting into."},{"question":"Two brothers went to the doctor's office for an appointment. The doctor discovered that Tim had very high levels of cholesterol, while Jim had normal levels. Which brother had fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","response":"Jim had fewer plaques that can restrict blood flow since his cholesterol levels were normal, while Tim had high cholesterol levels which are associated with the formation of plaques and atherosclerosis."},{"question":"Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur in India . Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur , Nadaun , India . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","response":"No, the two sentences do not essentially mean the same thing, even though they might seem similar at first glance. Let's break down both these sentences to understand why. 1. \\"Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur in India.\\" This sentence tells us that there is a village named Jalari, and it is situated somewhere within the district of Hamirpur, which is in India. However, it does not provide any further information about the specific location of the village within Hamirpur. 2. \\"Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur, Nadaun, India.\\" This sentence is more specific about the location of Jalari. Not only does it state that Jalari is in Hamirpur, India but also that it is within the sub-district or tehsil of Nadaun. The mention of Nadaun distinguishes this sentence from the first one, offering more specific geographical information. Nadaun is actually a tehsil (a type of administrative division in India which is smaller than a district but larger than a village) within the district of Hamirpur. Therefore, this sentence provides a more specific geographic context and tells you exactly where the village of Jalari is located. To put this in perspective, saying \\"Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur in India\\" might be a bit like saying \\"Springfield is a city in the United States.\\" There are many cities named Springfield in various states across the country, so this information alone does not specify exactly where the city is located. On the other hand, saying \\"Jalari is one of the villages of Hamirpur, Nadaun, India\\" is a bit like saying \\"Springfield is a city in Illinois, United States.\\" This statement is way more precise because it points you to a specific Springfield - the one in Illinois state. In conclusion, while both sentences indicate that Jalari is a village in Hamirpur, India, the second sentence is more precise as it provides further details about Jalari's location within the tehsil of Nadaun."},{"question":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? directed , barely , by there","response":"Based on the text provided, it is not possible to determine whether the review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie.

Vocalizing opinions about the overall enjoyment, relatability, and the emotional impact of the movie would also give us a better understanding of whether the movie is well-received or not.

Follow along with the steps in the solution below: 1. Start with the given equation: -10*i + 2 = -8*i 2. Move all terms with \\"i\\" to one side of the equal sign, and the constant terms to the other side. To do this, add 10*i to both sides to eliminate the -10*i from the left side, and subtract 2 from both sides to eliminate the constant from the right side: -10*i + 10*i + 2 - 2 = -8*i + 10*i - 2 3. Simplify both sides of the equation: 2 = 2*i 4. Now, we have the simplified equation: 2 = 2*i 5. To find the value of i, divide both sides by 2: 2 / 2 = 2*i / 2 6. Simplify: 1 = i Now, after going through these steps, we have found that the value of i is 1. So, the solution to the problem is: i = 1"},{"question":"Translate to Turkish: Tenancy rights are still one of the key problems that have made finding a housing solution for refugees even harder.

Emotional Attachment: Your description of the dress as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"perfect\\" suggests strong emotional attachment and anticipation for its arrival.

Importance of the Dress: The mention of the specific dress - JCrew's Silk tricotine Cecelia gown - hints that it might be a significant or high-quality piece of clothing. JCrew is known to be a reputable brand, and the specific design of the gown could have had you waiting anxiously due to its importance in your wardrobe or a particular event you plan to attend. 3. Long Wait Time: You mentioned that you had been waiting since Sunday, suggesting that you had been anticipating the arrival of this dress for a longer period. This extended wait time can understandably make you feel anxious, especially if you were eagerly looking forward to receiving and wearing the dress. 4. Uncertainty around Delivery: The anxieties waiting for the dress may also have been linked to uncertainties surrounding the delivery process, such as whether the package would arrive on time, or arrive in good condition without any issues. This type of anxiety is common when ordering something important or valuable online. 5. Impact on Self-esteem: Receiving a beautiful and perfect dress, like the JCrew's Silk tricotine Cecelia gown, may positively impact your self-esteem and confidence. The dress would likely enhance your physical appearance and make you feel elegant or fashionable, which might cause anxiety as you wait to experience those positive feelings upon wearing the dress.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Sell them? The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has deemed them unfit to live in, has outraged consumer advocates and environmentalists by agreeing to sell them, according to a story in The Washington Post. FEMA acknowledges the units have excessive levels of formaldehyde, a chemical that can cause nasal cancer and worsen respiratory problems, and might also have mold, mildew and propane gas leaks. \\"What if Toyota ordered a recall, then simply put a sticker on its vehicles saying they were unfit to drive before reselling them?\\" Becky Gillette, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club in Mississippi, which helped uncover the formaldehyde problem, says in the story. \\"There's a double standard for the government.\\" Critics worry the units could be resold many times, and unscrupulous sellers might remove the required warning label that says \\"not to be used for housing.\\" FEMA officials defend the sale, saying Congress has complained about spending 220 million over three years to store vacant units. \\"I'm certainly hopeful we're approaching the end of the story for the Katrina units, which we have been maintaining in the hundreds and thousands of units, at the expense of taxpayers,\\" FEMA Associate Deputy Administrator David Garratt says in the story. The sale will be finalized April 3, pending an antitrust review by the Justice Department. The Washington Post reports that FEMA sold most of the units at a massive auction Jan. 29 for 133 million, or about 7 cents on the dollar compared with what the government paid.

Include name, phone number, city and state for verification. To view our corrections, go to Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"The question of whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should sell the contaminated trailers they bought for Hurricane Katrina victims is a complex one. The controversy stems from the fact that these trailers have been contaminated with formaldehyde, a potentially harmful substance which can cause nasal cancer, exacerbate respiratory issues, and be a source of mold, mildew and propane gas leaks. While FEMA acknowledges the presence of these hazards, they have still chosen to sell the trailers. According to critics, such as Becky Gillette of the Sierra Club in Mississippi, this decision is akin to a car manufacturer recalling a vehicle due to safety concerns, then attaching a label stating it's \\"unfit to drive\\" and selling it again. Critics' fears are compounded by the possibility that there may be no control over what happens to the trailers after their initial sale, as unscrupulous subsequent sellers might remove the warning label, thereby endangering future users who might use the trailers as housing. FEMA defends their decision by pointing to budgetary constraints. They argue that Congress has complained about the cost of storing the vacant units, which amounts to approximately 220 million over three years. Therefore, FEMA Associate Deputy Administrator David Garratt expresses hope that the sale of the units could signify the \\"end of the story.\\" Critics, however, contend there should be a higher responsibility towards the health and safety of potential dwellers, warning against potential health risks. They argue that the monetary value doesn't justify selling tainted housing units and putting people at risk. There's also some public sentiment that suggests that FEMA, being a government agency, ought to act with more diligence. This debacle underscores a challenging ethical issue at the intersection of economics and public health. On one hand, there's an argument for financial responsibility and efficiency, and on the other, there's a strong case for the right to safe and healthy housing. It also highlights a broader problem of waste and inefficient resource management in times of crises - in an ideal world, these trailers wouldn't have been deemed unfit for use in the first place, particularly given the stringent need for housing in the aftermath of natural disasters. Ultimately, whether the sale proceeds or not should be governed by rigorous ethical guidelines and comprehensive health assessments to protect the safety of potential occupants. If the trailers are found to be potentially harmful, alternatives should be explored. This could involve finding ways to effectively treat and decontaminate the trailers so they're safe for use, or possibly repurposing them for non-residential uses where the health risks would be minimized or eliminated. One thing is certain - this issue demands a resolution that balances financial prudence with a fundamental commitment to public health and safety."},{"question":"In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question.

The answer to this question is:","response":"Lund"},{"question":"Answer this question. Which language is common to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism?","response":"Sanskrit is the common language to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that has its roots in the Indian subcontinent. Often referred to as the \\"mother\\" of many of the modern Indian languages, Sanskrit has played a significant role in the development of these religions, providing a common linguistic ground for their texts, scriptures, and philosophical discussions. 1. Sanskrit in Hinduism: Sanskrit is integrally connected to Hinduism and has been considered the sacred language of the religion. It is the language of the ancient Hindu scriptures, called the Vedas, which contain various hymns and incantations, as well as the Upanishads, which are philosophical texts that discuss the nature of reality and human existence. The two great Hindu epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are also written in Sanskrit. The language is also used in various Hindu rituals, prayers, and ceremonies. Scholars dedicated to the study of Hinduism have largely studied the religion and its texts in Sanskrit, as it provides an accurate understanding of the material and captures the nuances of the original text. 2. Sanskrit in Buddhism: Though the Buddha himself gave sermons in the local languages of the regions he traveled, many Buddhist texts were later recorded in Sanskrit. This language provided a common mode of communication for the diverse Buddhist communities that emerged throughout India and neighboring countries. The major Buddhist scriptures, known as the Mahayana Sutras, were written in Sanskrit. Some of the important texts include the Heart Sutra, the Diamond Sutra, and the Lotus Sutra. Additionally, many early Buddhist philosophers, such as Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, and Asanga, wrote treatises and commentaries in Sanskrit, which played a significant role in the development of Buddhist thought. 3. Sanskrit in Jainism: Jainism, another major religion of the Indian subcontinent, also shares its connection with Sanskrit. Jain canonical texts, called Agamas, were initially passed down orally in the local language of Ardha Magadhi, but they were later translated into Sanskrit to reach a broader audience and to preserve the teachings of Jainism from oblivion. Some key Jain texts like the Tattvartha Sutra, a comprehensive work on Jain philosophy, and the Jaina Sutras, which contain the teachings of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, were written in Sanskrit. The language has also been used by Jain scholars to compose commentaries and expositions on various aspects of Jainism, such as the celebrated work 'Dravyasamgraha' by Acharya Nemicandra. In conclusion, Sanskrit is the common language that connects Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It has been the language of scriptures, prayers, literature, and philosophical debates in these religions, contributing to their development and expansion. It has become a classical language of India and continues to be indispensable for those who study these religions and their texts from a historical and scholarly perspective."},{"question":"Write a sentence in English.","response":"Although the breathtaking view from atop the gently rolling hill captivated the hearts of the group of childhood friends, the vibrant hues of the setting sun, mixed with the melodic song of the crickets and the faint laughter of the people enjoying the quaint little carnival below, painted a mesmerizing portrait both ephemeral and eternal, reminding them vividly of the impermanence of youth and the profound bond they shared, that would bridge the inevitable gaps of time and distance, as they set out on their individual journeys to embrace life's myriad enigmas and bittersweet memories, carrying within them the warmth of this unforgettable day."},{"question":"Add punctuation: Technical Analysis ARMOUR GROUP Investtech","response":"Technical Analysis: ARMOUR GROUP - Investtech At Investtech, we specialize in providing expert insights and technical analysis for various companies, including ARMOUR GROUP.

Article:","response":"Title: North Korea Detains 85-Year-Old American Tourist Merrill Newman Amid Tensions An 85-year-old American tourist, Merrill Newman, from California was detained by North Korean authorities three weeks ago, according to the Bay Area News Group. The Californian native, who is a Korean War veteran, was on a tourist plane that was about to leave the country last month when he was removed from the aircraft by North Korean officials. Merrill Newman, an avid traveler, had embarked on his journey to North Korea with a neighbor from Palo Alto, utilizing a tourist company based in Beijing for their trip. The motive for his detention is still unclear, with Newman's neighbor stating that it might be a \\"terrible misunderstanding\\" and expressing hope for a speedy resolution. \\"I hope that the North Koreans see this as a humanitarian matter and allow him to return to his family as soon as possible,\\" the neighbor said. The North Korean government and the US State Department have not officially confirmed the detention, yet the US agency revealed that they were aware of the situation involving Newman. In light of this, the State Department issued a travel advisory to Americans, cautioning them of \\"arbitrary\\" arrests that may occur in North Korea.

No While the statement does mention Sir Edwin Lutyens and his involvement in city planning for New Delhi during the British Raj, it does not provide a detailed and comprehensive answer to the question. The statement touches on the decline of neoclassicism, but it is not sufficient for addressing the key aspects of the topic. A more detailed and long answer could be: Sir Edwin Lutyens' city planning in New Delhi marked a significant shift in architectural design and urban planning during the British Raj in India. Lutyens, a renowned British architect, was commissioned to design the new capital of India in 1911, after it was decided to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi. This project was a monumental task, as it was meant to symbolize the power and prestige of the British Empire in India. Lutyens' plan for New Delhi is an excellent example of the use of urban planning principles and a distinct shift away from the neoclassical architectural style that dominated European architecture in the 19th century. Instead, Lutyens introduced a unique blend of classical European and traditional Indian architectural elements, marking a departure from the strict neoclassical style that was prevalent in other colonial cities. He designed several key buildings and monuments in New Delhi, including the Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan), the Parliament House, the India Gate, and various other government buildings. The layout of the city also diverged from previous urban planning methodologies used by the British in India. Lutyens embraced a more organic layout that allowed the city to grow and evolve, rather than sticking to a rigid grid system. The plan incorporated wide, tree-lined avenues and large open spaces, which were intended to create a sense of grandeur befitting a capital city. To ensure the integration of the new city with the existing old town of Delhi, Lutyens planned for several major roads to radiate outwards from Connaught Place, the city's central business district, in a star-shaped pattern. This layout enabled the city to expand naturally while preserving its historical core. Furthermore, Lutyens' design for New Delhi embraced the diverse culture and tradition of India. He incorporated traditional Indian architectural elements, such as chattris (domed pavilions), jaalis (perforated screens), and chajjas (overhanging eaves), in his buildings. This blending of styles showcased the unique identity of India while also asserting British dominance. In conclusion, Sir Edwin Lutyens' city planning in New Delhi marked a shift in design as it moved away from strict neoclassical European styles and embraced a combination of European and Indian architectural features. The planning principles introduced by Lutyens allowed for the organic growth of the city, while his fusion of architectural styles showcased the rich cultural heritage of the region."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The Alice clones (Milla Jovovich) attack Umbrella HQ, Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a tiltrotor plane and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive sinkhole; however, the real Alice boarded beforehand.

Choices: - noise - knocking over - put down - doesn - water mark The rationale to choose \\"water mark\\" as the answer is that: A:","response":"The rationale to choose \\"water mark\\" as the answer is that: 1. Preventing Condensation and Moisture: When a cold or hot beverage is placed on a table, the temperature difference between the cup and the surrounding environment can cause condensation to form. This moisture can then leave a water mark on the table's surface. Placing a napkin under the cup will absorb the moisture and protect the table from any potential water marks. 2. Preserving the Table Surface: Water marks can result from both hot and cold beverages, and they can damage the finish of the table. By placing a napkin beneath the cup, Bill is ensuring that the table's surface remains intact and aesthetically pleasing. 3. Protecting Tableware and Tablecloth: If the table has a tablecloth, water marks can also form on the fabric, making it appear stained or sullied. The napkin acts as a barrier to prevent the transfer of moisture from the cup to the tablecloth. 4. Proper Table Etiquette: It is considered proper table etiquette to use coasters or napkins beneath cups and glasses to avoid creating water marks on a table. Bill is demonstrating good manners and respect for the table's owner by taking this precaution. The other choices provided do not offer the same level of protection and consideration: - Noise: A napkin might slightly muffle the sound of placing a cup down, but its primary purpose is not to reduce noise. - Knocking Over: A napkin does not offer significant assistance in preventing a cup from being knocked over. - Put Down: This choice does not refer to a specific issue that might be created by placing a cup directly on a table. - Doesn: This choice is a typo and does not provide any meaningful explanation. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"water mark\\" as the answer lies in its effectiveness at preventing damage to the table surface, preserving tableware, following proper table etiquette, and protecting tablecloths from moisture."},{"question":"What would be an example of an negative review?","response":"Title: Extremely Disappointing Experience Review: I am usually not one to write negative reviews, but my experience at \\"The Starlit Cafe\\" has left me with no other option than to share my thoughts and warn others about what they might encounter there. Firstly, I made a reservation a week in advance but when I arrived with my friends, the staff seemed to be clueless about it. We patiently waited for 30 minutes, hoping they would find a solution. Eventually, they managed to squeeze us in at a table near the restroom, certainly not the ideal location for a relaxing evening we were looking forward to. The interior of the restaurant looked dated and in dire need of a makeover. The lighting was too dim making it difficult to read the menu, and the overall atmosphere felt gloomy and unwelcoming. As for the menu, there was an inadequate selection of dishes, and it lacked creativity. Considering the price range, I expected a lot more variety and innovative culinary creations. After much deliberation, we ordered the lobster bisque, Caesar salad, and grilled salmon with roasted vegetables. Our appetizers took nearly 30 minutes to arrive, and when they finally did, we were dismayed by the portion sizes. The lobster bisque tasted bland and had a watery consistency, whereas the Caesar salad was merely a few pieces of lettuce with a drizzle of dressing and a sprinkling of stale croutons. Moving on to the main course, the grilled salmon was overcooked and dry, to the point where it was almost inedible. The vegetables served alongside were oily and appeared to have been sitting under heat lamps for an extended period. During our entire meal, not once did our server check in on us or ask about the quality of the food. Perhaps, they were aware of it themselves. To make matters worse, the noise level in the cafe was unbearable. We could hardly have a conversation without shouting, and the music playing in the background was far too loud for a dining establishment. After such a disappointing meal, we decided to skip dessert, fearing the worst. When the bill arrived, the total amount was much higher than anticipated. It was shocking to see such exorbitant prices for the low-quality food we were served. In conclusion, our experience at \\"The Starlit Cafe\\" was utterly disappointing, and I cannot recommend it to anyone, given the poor level of service, the underwhelming menu, and the overall lack of ambiance. There are plenty of other dining options in the area that offer better value for money, high-quality food, and a welcoming atmosphere. It is a shame because I had high hopes for this place, but our dinner was a letdown from start to finish."},{"question":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales Answer:","response":"The final step of the process you described is packaging the sorted materials into bales following their journey through a baler machine. This is a process widely used in waste management and recycling facilities, and it essentially involves the careful maintenance and organization of materials to ensure they are managed in the most environmentally-friendly and cost-effective way possible. When items are initially collected, they could come from a variety of sources - homes, businesses, construction sites, and so on. The collected items come in every conceivable form - paper, plastics, metals, glass, organic waste, etc. This mishmash of items then goes into a sorting process, where they are divided according to their type. The next step involves removing any trash or non-recyclables from the sorted materials. It's not unusual for unwanted items to end up in recycling centers, and these must be appropriately discarded to prevent contamination of the recyclables. Following this step, the trash removed is typically sent to a landfill - a designated area for the disposal of waste material. Once the items have been thoroughly sorted and any trash removed, they're typically transferred to a baler machine. This machine is designed specifically for condensing recyclable materials into compact, easy-to-handle blocks - or 'bales'. Each type of material - plastics, cardboard, aluminum, etc. - are loaded into the baler, which uses hydraulic force to crush and tightly pack the materials into bales, tying them with wire or strapping to hold them together. The final step then, after the sorted items have been processed through the baler, is that they come out as bales. These bales are considerably easier to transport and store than loose materials, making it a beneficial step in the recycling process. These compact bales of recyclable material are then stored until they are transported to a facility for the next step in their recycling journey, usually a recycling plant where they can be turned back into valuable resources. So, in summary, the final step in the process described is the production of compact, easy-to-handle bales of sorted materials. These bales are then ready for transportation and further recycling, taking us one step closer towards a more sustainable, waste-free world."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971.

OPTIONS: [1]. Fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a blanket to put in an envelop.Folding the dough will create flaky layers throughout the biscuit.; [2]. Fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a letter to put in an envelop.Folding the dough will create flaky layers throughout the biscuit.; Answer:","response":"The best way to create flaky layers in biscuits is to use option 2: Fold the dough into thirds like you would fold a letter to put in an envelop. Folding the dough will create flaky layers throughout the biscuit. In order to achieve the perfect flaky layers, it is important to follow these steps: 1. Prepare ingredients: Make sure your ingredients are measured accurately and your butter is cold. Cold butter is crucial for creating flaky layers within the dough. When it melts, it creates pockets of air, resulting in a flaky texture. 2. Combine ingredients: In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Afterward, cut the cold butter into small cubes. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter, fork, or your fingertips to rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 3. Add liquid ingredients: Stir in the cold milk or buttermilk, which helps to create tender layers in the biscuits. Be careful not to over-mix the dough; this can result in tough, hard biscuits. 4. Roll out and fold the dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently press the dough into a rectangle. To create the flaky layers, fold the dough into thirds, like you would fold a letter to put in an envelope. Then, press and roll out the dough again, repeating this folding process at least 2-3 times. This technique will result in multiple layers of dough, ensuring flakiness throughout. 5. Cut biscuits: Use a round biscuit cutter or a knife to cut out the biscuits. Press straight down without twisting, as twisting can seal the layers and prevent the biscuits from rising. 6. Bake: Place the cut biscuits onto a lined baking sheet, making sure they are close together but not touching. Bake in a preheated oven (usually around 425°F / 220°C) for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. 7. Serve: Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before enjoying them. They are best served warm, with a pat of butter or a dollop of jam. By following these detailed steps and folding the dough like a letter, you will be able to create the desired flaky layers in your homemade biscuits."},{"question":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale. Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first.... The answer to this question is:","response":"The name for when a tsunami does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path is called a \\"tsunami inundation.\\" In this phenomenon, the tsunami moves into shallower water, causing the wave to slow down and its height to increase. When it reaches the coast, it can rush inland and flood the area without necessarily breaking like a typical ocean wave. This inundation can cause extensive damage and flooding in coastal areas."},{"question":"Read this: In the United States, \\"Cultural Studies\\" focuses largely on the study of popular culture, that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods.

Has anyone else ever heard your voice? Again you say, \\"Of course.\\"But that's not quite true. Nobody else has ever heard your voice--the way you hear it. When you talk, you set up sound waves . The air outside your head carries the sound waves to your outer ears. But, of course, the sound of your voice begins inside your head. The bones of your head pick up the sound waves, too. They carry the sound waves straight to your inner ears. You get the sound from the outside and the inside too. Other people get just the sound waves from the outside. That's why they don't hear your voice the way you do. When you talk, other people hear your voice _ . A) through the bones of your head B) from the outside C) from the inside D) all of the above The answer is:","response":"B) from the outside The phenomenon of hearing one's own voice differently is fascinating and somewhat perplexing. It stems from the way that sound waves travel both through the air and through the bones of our head. When we speak, we create sound waves that propagate through our vocal cords, larynx, and mouth, which then reverberate and radiate through the surrounding environment. These sound waves can travel in multiple directions and media, which ultimately affect how we perceive our own voice compared to how others perceive it. As you mentioned, when we speak, we set up sound waves within our head that are then picked up by the bones and carried to our inner ears. This occurs through a process called bone conduction, which is essentially the conduction of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull. Simultaneously, the air outside our head carries the sound waves to our outer ears through a process known as air conduction. The fusion of both air conduction and bone conduction allows us to perceive our own voice differently than those around us. Other people, however, only experience the sound waves from the outside. When they listen to your voice, they receive the sound waves solely through air conduction, as the sound waves travel through the air from your mouth to the listener's outer ear. The unique blend of sound waves transmitted directly through the bones of your head is something that only you can experience. Consequently, your voice may appear different to others than what you perceive it to be. As a result, the correct answer to the question, \\"When you talk, other people hear your voice _,\\" is B) from the outside. This is because the sound waves traveling through the bones of your head are not detected by others, and only the external sound waves produced by your voice are perceived by their outer ears through air conduction."},{"question":"Question 1: How can a person block answers and feed from Indians on Quora?

Other colors, such as yellow, green, blue and orange, are due to other minerals. - Afrikaans (, or ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia, and to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as \\"Cape Dutch\\" (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers) or \\"kitchen Dutch\\" (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days).

Rangel, his gaze steady and his hands clasped before him, stood silently in the well of the House of Representatives on Thursday as Speaker Nancy Pelosi somberly read a resolution censuring him for bringing discredit to the House. Ms. Pelosi issued the punishment minutes after the House voted 333 to 79 for the censure, the most severe sanction it can administer short of expulsion. The vote made Mr. Rangel, a Democrat, the 23rd member of the House to be censured, and the first in nearly three decades. After receiving his punishment, Mr. Rangel, 80, asked for a minute to address his colleagues and told them: “I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety.” Mr. Rangel and his allies had pleaded for mercy, arguing that his transgressions, which included failure to pay income taxes and misuse of his office to solicit fund-raising donations, deserved the more lenient punishment of a reprimand. But that effort failed, 267 to 146. Photo The censure marks a staggering fall for Mr. Rangel, who has represented Harlem for half of his life, and had risen to become one of the most prominent and well-liked members of Congress. Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, called upon Mr. Rangel to appear before her, and, in a subdued tone, read the one-paragraph resolution noting his 11 violations of Congressional ethics rules. Still, talking to reporters after leaving the House floor, Mr. Rangel’s old pugnacity returned as he denounced the vote as partisan. “I am confident that when the history of this has been written,” he said, “people will recognize that the vote for censure was a very, very, very political vote.” Referring to misdeeds of others who had been censured, he said: “I did not curse out the speaker. I did not have sex with minors. I did not steal money.” When a reporter asked him what he felt as he stood in the well, he asked, “Are you a licensed psychiatrist?” Only two Republicans, Representatives Peter T. King of New York and Don Young of Alaska, voted against the censure resolution. African-American members largely stood with Mr. Rangel, too, with just one member of the Congressional Black Caucus casting a vote for the censure. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “I have never heard anyone question Charlie Rangel’s integrity,” Mr. King said in his remarks on the House floor. Mr. Rangel, a veteran of the Korean War and the civil rights movement, has been one of the most recognizable political figures in New York and Washington, known for his feisty advocacy of liberal policies. When Democrats seized control of the House in 2006, he earned the title of his career: chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. That prominence, however, was short-lived. In July 2008, news reports detailed his acceptance of several rent-stabilized apartments from a Manhattan real estate magnate at prices far below market. Mr. Rangel denied any wrongdoing but asked the ethics committee to investigate. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In the months that followed, new problems emerged, including his failure to pay taxes on rental income from a villa in the Dominican Republic or to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets on financial disclosure forms. Mr. Rangel’s fund-raising for a City College school being built in his honor also became part of the ethics inquiry because he used Congressional stationery and postage to request donations and asked for contributions from companies and executives with business before Congress. In one case, Mr. Rangel’s committee helped preserve a tax loophole worth hundreds of millions of dollars for an oil-drilling company that pledged 1 million. Mr. Rangel denied using his office to benefit donors or to enrich himself, saying he was guilty only of bookkeeping errors. But under heavy pressure, he gave up his cherished chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. After dragging out the ethics investigation for two years with aggressive legal challenges, Mr. Rangel walked out of a public hearing on the matter last month, saying he no longer could afford a lawyer. The ethics committee brushed aside his objections and found him guilty of 11 of 13 charges against him. While the vote on Thursday seemed a foregone conclusion, suspense built when Mr. Rangel’s allies forced a floor vote on a motion to reduce the punishment to a reprimand. They argued that his misconduct did not approach the seriousness of others who had been censured, and that such a sanction would be extreme. The last two members who were censured, for example, had each been found guilty of having sexual relations with a Congressional page. Mr. Rangel received unexpected support from Representative John S. Tanner of Tennessee, a leader of the conservative Blue Dog Democrats. “As a lawyer, I also respect precedent,” said Mr. Tanner, who urged his colleagues to vote for a reprimand. “I have searched this record and find no activity involving moral turpitude, or any activity that could be classified as one with criminal intent.” Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who took part in the ethics committee’s investigation, also urged members to use restraint in meting out punishment. “He knows he messed up,” Mr. Scott said. “He knows he will be punished. He just asks that he is punished like everyone else.” The remarks echoed those contained in an e-mail that Mr. Rangel had sent to some 25,000 constituents and admirers over the past week, in which he asked them to call their representatives and seek mercy for him. “I brought it on my myself, but I still believe this body has to be guided by fairness,” Mr. Rangel said, repeatedly asserting that he had not tried to enrich himself by his actions. But other members said Mr. Rangel’s violations were too serious to warrant only a reprimand. Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the ethics committee, said that in the past, censure had been used for members who had used unparliamentary language and that Mr. Rangel had promised voters that Democrats would run the most ethical Congress in history. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard,” Ms. Lofgren said. “Mr. Rangel himself has acknowledged that.” Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who sits on the ethics committee, said members needed to take a firm stand in order to restore the public’s trust in Congress, which is near all-time lows. “Credibility is exactly what is at stake at here,” Mr. McCaul said. “The credibility of the House of Representatives before the American people.” Mr. Rangel’s long battle over the ethics charges has transfixed New York City’s political establishment and set off speculation about how long he will remain in office. Several Democrats are eyeing the seat, but no major figure dared to challenge Mr. Rangel this year, when he easily won re-election. After the censure vote, reporters pressed the congressman about whether he would serve out the rest of his term, and run again. “At my age,” he replied, “I don’t buy green bananas.” ||||| The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to censure Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.), who pleaded for leniency but now finds his 40-year career tarnished after his colleagues rebuked him using a rare form of public punishment for ethics violations. The vote was 333-79, with 77 Democrats and two Republicans voting against censure, the harshest form of punishment short of expulsion from Congress. Text Size - + reset VIDEO: Rangel censured VIDEO: Rangel reacts POLITICO 44 Immediately following the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally called on the 80-year-old Rangel to stand in the well of the House to be informed that he had indeed been censured by his colleagues for series of 11 ethics violations. Rangel obliged, rising from the center-aisle seat in the front row. He stood, feet shoulder-width apart with one hand clasped over the other in front of his waist. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and New York delegations crowded into the first two rows behind him. The ordeal was over in about 45 seconds, bringing a surprisingly anti-climatic end to a long battle that cost Rangel his gavel at the Ways and Means Committee and 2 million in legal fees, and nearly jeopardized his four-decade hold on a Harlem congressional district. “By its adoption of House Resolution 1737, the House has resolved that Rep. Charles B. Rangel be censured, that Rep. Charles B. Rangel forwith present himself in the well of the House for the pronouncement of censure, that Rep. Charles B. Rangel be censured by the public reading of this resolution by the speaker, and that Rep. Rangel pay restitution to the appropriate taxing authorities for any unpaid taxes … on income received from his property in the Dominican Repbublic and provide proof of payment to the [House ethics] committee,” Pelosi intoned. It marked the first time in 27 years that the House had censured a member and only the 23rd time a lawmaker had been subject to that sanction that in the past 180 years. But for all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the censure ritual, that’s basically the end of the process for Rangel, who will return as a member of Congress in the next session. Rangel’s allies had earlier attempted to downgrade the punishment to a reprimand, meaning a resolution condemning him would be read into the Congressional Record, but that motion – offered by Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) – was defeated by a 267-146 margin. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) voted for Butterfield motion, but Pelosi didn’t vote and most of her Democratic allies rejected it. In the end, more than 105 Democrats voted against the Butterfield motion. With the reprimand alternative out of the way, the House was cleared for a final vote on the censure resolution. Rangel was found guilty by the ethics panel of 11 counts of violating ethics rules, including charges that he improperly solicited millions of dollars from corporate officials and lobbyists for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at City College of New York, failed to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of income and assets on financial disclosure forms, maintained a rent-stabilized apartment as a campaign office in a Harlem apartment building and failed to pay income taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic. Rangel asked to and received permission to speak to colleagues after Pelosi finished her brief censure statement, the second time he had addressed them from the floor in the last few hours, and he once again took a defiant tack over the case. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Representative Charles B.

Article: New York: When the first plane struck 1 World Trade Center at 8:48 am on Tuesday, the people in 2 World Trade Center who saw the instant damage to the other tower realized clearly what they, too, must do: get out fast. Katherine Ilachinsiki, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Mrs Ilachinsiki, an architect working on the 91 floor of 2 World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, an executive , cried sharply and set off too. But others up and down the 110 floors, many without seeing the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off. Most people had no idea about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower asked people to , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower. Some left, others stayed. Some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other cautions to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay were killed completely when the second plane crashed into the south tower. One of those caught in indecision was the executive at Fuji Bank USA. Richard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79 floor with the other office workers, but on the 48 floor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up, two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor. \\"I just don't know what happened to them,\\" Mr Jacobs said. Question: Which floor was hit by the second plane? - The 91 - The 103 - The 60 - The 79 Answer:","response":"The article does not explicitly mention the specific floor hit by the second plane. However, it states that Richard Jacobs and others from Fuji Bank on the 79th floor went back up two minutes before the plane crashed into their floor.

Options: - bar - gentleman's lounge - kindergarten class - university - school The answer is \\"bar\\" because A:","response":"The use of a student ID card instead of a legal identification card or document, such as a driver's license or a passport, is generally not accepted for entry at places that have an age restriction such as a bar. This is due to the laws surrounding alcohol consumption and distribution, which often limit these activities to individuals of a certain age, typically 21 years of age in most states in the US. Student IDs typically do not contain explicit information regarding the student's date of birth, and even if they do, they are generally not considered legitimate forms of identification during age verification for situations involving alcohol for several reasons. First, there is the issue of authenticity. It is far more convenient, easy, and cost-effective to forge a student ID than it is to forge government-issued identification cards or documents. Thus, the risk of fraudulent representation and use is considerably higher. Secondly, there is the issue of legal penalties for posession or use of fraudulent identification. The penalties for falsifying government-issued identifications are generally much steeper than those for student IDs, thereby creating a more significant deterrent against fraudulent representation in situations involving alcohol. Lastly, bars, being private establishments, have full legal rights to determine and enforce their own policies regarding the form of acceptable identification for entry. The most common practice is to adhere strictly to government-issued identifications, primarily as a preventative measure against potential legal repercussions surrounding underage drinking. In contrast, a student ID would certainly grant a student access into other settings like their kindergarten class, university, or school, places where the purpose of needing ID is not to verify age, but to verify that the individual is indeed a student of the institution. For a gentleman's lounge, the specific ID requirements might vary, but given that these places might also serve alcohol, the requirement for a more universally accepted, government-issued ID presents itself again. Therefore, within the context of the question and considering these factors, the answer is \\"bar\\"."},{"question":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.telegram.messenger.

When he arrives in Diego-Suarez, he arouses the suspicions of the pirates, especially Captain Roc Brasiliano. Brasiliano orders him to appear before a tribunal of the Coast Captains to decide his fate. If they do not like him, he will be executed. Meanwhile, Hawke has caught the eye of Spitfire Stevens - the only woman among the Coast Captains - who inherited her position from her father. At the tribunal, Hawke duels one of the pirates with boarding pikes, managing to outfight him. Hawke is therefore allowed to join Brasiliano's crew to prove his worth. While cruising the shipping lanes, they come across a Moghul vessel crammed with luxuries and vast wealth. After a tough battle, it is taken and looted.

The name \\"Memorial Day\\" was first used in 1882, but it did not become the official holiday name until 1967. In 1968, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act was passed by Congress, which moved the celebration of Memorial Day from its traditional May 30th date to the last Monday in May, creating a three-day weekend for many Americans. On Memorial Day, it is common for people to visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries. A national moment of remembrance is also observed at 3:00 pm local time, when people are encouraged to pause for a minute of silence to remember the fallen."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Piece of junk... Review: Having to read this book as part of a club for discussion is the only reason I would even spend my time for reading this piece of rubbish. The author is obviously putting his own political leftist views into his view of the war. The author simply spews out outrageous claims with no factual data to back it up. I, being a centrist and not left/right leaning, found this book to be a biased attempt by a leftwing author to denegrate the accomplishments of the US in their attempts to solve problems in this complex world. Based on the authors views the US is responsible for the world's problems. Total BS coming from a guy who probably benefits from the global policies of the country he denounces so readily. The most amazing part of the book is that if he really believes the crap he writes he should get the heck out of here and move to an eastern block or middle eastern country.

Answer:","response":"The missing first step in the process you have described, which covers the formation of igneous and sedimentary rocks through crystallization, is the generation of molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle. This complex process can be outlined as follows: 1. Formation of Magma or Lava: Magma is formed through the process of melting within Earth's mantle and crust. This can occur due to various factors, such as increased temperature and pressure or the addition of water and other volatiles in the mantle rocks. In some cases, the melting of existing rocks can also generate magma. Typically, the mantle's composition consists of solid silicate minerals, which begin to melt when exposed to high temperatures and pressures or when they come into contact with hotter materials from the Earth's core. As the molten material rises, it forms magma chambers in the crust. When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is known as lava. This can occur during a volcanic eruption, where molten rock or lava is expelled from a vent or fissured area of Earth's crust. Lava can also be extruded quietly and slowly from volcanic fissures without any explosive activity. 2. Magma Crystallizes: As magma cools, minerals start to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is called crystallization, and the resulting rocks are classified as igneous rocks, particularly intrusive (or plutonic) rocks, as they form beneath the Earth's surface. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and gabbro. The rate at which the magma cools and the specific minerals present determine the size and texture of the resulting rock. 3. Lava Cools on the Surface: When lava reaches the Earth's surface and flows out of a volcanic vent or fissure, it starts to cool and solidify. This process is quicker than the crystallization of magma beneath the surface due to the exposure to ambient temperature and air. The cooling allows minerals to crystallize and form solid rock, developing into extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and andesite. 4. Lava Crystallizes: As lava cools, the minerals within it begin to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is similar to the crystallization of magma beneath the surface but occurs more rapidly. The resulting rocks are also classified as igneous rocks and are grouped as extrusive rocks since they form at or near the Earth's surface. 5. Minerals Dissolved in Water Crystallize: In addition to igneous rocks, crystals also form through the process of precipitation from water solutions. Over time, minerals dissolved in water can reach supersaturated levels, causing them to crystallize and form solid rock. This process, known as precipitation, contributes to the formation of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, evaporites, and chert. These rocks are composed of mineral grains deposited from a water-based solution, like lakes, oceans, or groundwater. In summary, the missing first step in the process you have outlined is the formation of the molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle through melting induced by factors like increased temperature, pressure, or the addition of water and other volatiles. This sets the stage for the series of steps that follow, leading to the crystallization of igneous and sedimentary rocks."},{"question":"Summarize this article: After Ms Wang died in 2007, Peter Chan, formerly known as Tony Chan, claimed he was the sole beneficiary of her estimated 4bn (Â£2.6bn) estate. The case of the eccentric billionaire widow and her alleged geomancer lover transfixed Hong Kong. A court ruled two years ago that her estate would go to charity. The BBC's Juliana Liu in Hong Kong reports that during the trial the jurors heard many lurid and colourful stories about the unlikely couple. They were told, for example, that Chan first wooed Nina Wang, who was then one of Asia's richest women, with a head massage. When sentencing Chan, Justice Andrew Macrae spoke of the \\"shameless and unparalleled greed\\" at the heart of a \\"well-executed and well-planned\\" crime, Reuters news agency reports. \\"Never once ... have you shown the slightest remorse for your conduct,\\" he is quoted as saying. Chan, who had pleaded not guilty on charges of forgery and using a forged document, was impassive during the sentencing, Reuters reports. The self-styled Feng Shui practitioner changed his name from Tony Chan to Peter Chan earlier this year after he converted to Christianity. Chan fought for years to inherit the property tycoon's multi-billion dollar fortune, claiming he was the sole beneficiary according to a 2006 will. But a court finally dismissed his claims to the inheritance in 2011, ruling in favour of a charity run by Ms Wang's siblings, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, whose claim to her estate rests on a will from 2002. Ms Wang, who was 69 when she passed away, was known for her pig-tails, short skirts and colourful dress sense. She was the widow of Hong Kong industrialist Teddy Wang, who disappeared in 1990 after being kidnapped.

I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body. The building was closed for around a day and a half they had to repaint and do all sorts of things because of so much blood. Ill say they do not train you for seeing such horrible things or even mention that it can happen I'm lucky enough to have a strong head and can handle seeing such horror. Of course Im not 100% OK from it and now keep a close eye on the bathrooms. But I'm OK enough to continue working and only saw a psychologist twice about it.

What is the solution?","response":"Step 1: Rearrange the equation to isolate p. The current equation is: 0 = 44*p - 166 - 186. But we need to find the variable 'p', hence we isolate p by bringing the constants to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to combine like terms on one side. The equation becomes: 44*p = 166 + 186 Step 2: Simplify the equation. To do this, we need to combine '166' and '186' to get '352', and the equation then becomes: 44*p = 352 Step 3: Divide each side by the coefficient of p, which is '44'. To do that, we get: p = 352/44 Step 4: Simplify the equation to get the final answer. By performing the division operation 352/44, we find that: p = 8. So, the solution to the problem 0 = 44*p - 166 - 186 is p = 8."},{"question":"Akorát… nemám rád cizí společnost.“ Could you please translate this to English?","response":"Step 1: Identify the language Before translating the text, it is important to identify the language the text is written in.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer organisms having mutations in the DNA of sex cells? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Maybe if there was more give or if there was a small piece of goring where the strap meets the shoe. Or maybe there was but it just wasn't enough, I'm not sure. A:","response":"This review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product, for several reasons: 1. The review title ('Eh') implies dissatisfaction and a lack of enthusiasm about the purchase. This title sets the tone for the rest of the review and indicates that the reviewer did not have an overall positive experience. 2. The reviewer highlights a potential design flaw: the strap on the shoe being uncomfortable. The fact that the strap is mentioned as causing discomfort, even for a person without a high instep, suggests that the design might not be suitable for a wider range of foot shapes and sizes. This could be a concern for potential buyers, as they might also experience discomfort after purchasing the shoes. 3. The reviewer had to send the product back due to discomfort. This not only demonstrates dissatisfaction but also implies that the inconvenience of having to return the product was greater than the potential benefits of keeping it. A potential buyer might consider this a drawback, as they may also have to go through the same hassle if they experience similar discomfort. 4. The.review also points out potential ways to improve the shoe's comfort (more give, small piece of goring), which indicates that the product may not be well-designed in its current state. A potential buyer could see these suggestions as an indication that there are better alternatives on the market with better design and features. 5. The reviewer ends on an uncertain note, stating they are \\"not sure\\" if the shoe had the suggested improvement or not. This lack of clarity might cause potential buyers to question the quality of the product or worry about making an uninformed purchase. They may opt to look for a product with clearer features and more consistent positive reviews.

The mortgage on the shoe is owned by the villainous Silas Barnaby (Henry Brandon), who is looking to marry Bo Peep. Knowing the Widow Peep is having a difficult time paying the mortgage, Barnaby offers the old woman an ultimatum â unless Bo Peep agrees to marry him he will foreclose on the shoe. Widow Peep refuses, but is worried about where she'll get the money to pay the mortgage. Ollie offers her all the money he has stored away in his savings can, only to learn that Stannie has taken it to buy peewees (a favored toy consisting of a wooden peg with tapered ends that rises in the air when struck with a stick near one end and is then caused to fly through the air by being struck again with the stick). He and Stannie set out to get the money for the mortgage from their boss, the Toymaker (William Burress). But Stannie has mixed up an order from Santa Claus (building 100 wooden soldiers at six feet tall, instead of 600 soldiers at one foot tall) and one of the soldiers, when activated, wrecks the toy shop. Stannie and Ollie are fired without getting the money. The two then hatch a plan to sneak into Barnaby's house and steal the mortgage, but are again foiled by their incompetence. Barnaby has them arrested on a burglary charge, and the two are sentenced to be dunked in the ducking stool and then banished to Bogeyland. But Barnaby agrees to drop the charges if Bo Peep will marry him. She reluctantly agrees, but not before Ollie suffers the dunking. Stannie and Ollie come up with a new scheme.

If you are asking about the first \\"form of government\\" in the United States, the answer would be the Continental Congress. If you meant to ask about the first \\"president\\" or \\"head of government,\\" the answer would be George Washington. Here's a more detailed explanation for each identification. 1) First Form of Government: The Continental Congress Before the United States became the organized nation that it is today, the Continental Congress was the principal governing body during the period of the American Revolution (1774-1789). The Continental Congress had two incarnations: the First Continental Congress (1774) and the Second Continental Congress (1775-1781). The First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, in response to the British Parliament's Coercive Acts, also known as the 'Intolerable Acts'. This initiating assembly of delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies addressed grievances they had with British rule and sought to establish a unified colonial resistance. The Second Continental Congress began its sessions on May 10, 1775, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The delegates from the thirteen colonies convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and effectively served as the country's national government during the conflict. This Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, and later established the Articles of Confederation, which served as the first constitution of the United States from 1781 until 1789. 2) First President of the United States: George Washington George Washington was the first president of the United States, serving from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797. Washington was elected unanimously by the Electoral College before serving two terms in office. He was a significant figure in the founding of the United States, initially gaining prominence as the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Upon winning the war, Washington was widely recognized as a critical figure in the creation of the United States Constitution, which established the blueprint for the country's new government. As the nation's first president, Washington was instrumental in forming the new government under the Constitution and setting precedents for future administrations. It is important to note the distinction between these two instances. The Continental Congress, in both its forms, was the first governing body of the United States during the Revolutionary period, whereas George Washington was the first president under the current United States federal government established by the Constitution."},{"question":"If \\"Two men in flaming accented shirts wrangling a large black cow.\\", does it logically follow that \\"the men are asleep in the motel\\"?","response":"Well, imagine there are two men wearing shirts with bright, fiery colors.

I think this is the detailed solution:","response":"To determine the amount James spends on coursework materials, we first need to find out how much money he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. 1. Food: James spends 30% of his budget on food. 30% of 1000 = (30/100) * 1000 = 300 2. Accommodation: James spends 15% of his budget on accommodation. 15% of 1000 = (15/100) * 1000 = 150 3. Entertainment: James spends 25% of his budget on entertainment. 25% of 1000 = (25/100) * 1000 = 250 Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment: 300 (food) + 150 (accommodation) + 250 (entertainment) = 700 Finally, to find out how much he spends on coursework materials, we subtract the total amount spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment from his total budget: 1000 (total budget) - 700 (spent on food, accommodation, entertainment) = 300 So, James spends 300 on coursework materials."},{"question":"Согласно ему, полицейский может выписать \\"ордер на задержание\\", который действует 48 часов.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump took Senate Republicans to task for failing to agree on how to dismantle Obamacare, as a new report showed 32 million Americans would lose health insurance if senators opt to repeal the law without a replacement. Trump gathered 49 Republican senators for a White House lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act collapsed on Monday amid dissent from a handful of the party’s conservatives and moderates. After Trump’s exhortation to keep trying, party members met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price behind closed doors on Wednesday night to try to finally come together on a major Republican promise of the past seven years - undoing former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare. There was no immediate breakthrough. “We still have some issues that divide us,” said Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Republicans attending the late meeting sent their staff away in order to talk frankly and Senator John Kennedy said everyone was negotiating in good faith but he added he did not know if they would reach agreement. Almost all the other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment. As it was getting underway, the nearly two dozen Republican senators were shaken by news that their colleague, veteran Senator John McCain, had been diagnosed with brain cancer. McCain’s absence from the Senate makes the job of passing a healthcare bill more difficult because leaders need every Republican vote they can get. “Obviously, I think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math. You understand the math. Obviously it makes things difficult,” Senator Bob Corker said as he left the meeting. Trump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail. Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare. “We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldn’t leave town until this is complete,” Trump said at the meeting. Trump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which he has called a “disaster,” a central promise of his 2016 campaign. Even with Trump’s new push, Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach. Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday, while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026. U.S. President Donald trump speaks during a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans to discuss healthcare at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque The CBO’s estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama. ‘TRUE DEATH SPIRAL’ Democrats were swift to highlight the CBO’s assessment, while Republicans remained silent. “President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage, yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite,” Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement. Insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal, saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs. “CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill. That’s a true death spiral,” tweeted Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. But the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnell’s plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years. All three attended the lunch with Trump. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans’ 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Slideshow (15 Images) Opponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon, leading to 155 arrests, police said. Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting. Party fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives. The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May. But on Wednesday, the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Party’s conservative wing, filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said: “The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action.” ||||| President Trump sat next to Sen.

(July 19) AP President Trump (Photo: Alex Brandon, Alex Brandon, AP) WASHINGTON — One day after President Trump declared he wanted to let the current health care law fail, he pressed Republican senators to agree to an alternative plan to replace Obamacare before taking any August recess. \\"I don't think we should leave town unless we have a health insurance plan,\\" Trump said during a White House lunch attended by 49 of the 52 Republican senators. \\"We shouldn't leave town until this is complete, until this bill is on my desk.\\" But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was already hedging about whether that's possible. He promised to hold a vote next week to debate a bill to simply repeal Obamacare – without a replacement – but it's not clear whether he even has the votes to do that. \\"It's pretty obvious we've had difficulty in getting 50 votes,\\" McConnell said. Related: The president also issued a warning to Republicans who want to delay taking action. \\"Any senator who votes against debate says you are fine with Obamacare,\\" he said. Trump made his demands while seated next to Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., who is considered vulnerable in next year's congressional elections and has opposed Republicans' health care plans. Trump backers have also threatened a primary challenge of Heller over his recalcitrance. In an apparent reference to the political minefield Heller is facing on health care, Trump said: \\"Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?\\" Two of the three GOP senators not in attendance – John McCain of Arizona and Johnny Isakson of Georgia – are recovering from surgery. The third missing senator, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said he couldn't attend because he was presiding over the Senate at lunch. The less-than-perfect attendance at the White House underscores the difficulties for Trump and Republicans, even though they control both chambers of Congress. McConnell has been unable to secure enough support to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is willing to repeal the law and hold a vote on it next week – but there are already three Republican senators who say they won’t vote to bring it to the floor. In making his plea to Republicans, Trump also tore into his critics, singling out Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York, who has said the GOP health care plan is a matter of life and death for Americans who might lose coverage. \\"He was saying death, everyone's going to die – Death! Death! Death!\\" Trump said. \\"That's the only thing they're good at.\\" The president also denounced predecessor Barack Obama as well as the health care law that bears his name, telling senators “Obamacare was a big lie,\\" and \\"it was a lie directly from the president.\\" Trump is making an aggressive push to achieve some kind of victory on health care, after several days of mixed messages. After GOP leaders announced Monday night they would pull a bill to \\"repeal and replace\\" the 2010 health care law signed by Obama, Trump said he was inclined to simply leave the current law in place, predicting it would \\"fail\\" and force Democrats to cooperate on a new plan. \\"We’re not going to own it – I’m not going to own it – I can tell you, the Republicans are not going to own it,\\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, \\"We’ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us, and they’re going to say, 'How do we fix it?'\\" Yet by Wednesday morning, Trump – who has sent conflicting signals throughout the health care debate over the course of the year – changed his tune, telling senators: \\"We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace ... I'll sign it.\\" Still, as he announced Wednesday's lunch meeting, Trump already appeared to be distancing himself from his party or the fate of the repeal and replace efforts, repeatedly referring to Republicans as \\"they\\" and the health care plan as \\"their\\" bill. Tweeting ahead of his lunch with the Senate Republicans, Trump said \\"they MUST keep their promise to America!\\" I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017 \\"The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime,\\" Trump said in another post. \\"The Dems scream death as OCare dies!\\" The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017 Trump campaigned on a pledge on a campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that does not cut Medicaid, covers \\"everybody,\\" and provides people with preexisting conditions similar coverage as current law. He cheered passage of a House plan – which passed by a narrow 217 to 213 margin – and even hosted a party in the White House to celebrate its passage in early May. The Congressional Budget Office said the House bill would lead to 23 million fewer people having health insurance by 2026 as compared to Obamacare. And the health care issued moved to the Senate, Trump declared the House bill too \\"mean,\\" and urged GOP senators to make changes. Now, Democrats are saying the Republicans should work with them, instead of Trump, given the president's recent comments. \\"Do they want to take the path of President Trump, who yesterday said he wanted our healthcare system to fail, or do they want to work with Democrats on legislation to improve the law?\\" said Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York. Trump held a similar White House meeting with the Senate Republican caucus last month. At that confab, the president sat between GOP senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – both of whom were in opposition to the Republican alternative to Obamacare. Republicans have had a variety of objections to a health care plan that had been pushed by McConnell. Some, including Collins and Murkowski, protested rollbacks in the Medicaid program. Some of the more conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, said the GOP plan did not go far enough in repealing Obamacare, particularly its tax provisions. It was a Monday night announcement by Lee and Republican Sen.

(But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.) Also, in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, \\"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Kuhn say must be the beginning phase of science?","response":"Thomas Kuhn's view on the beginning phase of science differs from that of Karl Popper. Kuhn believed that the beginning phase of science was not about criticizing myths, but rather about the establishment of a \\"paradigm,\\" which serves as a foundation for scientific inquiry. In Kuhn's seminal work, \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" (1962), he introduced the concept of a paradigm—a set of widely accepted theories, methods, and assumptions that constitute a framework within which scientists work. According to Kuhn, the beginning phase of science is when a scientific community adopts a paradigm that provides a shared way of understanding and conducting research on a specific problem or set of problems. The establishment of a dominant paradigm leads to a period of \\"normal science,\\" characterized by the reinforcement of the paradigm through puzzle-solving within its framework. As researchers continue to work within a paradigm, they may eventually discover anomalies or contradictions that cannot be explained by the existing theories. Over time, these anomalies may lead to a crisis that necessitates a revolutionary shift in scientific understanding, resulting in the emergence of a new paradigm. In summary, whereas Popper emphasized the critical discussion of myths and the falsification of theories as the starting point of science, Kuhn argued that the beginning phase of science was characterized by the establishment of a shared paradigm that guides scientific inquiry. This contrast highlights the different perspectives of the two philosophers on the nature of scientific progress and the process by which scientific knowledge is developed and transformed."},{"question":"Yapılan enerji anlaşmasına göre, Rus Gazprom Sırp NIS'yi satın alacak.

Options: - flush - razor - commercial area - city - water Hmmm, let me think.","response":"Joe might have had trouble with city zoning laws because his desired location for the barbershop was not in a commercial area where such businesses are usually allowed to operate. Zoning laws are established by local governments to designate the use of specific areas (zones) within a city, county, or other local jurisdiction. These zones regulate how land can be utilized and what types of businesses and residences can operate in those areas. In Joe's case, the neighborhood may have been zoned as a residential area, making it difficult for him to open a barbershop without obtaining a variance or rezoning approval. Often, commercial activities and businesses like barbershops are required to be in a commercial area to prevent potential conflicts with residents, noise, and traffic concerns."},{"question":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

(CN) - Missouri police Tasered a man repeatedly as he tried to enter a burning building to save his stepson, who died in the fire, the man and his wife claim in court. Ryan and Catherine Miller sued the City of Louisiana and landlord Louis Houston on March 12 in Pike County Circuit Court. The couple's 3-year-old son, Riley Rieser, died in the Oct. 31, 2013 fire. The Millers were able to escape from the home and Ryan Miller tried to go back in to save Riley. \\"Officers Jeffrey Salois and William Harrison prevented Ryan Miller from entering the home to save his stepson Riley Rieser by forcibly moving and by repeatedly Tasing Ryan Miller, including once in the police cruiser as Riley Rieser was being removed from the home,\\" the lawsuit states. The Millers say that Ryan never presented a threat to the officers or other emergency personnel, that Salois and Harrison never announced they were police officers and never placed Ryan Miller under arrest. \\"I was hysterical, yes, because I wanted to save my son,\\" Ryan Miller told the Louisiana Press Journal days after the fire. Riley was pronounced dead at a hospital. Ryan Miller told the Press Journal that he was placed in the holding cell while Riley was taken to the hospital. \\"He was my best friend,\\" Ryan Miller said told the Press Journal. \\"He was everybody's best friend. If you would have met him, you would have loved him. He was the joy of my life.\\" Ryan Miller says in the complaint that he was not charged with any crime. He claims that the repeated Tasing constitutes an unreasonable seizure and that officers \\"used more force than was reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\\" The fire was caused by faulty wiring, according to the complaint. The Millers claim that defendant Houston ignored repeated warnings from Louisiana housing officials and did not have an occupancy permit to lease the property because it had not been inspected for over two years. Due to Houston's negligence, the plaintiffs \\"were forced to expend monies for funeral and burial expenses\\" and \\"suffered burns, bruising, Tasing injuries\\" and other expenses,\\" the Millers say. They claim that Louisiana \\"failed to enforce its ordinances regarding obtaining occupancy permits for residences, and had knowledge that the home was occupied despite no occupancy permit being issued.\\" Attorney Keith Henson, representing Louisiana, told Courthouse News that the city had no comment. The Millers seek damages from Louisiana for excessive force, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death and false imprisonment. They seek punitive damages from Houston for wrongful death, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and negligent infliction of emotional distress. They are represented by Cole Combs of St. Charles, Mo. Louisiana, pop. 3,355, is a Mississippi River town 25 miles south of Hannibal. It is 88.5 percent Caucasian, has a median income of 27,559 (well below the Missouri average of 45,321) and has lost 13.2 percent of its population since 2000, according to city-data.com. ||||| Barefoot and dressed in his pajamas, Ryan Miller was ready to dive into the flames engulfing his home to save his 3-year-old stepson, but police in Louisiana, Mo. had other ideas. Miller and his wife, Cathy, awoke in the early-morning hours of Nov. 1 to a house filled with smoke. They were forced out through a back door, but their son, Riley, was still sleeping in his bedroom inside. Miller ran around the house and tried to enter through the front door, while Cathy placed a 9-1-1 call. Police responded to the scene within minutes, but instead of trying to help the couple save their child, one of the officers shot Miller with a stun gun. But the blast from the Taser failed to subdue the distraught dad, who kept trying to enter the burning building. So the cop hit him two more times with the stun gun. When Miller dropped to the ground, he was promptly handcuffed and put into the back of a patrol car, according to KHQA-TV. “He tried to get back in the house to get the baby. They took my son to jail because he tried to save his son,” the child’s grandmother, Lori Miller, told the TV station. The heat from the flames was reportedly so punishing, the police were forced to standby until firefighters arrived. State Fire Marshal Investigator Scott Stoneberger said a firefighter in full gear attempted to enter the home but the flames were too hot. Ryan Miller’s sister-in-law doesn’t think the police handled the situation correctly. “It’s just heartless. How could they be so heartless? And while they all just stood around and waited for the fire department, what kind of police officer wouldn’t try and save a 3-year-old burning in a house?” said Emily Miller. Firefighters later discovered the body of Riley Miller near the doorway to a bedroom. “We’ve been going through pictures and he’s just smiling in every picture. He was just a happy go-lucky kid,” said the boy’s aunt. The child’s parents were taken to Memorial Medical Center’s burn unit in Springfield, Ill. Ryan Miller suffered burns to his chest, and Cathy Miller burned the cornea in one of her eyes. Both were released from the hospital the same day. The house was destroyed. The fire marshal said an official cause of the fire has yet to be determined, although it does not appear to be suspicious. The investigation is expected to take several weeks. For those interested in helping the family, monetary donations may be sent to the Mercantile Bank in Louisiana, c/o Ryan Miller or the Riley Miller fund. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","response":"Ryan and Catherine Miller are suing the City of Louisiana and their landlord, Louis Houston, after their 3-year-old son, Riley Rieser, died in a house fire on October 31, 2013.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Deepak Tijori (born 28 August 1961) is an Indian film director and actor who works in Bollywood films and is well known for his supporting roles in \\"Aashiqui\\" (1990), \\"Khiladi\\" (1992), \\"Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar\\" (1992), \\"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa\\" (1993), \\"Anjaam\\" (1994), \\"Ghulam\\" (1998) and \\"Baadshah\\" (1999).

The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin.

The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall. The majority of these farms will have runoff from their crop soil flow into the river. The Cedar is located mostly inside an unpopulated forest. Currently, not much industrialization or settling by humans has happened near The Cedar. and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Please answer this question : Will the ocean water near The Minninnippi or The Cedar have less oxygen? Answer:","response":"The ocean water near The Minninnippi is more likely to have less oxygen as compared to the water near The Cedar, due to several factors such as agricultural runoff, livestock and human waste, and the potential for marine debris from the surrounding farmlands. The Minninnippi River flows through an area that is predominantly surrounded by farmlands. These agricultural lands often use fertilizers and chemicals to enhance crop production. When these substances come into contact with water through precipitation or irrigation, they can be carried away as runoff and make their way into the river. The presence of excess nutrients from these fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to eutrophication in the water bodies they flow into, including the ocean near the river's mouth. Eutrophication is the process through which an excessive amount of nutrients in the water leads to a rapid growth of aquatic plants and algal blooms. This, in turn, can decrease the dissolved oxygen levels in the water as the decomposition of the algae consumes oxygen. When oxygen levels become critically low, it results in hypoxia, which can lead to the creation of dead zones – areas where the oxygen concentration is too low to support most marine life. In addition to the runoff from fertilizers, the farm lands near The Minninnippi River may also contribute to the pollution of the river through livestock waste and human activities. The waste generated from these sources often contains various pollutants, including oxygen-depleting chemicals and harmful bacteria or pathogens, which contribute to further degradation of water quality. Contrastingly, The Cedar River is located mostly within an unpopulated forest, with little human or industrial interference. As a result, the river is less likely to be polluted by chemicals, waste, or debris associated with human activities. The absence of nutrient-rich runoff and pollution sources helps maintain the natural balance of dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean water near this river. To summarize, the ocean water near The Minninnippi River is expected to have less oxygen due to agricultural runoff, livestock and human waste, and the possible presence of marine debris resulting from the surrounding farmlands. On the other hand, The Cedar River, which is located in an untouched forest area, is less likely to be affected by pollution, thereby maintaining healthier oxygen levels in the adjacent ocean water."},{"question":"Thomas Pynchon was born in 1937 in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, one of three children of Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, Sr. (1907-1995) and Katherine Frances Bennett (1909-1996). His earliest American ancestor, William Pynchon, emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, then became the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1636, and thereafter a long line of Pynchon descendants found wealth and repute on American soil. Aspects of Pynchon's ancestry and family background have partially inspired his fiction writing, particularly in the Slothrop family histories related in the short story \\"The Secret Integration\\" (1964) and Gravity's Rainbow (1973). In an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis, with four novels in progress, announcing: \\"If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium.\\" In the mid-1960s, Pynchon lived at 217 33rd St. in Manhattan Beach, California, in a small downstairs apartment. In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from Stanley Edgar Hyman to teach literature at Bennington College, writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as \\"a moment of temporary insanity\\", but noted that he was \\"too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them.\\" Pynchon's second novel, The Crying of Lot 49, was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a \\"potboiler\\". When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it, \\"a short story, but with gland trouble\\", and hoped that Donadio could \\"unload it on some poor sucker.\\" The Crying of Lot 49 won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as \\"The Tristero\\" or \\"Trystero\\", a parody of a Jacobean revenge drama called The Courier's Tragedy, and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of World War II American GIs being used as charcoal cigarette filters. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like V., the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, with both books dwelling on the detritus of American society and culture. The Crying of Lot 49 also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of popular culture within his prose narratives. In particular, it incorporates a very direct allusion to the protagonist of Nabokov's Lolita within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of \\"The Paranoids\\", an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p. 17). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What other novels did he write?","response":"The article doesn't provide the names of any other specific novels that Thomas Pynchon wrote, apart from \\"The Crying of Lot 49.\\" It does mention that he was working on several novels at one point, but it doesn't give their names. It's kind of like saying you have some toys in your toy box, but not telling which ones they are."},{"question":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! and the situation: Two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere in class. They also started studying Venus' atmosphere.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] I am facing a new situation today: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? The answer is:","response":"Big Lake had fewer occurrences of divers drowning. This is because Arrow Lake had a river flowing into it, causing cold fresh water to float over the denser saline water, leading to temperature shock for divers.

Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart.

Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt.

It’s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.” Professor Brian Boyd No area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people. Most schools do not ‘partner’ with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we’ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?

NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like. The College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland’s top business people. In the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach?

He directs, produced and co-stars in this latest production. Not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap.

I have seen film clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film). Even though he uses plenty of old footage, he works them in well (and very creatively might I add). The film follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. he also corresponds with a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him to try and find this wannabe Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory? Is David Hess still the man? You'll have to find out for yourself and watch the Zodiac Killer. This film is NOT about the original Zodiac killer.

Recent research found that 40 percent of U.S.shoppers have showroomed previously, with big-box retailers suffering the most.Specifically, the study shows that Best Buy, Walmart and Target are the most likely brick-and-mortar stores to have shoppers test out a product in-store and then purchase it online later, while Amazon is benefiting most from the practice, with nearly 60 percent of shoppers using the online retail giant most often to make their showrooming purchases. Smartphones have pushed showrooming into the front.Shoppers no longer have to wait until they get home to see if they can find a cheaper price for the products they're considering buying.With smartphones, consumers can now compare virtual prices, at both other brick-and-mortar stores and online ones while still inside a retail store.If they can find what they're seeking for less online, the majority will be seeking the first exit.A recent study showed that 45 percent of customers shopping at brick-and-mortar stores walk out and buy their purchase online for a discount of as little as 2.5 percent.

Emily Davies. PUBLISHED:. 20:00 EST, 12 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 03:10 EST, 13 June 2013. With their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - National Trust venues seem like the perfect family day out. But the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes. In a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily-clad dancers will be held, after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country. The National trust has its eye on a different audience at the Killerton estate in Devon. Vintage: The National Trust hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd. The trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘buttoned-up’ impression to younger audiences. To reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image, a spokesman said performances would be ‘tasteful’ with dancers ‘showing off their corsets, feathers and pearls’. Organiser Shelley Barns told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It is a family event, so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame. ‘It is supposed to be a bit light-hearted. They won’t be getting completely naked, let’s put it that way. This is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this.’ Felicity Boucher, a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust, said: ‘We’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal.’ The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. One of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to National Trust properties across the country last year. Two models pose on a vintage car. The trust hopes to give off a less 'buttoned-up' impression of its properties. The first event will be held on June 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in Killerton, Devon, which is known for its collection of historical costumes. Performers will include Kitty’s Dolls Burlesque and singer Lola Lamour, with adult tickets costing £18.50. The second will be at at Trelissick Garden Cornwall, featuring The Slinky Minkys whose dancers include Babalicious, Miss Pip Tease and Miss Guilty Pleasure. Last year it was reported the organisation - of which Prince Charles is president — was launching an X-rated digital guide to London’s red-light district. It was a far cry from the Trust’s mantra ‘to preserve and protect historic places and spaces’. Former Tory Prisons Minister Ann Widdecombe, said she was appalled by the charitable body’s attempt to update its image. She said: ‘I fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of Soho relates in any way to the important and historic work of the National Trust.’ ‘In fact if this is the National Trust’s idea of attracting new members, I suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses.’ The National Trust events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation’s so-called ‘Disneyfication’ drive. This is where the organisation has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays. Highlights:","response":"1. National Trust venues aim to attract a younger audience by hosting burlesque nights at stately homes. 2. The decision follows a 4% decline in visitors across National Trust properties in the country last year. 3. Performances promise to be 'tasteful' and 'family-friendly', featuring corsets, feathers, and pearls. 4. The first event will be held at the Killerton estate in Devon, known for its collection of historical costumes, followed by Trelissick Garden in Cornwall. 5. Critics have expressed concern over the events, however, National Trust says it aims to change perceptions and present a less 'buttoned-up' impression."},{"question":"WCOO (105.5 FM) is a radio station broadcasting an adult album alternative format.

It is located in Lake Huron, at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac, between the state's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. The island was home to an Odawa settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century. It served a strategic position as a center on the commerce of the Great Lakes fur trade. Like many historic places in the Great Lakes region, Mackinac Island's name derives from a Native American language. Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle so they named it \\"Mitchimakinak\\" (Ojibwe: mishimikinaak) \\"Big Turtle\\". Andrew Blackbird, an official interpreter for the U.S. government and an Ottawa chief's son, said it was named after a tribe that had lived there. The French spelled it with their version of the original pronunciation: Michilimackinac. The British shortened it to the present name: \\"Mackinac.\\" Michillimackinac is also spelled as Mishinimakinago, Mishima'kinung, Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go, Missilimakinak, Teiodondoraghie. The Menominee traditionally lived in a large territory of 10 million acres extending from Wisconsin to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Historic references include one by Father Frederic Baraga, a Slovenian missionary priest in Michigan, who in his 1878 dictionary wrote: Mishinimakinago; pl.-g.--This name is given to some strange Indians (according to the sayings of the Otchipwes [Ojibwe]), who are rowing through the woods, and who are sometimes heard shooting, but never seen. And from this word, the name of the village of Mackinac, or Michillimackinac, is derived. Maehkaenah is the Menominee word for turtle. In his 1952 The Indian Tribes of North America, John Reed Swanton recorded under the \\"Wisconsin\\" section: \\"Menominee,\\" a band named \\"Misi'nimak Kimiko Wini'niwuk, 'Michilimackinac People,' near the old fort at Mackinac, Mich.\\" In an early written history of Mackinac Island (1887) by Andrew Blackbird, the Odawa historian, he describes that a small independent tribe called \\"Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go\\" once occupied Mackinac Island. They became confederated with the Ottawa from Ottawa Island (now Manitoulin Island) situated north of Lake Huron. One winter the Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go on Mackinac Island were almost entirely annihilated by the Seneca people from New York, who were part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Only two of the local natives escaped by hiding in one of the natural caves at the island. To commemorate the losses of this allied tribe, the Ottawa named what is now Mackinac Island, as \\"Mi-shi-ne-macki-nong.\\" In 1895 Fort Mackinac's John R. Bailey, M. D. published his history, entitled Mackinac formerly Michilimackinac, describing some of the first recorded presence on Mackinac of French traders. They arrived in 1654 with a large party of Huron and Ottawa heading to Three Rivers; another visitor was an adventurer making a canoe voyage in 1665.

In that situation, you could be sued for copyright infringement. For example, you could include this covenant: “Artist covenants that he/she has the sole right to record such original songs without any restrictions whatsoever. Artist further warrants that he/she has not entered into any written, oral, or other binding agreement of any kind prior to recording such songs on behalf of the record company.” By agreeing to this provision, the artist agrees not to sue you for any misunderstandings in the agreement. Obviously, including this provision won’t entirely prevent lawsuits. However, it can be helpful to have. You might write: “Artist agrees and warrants to hold the record company ‘completely and totally harmless’ from lawsuits, and litigation of any kind whatsoever, that might proceed from any misunderstandings spelled out or not spelled out in this agreement.” You can agree to arbitrate any disputes that arise under this contract. Arbitration is like a trial except it is private. You present your case to an arbitrator instead of a judge. Alternately, you could include a provision that you will mediate any dispute with the help of a mediator. “If a disagreement does arise, then the parties have agreed in this contract to seek binding arbitration for their differences outside the bounds of a lawsuit and before an arbitration panel made up of people within the music community who understand the legal aspects of each and every facet of this agreement.” Many young artists have stars in their eyes and imagine that fame and wealth are automatically guaranteed because they have signed a recording contract. You can include some provisions which explain to the artist that the music industry is risky. For example, you could have the artist promise to the following: “The artist covenants that he/she is not basing a decision to record on any intangible or fraudulent promises, dreams, or incentives given him/her by the producers, company, or management firm. It is the reality of the music business that the artist is taking a chance at recording and may or may not ever be signed to a major label in the future.” Also, you can have the artist warrant that no one is guaranteed success: “The artist understands and warrants that no one can guarantee ‘superstardom’ in the music industry. Only a small percentage of acts signed to the major labels go on to achieve superstardom.” For extra emphasis, you can set these provisions off in bold type.

Alain secretly imprisons Edmond in his dungeon for 20 years and convinces Blanche that her father is dead. Alain intends to further debase Blanche as revenge against Edmond. Alain tricks a high-born drunken cad, Denis de Beaulieu, in to believeing he has murdered a man. Denis escapes a mob by entering the Maletroit chateau by an exterior door which has no latch on the inside. Alain makes Denis a captive intending to force the delicate Blanche into marriage with him. Alain goes to the dungeon to torture Edmond with the news Blanche will be married to Denis, an unworthy rogue. After Alain leaves, Edmond asks the family servant Voltan to kill Denis before the wedding. However, Denis shows unanticipated redemptive qualities and he and Blanche fall in love. When Voltan comes to kill Denis, Blanche pleads with Voltan to spare his life and help him escape. Their attempts to escape are foiled by Alain, who then seals Edmond, Blanche and Denis in a stone cell and starts a waterwheel that presses the cell walls inward to crush them to death. Voltan fights Alain and gets the key to the dungeon and pushes Alain into the waterwheel, temporarily stopping the crushing walls. Wounded by the guards, Voltan struggles to the dungeon and, with his dying breath, gets the key to Denis just as the walls start moving in again. Denis, Blanche and her father escape the cell.

This story is most famously recounted in the 14th-century Middle English poem \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" The poem is a chivalric romance that delves into themes of knightly honor, moral values, and temptation. The following is a detailed account of the story and how Sir Gawain comes to face the Green Knight. The story of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is set in the court of the legendary King Arthur during a Christmas feast. As the Knights of the Round Table gather to celebrate, the festivities are suddenly interrupted by the appearance of an enigmatic figure known as the Green Knight. This otherworldly figure is described as being entirely green - not just his clothing, but even his hair, skin, and horse. He carries a large, green bough in one hand and a formidable, green axe in the other. Upon entering the banquet hall, the Green Knight issues a seemingly innocent challenge to the knights present: he will allow one of them to strike him on the condition that, in one year and one day, the knight who strikes him agrees to find the Green Knight and receive an equal blow in return. Although the challenge is initially met with hesitation, King Arthur himself steps forward to accept it. However, Sir Gawain, one of King Arthur's most loyal and gallant knights, intercepts the king, insisting that he be the one to undertake the challenge, as it is unbecoming for a king to partake in such a dangerous act. Arthur concedes, and Sir Gawain boldly takes the green axe and beheads the Green Knight with a single stroke. Rather than dying, the Green Knight merely picks up his severed head, reiterates his challenge, and, as promised, instructs Gawain to seek him out in one year and one day at a place called the Green Chapel, before disappearing. Over the next year, Sir Gawain prepares himself to fulfill his end of the bargain. As the appointed date approaches, he sets out on a perilous quest to find the Green Chapel and the Green Knight. Along his journey, he undergoes various trials and temptations, including an encounter with a mysterious lady named Lady Bertilak and her lord, whose castle becomes his place of shelter. Sir Gawain, committed to maintaining his knightly virtues, courageously resists the advances of Lady Bertilak, who repeatedly tests his loyalty during his stay at the castle. As a token of her affection and a symbol of protection, she eventually gives him a magical green girdle, which is said to grant its wearer invincibility. When the day of reckoning finally arrives, Sir Gawain reaches the Green Chapel and bravely faces the Green Knight, ready to receive the fateful blow. However, the Green Knight reveals the entire challenge to be a test of Gawain's honor and chivalry, orchestrated by the wizard Merlin. It is unveiled that the Green Knight is, in fact, the lord of the castle where Gawain had stayed, and Lady Bertilak is his wife. Despite Gawain's adherence to his knightly virtues, the Green Knight points out his only failure – keeping the green girdle a secret and prioritizing his self-preservation over complete honesty. Forgiving him for this momentary lapse, the Green Knight allows Gawain to return to Arthur's court with the knowledge of the whole ordeal, reminding him of his commitment to chivalry and honor. Gawain returns to Camelot, humbled and with newfound wisdom, where he is celebrated by his fellow knights who take the lesson to heart as well. In summary, Sir Gawain accepts the challenge from the Green Knight in the famous Arthurian legend. Gawain's bravery, loyalty, and commitment to his word exemplify the grandeur and chivalric principles of the Knights of the Round Table. This tale has become an enduring piece of literature that continues to inspire discussions about morality, knighthood, and the human condition."},{"question":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Cotto, priceRange = moderate, area = city centre, near = All Bar One.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In May 1985, Gorbachev delivered a speech in Leningrad advocating reforms and an anti-alcohol campaign to tackle widespread alcoholism. Prices on vodka, wine, and beer were raised in order to make these drinks more expensive and a disincentive to consumers, and the introduction of rationing. Unlike most forms of rationing intended to conserve scarce goods, this was done to restrict sales with the overt goal of curtailing drunkenness. Gorbachev's plan also included billboards promoting sobriety, increased penalties for public drunkenness, and to censor drinking scenes from old movies. Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.\\"?","response":"Question: What were the main strategies and outcomes of Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign in 1985, and how did it affect the Russian economy and public health?

The first step, then, is to find a suitable location. The Buddha recommended three: the forest, the foot of a tree, or an isolated or empty spot. Silence is essential to Anapanasati, especially for beginners. For you, a quiet room might be best. A secluded woods or beach might also work well. Silence will help you to develop concentration. If you cannot find complete silence, aim for somewhere that is quiet and private. People can meditate in several different postures, like standing, reclining, sitting, and walking. Sitting is the best for Anapanasati. Ideally, you should take a cross-legged position with both feet turned up and resting on your thighs, i.e. the lotus position. Don’t worry if you can’t take the lotus position. It is also acceptable to sit half cross-legged, with one leg slightly bent. You should also sit erect. Your torso should be upright but not tense or rigid. Imagine that all the bones in your spine are linked together. As for your hands, they should lay gently on your lap. Like in Vipassana, the right hand is traditionally atop the left with the palms up. Your eyes can be closed, half-closed, or open – whichever is most comfortable – and your head should be tilted downward, your nose perpendicular to the navel. The focus of your mindfulness in Anapanasati will again be breathing. Turn your mind toward the rising and falling, the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. Follow the sensations involved and be aware of them. Be especially mindful of the place when the breath enters and leaves your nostrils. This will be a spot just under your nose or above your upper lip. Center on the spot where the breath touches the skin. Be aware: when you breathe in, recognize that you’re breathing in. Likewise when you are breathing out. However, don’t try to control or hold back your breathing. As your awareness of breathing increases, it will become less willful. ” There are eight graduated steps in Anapanasati meditation, each one working up to nirvana. The basic and most rudimentary level is “counting.” Counting is intended for those with no background in the technique. People with experience in meditation may not need it and can begin with the second level. Fix your attention on the tip of your nose, as said. Now, count the movements of your breath. For example, you might count the first inhalation as “one, one” and the first exhalation as “two, two.” Continue to the tenth breath (“ten, ten”) before returning to “one, one.” If you lose track, start again at “one, one.” The counting itself is not meditation. It instead helps to calm the wandering mind, by making you aware when you become distracted and lose the count. In Anapanasati there are eight total steps. To get further in the technique, you will slowly be able to move into higher levels. “Following” comes next. Once you have calmed your mind with counting, you should be able to mentally track or “follow” the course of your breath without keeping track. Following just means to follow the breath with the mind. You do not deliberately breathe in or out, but only remain aware that it takes place. Try to see the beginning, the middle, and the end of each cycle of breaths. This practice is called \\"experiencing the whole body.\\" “Contact” and “Fixing” come next. These both require stronger concentration and are harder to attain. People who reach this level may feel they have stopped breathing altogether, because they are so calm that it’s hard to feel the action of the breath. They must keep focused on the spot under the nostrils. Many report calm, joy, or even powerful visions. Very few people make it to the upper steps of the technique. “Observing,” “turning away,” “purification,” and “retrospection” will take you to higher paths of self-awareness. If you want to achieve these higher grades, you will most likely need to find a spiritual master to guide you. Consider attending a meditation retreat – monasteries and other centers around the world host such retreats, in many cases as a free service to the community.

Jurors deliberated less than three hours in the civil lawsuit filed by 27 victims and family members. “I’m gravely disappointed in the outcome,” said plaintiff’s attorney Marc Bern. “Unfortunately, the victims of this tragedy… have been dealt another blow.” Bern said Cinemark was negligent in providing for the safety of its patrons. He said the company should have had cameras outside the theater, a silent alarm on the back door and armed guards. He noted that Cinemark used armed guards at that theater on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. “But for a special event, expecting a thousand people for the premier of a blockbuster move, they did not have that type of security,” he said. Cinemark’s attorney, Kevin Taylor, said jurors could see that the mass shooting, committed by James Holmes, was “unstoppable, unforeseeable, unpreventable and unpredictable.” “The evidence is that by mid-June, Mr. Holmes was very fully committed,” Taylor said. “In between mid-June and when he committed this act, he completely booby-trapped his apartment in ways that were heretofore unforeseen, and never experienced before by law enforcement that investigated the Oklahoma City bombing and that investigated the Unibomber.” Taylor told Denver7 that jurors determined that Cinemark endured a tremendous tragedy, “as did the victims of this case, the entire Aurora community and first responders at the hands of a madman.\\" “Justice was done, in our view, 11 and a half months ago when Mr. Holmes was found solely at fault for this horrendous, horrendous crime, that I hope our state and our nation never again endures,” he said. Bern said he believes there were significant issues and substantial areas where an appeal will very likely reverse this decision. “We fully expect to try this case again,” he said. “I believe these victims were denied justice.” When asked what evidence was excluded from the civil trial, Bern wouldn’t elaborate. “We’ll wait until we review the transcript before outlining what evidence should be included in the appeal,” he said. Bern said he hopes there have been changes in security regardless of the outcome of this case. “Just today,” he said, “they’re talking about another plane that went down (Egypt Air) and are speculating that it might have been the result of some kind of terrorist act. We have to be on constant lookout, constant vigil, whether it’s at the airport, the theater or wherever. We are living in a post 9/11 world and we must understand that. We can’t act like it’s 1950.” Taylor said Cinemark is a company that first and foremost cares deeply about all of its patrons and has a very special place in its corporate heart. “I think you saw that from the employees who testified for all the victims of this [tragedy] including the people who were killed and injured in auditorium number nine.” ||||| Victims of the theater shooting filed suit against Cinemark alleging that security was lax In this Wednesday, May 11, 2016 file photo, a colorful sign decorates the entrance of the Cinemark Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colo. ( Brennan Linsley, The Associated Press ) CENTENNIAL — The owner of the Aurora movie theater where 12 people were murdered in one of the nation's worst mass shootings is not to blame for the attack, a jury decided Thursday. The decision is the first in a trial against theater chain Cinemark stemming from the 2012 shooting, which also wounded 70 people. It means that Cinemark will not have to pay money to any of the survivors of the shooting or relatives of those killed in it who filed suit against the company in state court. The victims argued Cinemark's security failings helped enable the attack. A separate case against the theater filed in federal court is scheduled for trial in July. \\"The community has spoken,\\" Cinemark attorney Kevin Taylor said after the verdict was announced. \\"Its conscience has been heard.\\" The jury of five men and one woman deliberated for about four hours before reaching the decision. The verdict was read in the same Arapahoe County courtroom where the fate of the gunman was decided less than a year ago, but it lacked the same emotion. Advertisement None of the shooting's victims were in court when the decision was announced. Instead, as this latest ripple of the shooting crested and fell, the audience consisted mostly of people paid to be there. Outside the courtroom, the victims' attorney, Marc Bern, sighed heavily and vowed a quick appeal. \\"This is an unjust verdict,\\" he said. After the shooting, approximately 60 survivors of the attack and families of those killed filed lawsuits in state and federal courts against Cinemark. Those lawsuits eventually were consolidated into two cases — one in state court and one in federal court. Among other things, the victims argued that Cinemark should have had armed guards at the Century Aurora 16 theater the night of the shooting, when 1,000 people were expected to attend the midnight premiere of the Batman film \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" The plaintiffs in the state case include three parents whose children were murdered in the shooting, a man who now walks with a permanent limp and a woman who had to hold her own intestines in to survive. Because of how the trial was structured, though, none of them testified during the case. Instead, the jury was asked only to assess whether Cinemark should have known about the risk of a mass shooting and whether the theater had failed to protect patrons. If Cinemark had been found liable, the victims could have testified about their injuries and medical expenses before a separate jury tasked with assigning monetary amounts to their suffering. Bern said that structure may have hurt his clients' case. But he said his appeal, which could lead to a new trial if successful, will focus on other types of excluded evidence. The judge, for instance, did not allow Bern to tell jurors about a U.S. Department of Homeland Security memo released two months before the shooting that warned movie theaters could be targets for terrorist attacks. Bern has said that memo should have put Cinemark on notice to improve its security. The theater company spent more than 500,000 on five expert witnesses who testified in its defense during the trial, according to testimony. The plaintiffs called one expert witness in their case, who had been paid about 22,000. \\"Unfortunately,\\" Bern said about his clients, \\"I think they are going to have to wait some period of time before they get justice.\\" Taylor, though, said justice was done last August, when the gunman was sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole plus another 3,318 years — one of the longest prison sentences in American history. That killer, he said after the verdict Thursday, was \\"completely unpredictable, unforeseeable, unpreventable and unstoppable.\\" To put blame on Cinemark would have unjustly extended liability to businesses across the country for things they could not possibly predict, he said. \\"The inescapable conclusion,\\" Taylor said, \\"was that this was a horrible tragedy.\\" John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or @johningold ||||| Summary:","response":"Cinemark Theaters has been cleared of liability for the 2012 mass shooting during a special movie premier in Aurora, Colorado, which left 12 people dead and 70 others injured.

Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews. In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with Ron Rifkin, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded All My Sons as \\"a very depressing play in a time of great optimism\\" and that positive reviews from Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times had saved it from failure. In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times. In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All My Sons. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred. did he produce another play?","response":"Yes, Arthur Miller continued to produce plays after Death of a Salesman. Some of his notable works include The Crucible (1953), which is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the Salem witch trials, and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956), a tragedy set in an Italian-American community in Brooklyn.

Clarke's novel \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" is considered one of the most influential science-fiction films ever made and is known for its pioneering special effects, depiction of space travel, and enigmatic narrative structure. The Discovery One is a fictional spaceship that plays a central role in both the film and the novel. Designed for a manned mission to Jupiter, the spacecraft is operated by a computer system called HAL 9000, which is described as a \\"Hibernation-Enabled Logic/Heuristic-Algorithm 9000 Series.\\" HAL 9000 is famous for its distinctive red eye-like camera lens and for its increasing malfunction throughout the film, ultimately leading to a series of tragic events. The spacecraft's design is characterized by a long, slender structure with rotating sections that provide artificial gravity for the crew members. The Discovery One also features modular pod units, which are used for maintenance tasks and can be piloted independently. The front of the craft houses the crew's living quarters, while the large spherical section at the rear contains the powerful engines that propel the spacecraft on its journey through the solar system. In addition to the Discovery One, the film also showcases other spaceships and their role in human exploration of space. The Orion III Spaceplane, for instance, serves as a commercial passenger shuttle between Earth and an orbiting space station, and the American Aries 1B Moon Lander transports the film's protagonist, Dr. Heywood R. Floyd, from the orbiting space station to a lunar base. \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" remains a seminal work in the science-fiction genre. Its depiction of space travel, futuristic technology, and extraterrestrial intelligence have influenced many subsequent films, novels, and TV shows. The spacecraft Discovery One, along with its captivating and terrifying computer companion HAL 9000, stands as an iconic symbol of humanity's ventures into the unknown realms of outer space."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Is rosin an example of wood extractives or insects? Context: Aside from the lignocellulose, wood consists of a variety of low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives. The wood extractives are fatty acids, resin acids, waxes and terpenes. For example, rosin is exuded by conifers as protection from insects. The extraction of these organic materials from wood provides tall oil, turpentine, and rosin. The answer to this question is:","response":"Rosin is an example of wood extractives. It falls under the category of low molecular weight organic compounds found in wood, specifically within the group of resin acids. Although rosin is exuded by conifers as a form of protection against insects, it is not an insect itself.

Options: - park - symphony - orchestra - music shop - musical instrument store Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"First, let's analyze each option to see where someone is most likely to watch a flute performance: 1. Park: While it's possible to encounter a flute player in a park, it is not guaranteed and it's not a specific location intended for flute performances. 2. Symphony: A symphony is a large-scale musical composition, usually performed by an orchestra. Flutes are common instruments in a symphony orchestra, so this is a good option to watch a flute. 3. Orchestra: An orchestra consists of a group of musicians playing a variety of instruments, including flutes. This is also a good option for watching a flute player. 4. Music shop: Music shops may sell flutes and occasionally offer live demonstrations, but these instances can be rare and are not focused specifically on flute performances. 5. Musical instrument store: Similar to a music shop, a musical instrument store sells instruments like flutes, but may not necessarily host live performances. Based on this analysis, the best options for watching a flute are attending a symphony or an orchestra performance, as both of these typically include flutists as part of the ensemble."},{"question":"How might one describe the sentiment of this review?

A:","response":"Guru Dutt, born Vasanth Kumar Shivashankarpe on July 9, 1925, was a multifaceted Indian artist known for his contribution to the Indian film industry as an actor, producer, director, and choreographer. He took birth in Bangalore, British India, in a culturally rich family that played a significant role in shaping his love for arts. Dutt kickstarted his career in the Indian film industry in 1944 when he was just 19 years old. Over a span of two decades, he worked with immense dedication and showcased his expertise in a variety of roles across the cinematic world. With his unique artistic prowess, Dutt made a significant impact on Indian cinema, particularly during its golden era. Guru Dutt's directorial ventures were well-known for their artistic sensibilities, strong storylines, and a distinct visual style that set them apart from other films of that era. His movies, such as “Pyaasa” (1957) and “Kaagaz Ke Phool” (1959), are still considered classics that greatly influenced subsequent generations of filmmakers. Apart from being a filmmaker, Guru Dutt was also a talented actor who captivated audiences with his powerful performances. He remained deeply committed to his craft, earning critical acclaim and widespread admiration for his work in films like “Baazi” (1951) and “Jaal” (1952). In his personal life, Guru Dutt was married to playback singer and actress Geeta Dutt (née Roy) from 1953 until his untimely death in 1964. The couple had three children together. Geeta Dutt, an accomplished artist in her own right, lent her voice to many iconic songs in Hindi cinema, further elevating their status as a power couple of that time. Unfortunately, Guru Dutt's life was marred by personal struggles and a tragic end. He passed away on October 10, 1964, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, under mysterious circumstances. Despite his relatively short-lived career, Guru Dutt's extraordinary body of work has left an indelible mark on Indian cinema. Today, Guru Dutt is celebrated as one of the most influential and iconic figures in the history of Indian cinema. With a career that spanned 20 years, he contributed massively to the evolution of Indian films, inspiring future generations of filmmakers to push the boundaries of storytelling and explore new avenues in the world of cinema. His legacy continues to be revered by film enthusiasts, critics, and artists around the globe."},{"question":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Nitrogen is a diatomic element with five valence electrons.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed. It was white, too, but coarser than the medicine. She was very careful in tasting it, and she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket.

Furthering their education allows them to accomplish these goals. The other choices listed may be related to their experiences or interests as they pursue their education, but these activities do not encompass the main goal of being a student. 1. Study philosophy - While studying philosophy may be an interest or a part of their academic pursuits, it does not represent the overall objective of students as a whole. Philosophy is only one of the many subjects students can choose to study. 2. Become adult - Naturally, students grow older and transition to adulthood during their educational journey. However, the essential purpose of being a student is to obtain knowledge and develop skills, not simply to age or \\"become an adult.\\" 3. Ask questions - Being inquisitive and asking questions is an essential aspect of learning, but it is a means through which students further their education and understanding rather than an end-goal. 4.

Over the years, Danjaq and EON Productions have successfully produced numerous Bond films, making it one of the longest-running and most successful film franchises in history. Regarding the organization SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion), it is a fictional global criminal syndicate originally created by Ian Fleming for his James Bond novels. SPECTRE, under the leadership of its arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, functioned as a central antagonist in the storylines involving James Bond.

At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery and a supplemental food fishery. However, the wild Atlantic salmon fishery is commercially dead; after extensive habitat damage and overfishing, wild fish make up only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in world fish markets. The rest are farmed, predominantly from aquaculture in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia. Sport fishing communities, mainly from Iceland and Scandinavia, have joined in the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy away commercial quotas in an effort to save the wild species of Salmo salar. is there such a thing as wild atlantic salmon?","response":"Yes, wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) do exist, but they are far less common than they once were due to factors such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and environmental changes. As you mentioned in your given information, wild Atlantic salmon comprises only 0.5% of the Atlantic salmon available in the world fish markets, with the vast majority of the remaining 95.5% being farmed through aquaculture. Wild Atlantic salmon are native to the rivers of the North Atlantic, including those in Eastern North America, Europe, and Russia. They are anadromous, meaning they hatch in freshwater and then migrate to the ocean, where they mature before returning to freshwater environments to spawn. During these annual spawning runs, wild Atlantic salmon are targeted by recreational anglers, particularly fly fishers. Concerns regarding the sustainability of wild Atlantic salmon populations have been growing for many years. The decline in their numbers is due to a combination of factors such as overfishing, degradation of spawning and rearing habitats, pollution, introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Dams also pose a significant threat to migration routes, preventing salmon from reaching their spawning grounds, and impeding the genetic exchange between populations. Conservation groups and sport fishing communities have taken various actions to conserve and restore wild Atlantic salmon populations. One such effort is the establishment of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund (NASF), which aims to buy out commercial fishing quotas in order to save the wild species of Salmo salar. This initiative is supported by sport fishing communities predominantly from Iceland and Scandinavia, as they recognize the ecological and cultural value of wild Atlantic salmon. Restoration efforts include improving water quality, altering or removing obstructions such as dams to provide access to critical habitats, and working with communities and policymakers to reduce impacts from land development. In some regions, hatchery programs have been implemented to supplement depleted wild stocks and re-establish populations in rivers where they were historically abundant. In conclusion, there is such a thing as wild Atlantic salmon, but it is becoming increasingly rare due to multiple factors impacting their populations. Conservation and restoration efforts are ongoing to ensure the survival of this ecologically and culturally valuable species. However, much of the Atlantic salmon available to consumers today is sourced from aquaculture, as the size of the wild population cannot support large scale commercial fishing."},{"question":"Context: Rookie cornerback Jason Verrett intercepted Oakland Raiders rookie quarterback Derek Carr at the San Diego 5 with 1:13 remaining in the game to seal a 31-28 Chargers win on the road.

Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat.

Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak. The Chargers defense forced a three-and-out, when Allen&#8212;filling in for an injured Royal&#8212;returned the punt 29 yards to the Oakland 39. With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating. Verrett grew up a Raiders fan in nearby Fairfield, California. About 100 of his friends and family attended the game, including his brother, who works for the Raiders.

Folic acid plays a crucial role in preventing neural tube defects, which are abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord that can occur in the early stages of fetal development. It also aids in the proper formation of the baby's neural system, supports cell division and DNA synthesis, and contributes to the healthy growth and overall well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Folic acid requirements may vary for different individuals within the same stage of pregnancy, depending on their personal health, overall diet, and other factors. However, there are general guidelines provided by health organizations and experts that recommend the appropriate intake amount to ensure sufficient nutrients are provided during pregnancy. The recommended daily intake of folic acid for pregnant women is typically 600 to 800 micrograms (mcg) per day, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine and other international health authorities. This amount should ideally be consumed through a combination of dietary sources and supplements. It is important to note that pregnant women with a history of neural tube defects or other high-risk factors may require higher doses, as prescribed by their healthcare provider. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations recommend that women of childbearing age and those planning for pregnancy should consume 400 mcg of folic acid daily to ensure optimal levels are maintained before conception. In conclusion, the question is seeking information on the optimal daily intake of folic acid for pregnant women to promote the healthy development of the fetus and maintain the mother's well-being. Daily recommendations typically range from 600 to 800 micrograms and may vary based on individual needs and risk factors. It is essential to follow the guidance of healthcare providers and maintain a balanced diet to provide both the mother and the baby with the necessary nutrients throughout pregnancy."},{"question":"In an interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio, Sean discussed the role Kanye West and No I.D. have had in the development of his first studio album's sonic direction as well as the challenges of being inside the studio with West.

Answer this question \\"What year was it released\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"The year it was released is 2011."},{"question":"Translate \\"Mystic Inn is just one click away!\\" to Spanish.","response":"\\"Mystic Inn está a solo un clic de distancia!\\" As an AI language model, I am happy to give more details about the translation and some insights into the Spanish language. In this translation, \\"Mystic Inn\\" remains the same because it is a proper noun referring to the name of a place. Proper nouns generally do not need to be translated since they are unique identifiers of people, places, or objects. The phrase \\"is just one click away\\" has been translated to \\"está a solo un clic de distancia.\\" Here's the word-by-word breakdown of the translation: - \\"está\\": comes from the verb \\"estar\\" which means \\"to be.\\" In this context, it reflects a temporary situation or location. - \\"a\\": is a preposition that in this context could be translated as \\"at\\" or \\"to\\" (indicating distance, position or relationship). - \\"solo\\": means \\"just\\" or \\"only\\" and is modifying the following word \\"un\\" to emphasize that it's only one click. - \\"un\\": is the masculine indefinite article meaning \\"a\\" or \\"an.\\" It's used here because \\"clic\\" is a masculine noun in Spanish. - \\"clic\\": is the direct translation of \\"click\\" in English. It could be alternatively written as \\"click\\" too, but \\"clic\\" is the most common form. Similar to English, it's used to express the action performed when pressing a mouse button or tapping a hyperlink, for instance. - \\"de\\": is another preposition that generally means \\"of\\" or \\"from,\\" in this case, it is used to connect \\"clic\\" with the following word \\"distancia.\\" - \\"distancia\\": is the direct translation of \\"distance\\" in English. The translated phrase \\"Mystic Inn está a solo un clic de distancia!\\" conveys the idea that accessing Mystic Inn is a simple and easy action, just requiring a click. This phrase could be used in an advertisement, on a website, or in any other context where you'd like to inform Spanish-speaking users that they can easily access Mystic Inn online.

Are the following two questions the same? How do I export vegetables to abroad? How do I export vegetables? Select from the following. [i] no. [ii] yes. The answer is:","response":"The answer is [ii] yes. Although at first glance, these two questions may appear to be slightly different, they are essentially the same question. Both are inquiring about the process of exporting vegetables. While the phrase \\"to abroad\\" is included in the first question, it is redundant information, since exporting, by definition, implies sending products or services to another country. In both cases, the person asking the question is looking for information on how to export vegetables, which would involve understanding the requirements, regulations, and procedures related to international trade. Whether the question explicitly specifies \\"to abroad\\" or not, the fundamental inquiry remains the same. To answer the question of how to export vegetables, one would need to consider the following steps and factors: 1. Research the target market: Determine which countries have a demand for the type of vegetables you plan to export. Investigate the local market, consumer preferences, and potential competition. 2. Familiarize yourself with trade regulations and requirements: Each country has its own set of import and export regulations. Understand the applicable rules, quotas, tariffs, and any restrictions that may be in place for exporting vegetables. 3. Ensure product quality and compliance: It is essential to meet the quality standards and requirements for your target market. Adhering to food safety regulations, obtaining necessary certifications, and packaging your products properly will help ensure compliance. 4. Establish a reliable supply chain: Find trustworthy partners, like growers, packers, and freight forwarders, who can help you ensure a smooth export process. 5. Manage logistics and transportation: Determine the most efficient way to transport your vegetables while maintaining their quality and freshness. Consider factors like cost, transportation time, and necessary cold chain facilities. 6. Build relationships with buyers and distributors: Identify potential buyers and distributors in your target market. Establishing a strong network will help you successfully sell your vegetables in foreign markets. 7. Create a marketing strategy: Develop a solid marketing plan that communicates the benefits and quality of your products. This may include creating a brand identity, attending trade shows, and utilizing online platforms to connect with potential customers. 8. Prepare necessary documentation: Exporting requires various documents, such as invoices, packing lists, and shipping instructions. Ensuring that all required paperwork is in order will help prevent shipping delays or complications. In conclusion, the two questions are the same, as both ask for information on how to export vegetables. Exporting inherently implies sending products to another country, making the phrase \\"to abroad\\" unnecessary. The answer provided outlines the steps and factors to consider when exporting vegetables."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"Two old men sit in a hot tub.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"They are out at a restaurant.\\" is true?

Most puzzling are his last moments: clutching a snowglobe, he mutters the word \\"rosebud.\\" Kane, whose life was news and whose newspapers not only reported but formed public opinion, was central to his time, a larger-than-life figure.

The reporter sees Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the tycoon's ex-wife; she's drunk and won't speak to him. Then he reads the unpublished memoirs of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris), Kane's early financial adviser and childhood guardian, who later became a prime target of the Kane newspapers' trust-busting attacks. In one of many flashbacks, the Thatcher memoir shows Kane's mother signing guardianship of the boy and his fortune over to Thatcher, despite his father's objections.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Article: Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said,\\"You may go to prison,or you may go to Camp Green Lake.\\"Stanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before. So, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence,which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is. Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a place that has no lake and nothing green. Nor is it a camp,at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is only a desert wasteland,dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp. At Camp Green Lake,the warden makes the boys\\" build character\\" by spending all day, every day, digging holes:five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is searching for something,and before long Stanley begins his own search--for the truth. Fate is to find a solution to it all--the family curse,the mystery of the holes. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations,but now it is about to reveal its verdict .

Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000...

It seems that this sentence is discussing the need to stop new loopholes, or avenues for circumventing a rule or law, from appearing. The specific context in which it was used might help in understanding what the sentence pertains to. The term \\"loopholes\\" is often related to legal, financial, or security matters. For instance, in legal and financial contexts, loopholes refer to gaps or ambiguities in laws and regulations that allow individuals or entities to avoid conforming to the intent of the legislation without technically breaking the law. In security, loopholes might refer to vulnerabilities in systems that can be exploited. The sentence's beginning, \\"However,\\" suggests that it might be a part of an argument or discussion expressing the need to ensure that rules, laws, or systems are thorough, adequate, and loophole-free to uphold fairness, security, or integrity. The prevention of new loopholes' emergence could involve regular reviews and updates of policies and regulations, setting up oversight mechanisms to identify and close loopholes, and collaborating with experts in the field to anticipate possible loopholes. Maintaining a whistleblower system might also assist in identifying unnoticed loopholes. Preventing loopholes is vital across industries. In legal or financial systems, loopholes might enable tax evasion, regulatory avoidance, or unlawful behaviors. In computer systems, they could lead to security breaches. Hence, identifying and addressing loopholes is a priority for maintaining the integrity of systems and ensuring fair, legal, and secure operations."},{"question":"Information: - Ben Macintyre ( born 1963 ) is a British author , historian , reviewer and columnist writing for The Times newspaper .

Abigail Hernandez went missing on October 9 last year as she walked home from school just days before her 15th birthday. Police believe the man in the sketch may have driven the schoolgirl away in a blue pick up truck. She was safely reunited with her family Sunday. Safe: Abigail Hernandez has been reunited with her family nine months after she disappeared on her way home from school. Wanted: Police have released a sketch of a man suspected of driving away with the then 14-year-old Abigail. Based on information provided by Abigail, police say they are looking for a slightly overweight man with darkish skin, brown eyes, and stubble. He was described as being slightly taller than the 5ft 4in teenager. Few details have been released about Abigail's disappearance and where she has been for the past nine months. The only contact she had with her family was a letter believed to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her parents in the weeks after her disappearance. Although it didn't provide details on what had happened to her, the letter gave parents Zenya and Ruben Hernandez some hope that Abigail was at least still alive. Police are investigating whether the man in the sketch, or anyone else, was involved in the disappearance, and whether Abigail was taken against her will, or enticed away, and where she was kept for the past nine months. The bright schoolgirl was just 14 when she went missing, and had no means to provide food, shelter or other necessities. Hope: Abigail's frantic family received a letter from the teenager after she went missing, giving them faith that she was still alive. Missed: Abigail's family and New Hampshire community had been searching for the schoolgirl for months. Contact: Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya, pictured left with the teenager's sister Sarah, wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned. New Hampshire police said it was a felony for any person to remove, detain or conceal a child under the age of 18, who is not a relative. If it is found that Abigail was removed against her will, or under the circumstances described by police, then appropriate charges will be brought. Attorney. General Foster said: 'We are all pleased Abigail was returned safely to. her family.

He added: 'The. individual or individuals who were involved with her disappearance and. absence will now have to face the consequences of any unlawful actions.' On a Facebook page that was set up to try to help find Abigail, a statement was released asking supporters for their patience while the investigation continued. Returned: Abigail Hernandez, pictured in security footage on the day she disappeared, returned home Sunday. 'Many people have been requesting specific answers and details as to exactly what happened to Abby. While we appreciate the desire for answers, this is still very much an ongoing law enforcement investigation and no details can be released that could jeopardize the integrity of their work,' the post said. Previous details about the case, including details of the letter the Hernandez family had received, were also delayed to protect the investigation. Officials delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials said at the time that although the letter had given them hope, they feared deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety. One FBI investigator had even suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to the young women in Cleveland, Ohio, who escaped after being held for ten years by Ariel Castro.

Is \\"The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought.\\" the correct answer?","response":"No, the statement \\"The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought.\\" does not directly address the part of Dukkha that deals with pain. While it refers to the Four Noble Truths as central to Buddhism, it does not specify which part of Dukkha (the first noble truth) is associated with pain. Let's delve into a more detailed and comprehensive answer on this topic. The First Noble Truth, which deals with the concept of Dukkha, acknowledges the presence of suffering, dissatisfaction, and discomfort in life. Dukkha is a Pali term that encompasses various types of suffering, such as mental, physical, and emotional distress. Throughout life, individuals experience various forms of discomfort, and according to Buddhism, understanding and accepting the nature of Dukkha is crucial to spiritual development. Dukkha can be divided into three broad categories that address different aspects of suffering: 1. Dukkha-dukkha (painful suffering): This category deals directly with the physical and mental pain that one may endure. It includes the discomfort caused by illness, injury, and other sources of physical affliction. Additionally, it encompasses emotional suffering such as grief, sadness, and disappointment. It's important to note that life involves a natural cycle of birth, illness, aging, and death, which leads to the inevitable experience of pain at some point. 2. Viparinama-dukkha (suffering caused by change): This form of Dukkha arises due to the ever-changing nature of life and the impermanence of everything. Even happiness and comfort are fleeting and do not last forever. Viparinama-dukkha highlights the fact that clinging to pleasant experiences or material possessions as a source of eternal happiness inevitably leads to suffering when they inevitably change or disappear. 3. Sankhara-dukkha (suffering due to conditioned states): This category of Dukkha emphasizes the deep-seated dissatisfaction and suffering that arise from the continuous cycle of rebirth or samsara, the notion of 'self,' and the various mental formations or sankharas. Sankhara-dukkha deals with the fundamental unsatisfactoriness of life, regardless of one's immediate external or internal circumstances. In summary, Dukkha encompasses a wide range of suffering, dissatisfaction, and unease that exist in life. The part of Dukkha that specifically deals with pain is Dukkha-dukkha, which covers both physical and emotional pain. Understanding the various aspects of Dukkha is crucial in the journey to overcome it and ultimately attain Nirvana, the state free of suffering, according to Buddhist teachings."},{"question":"Tea at JK Tourism GH .

To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u, which is 10: 10u ÷ 10 = (-110) ÷ 10 u = -11 So the solution to the equation 9u + 2u - u = -110 is: u = -11"},{"question":"Question: Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Question: Where can we find this passage? - In a science book. - In a science fiction novel. - In a dictionary. - In a newspaper. A:","response":"The best answer would be \\"In a newspaper\\". This passage seems like it could be from an obituary or tribute article which is commonly found in newspapers. It does not fit the typical content of a science book, science fiction novel, or dictionary. A science book would focus more on scientific theories or discoveries. A science fiction novel would typically move beyond what is currently scientifically proven or established to imagine new scenarios, technologies, or realities. A dictionary would only provide definitions of words, not a detailed biographical article about an individual."},{"question":"seriously missing isla vista and her college life crew Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

Context: My then-teenage daughter and I went to a new restaurant. It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance!

The statement highlights the importance of interconnecting member states for the overall functionality and success of countries within a given region or organization. This interconnection is especially crucial for peripheral countries, which might be geographical or political outliers within the group. These peripheral locations can create some challenges, and thus, effective interconnection becomes essential for them to reap the full benefits of membership. Interconnection could refer to a wide range of collaborations, such as economic, political, infrastructural or cultural exchanges between the member states. It can help these countries better achieve common goals, facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people across the region, and promote overall development. For peripheral countries, improving interconnectivity is important for several reasons: 1. Economic growth: Strong links between countries foster trade exchanges and share resources, which can lead to increased economic opportunities resulting in overall growth. 2. Infrastructure development: Improved infrastructure, such as roads, rail networks, and power grids, can connect peripheral regions to central hubs, facilitating easier access to markets, and resources while reducing transportation costs and time. 3. Access to information and knowledge: Countries can benefit from sharing information, knowledge, and expertise on various subjects. This collaboration can boost innovation and drive the advancement of technology, which in turn creates new opportunities for both economic and social development. 4. Strengthening political ties: Interconnectivity between member states helps build trust, maintain peace, and promote cooperation on shared challenges, such as security or environmental issues. This can help ensure stability and prevent conflicts in the long run. 5. Promotion of cultural exchange: Interconnected countries can share and promote their cultural heritage, leading to increased appreciation, understanding, and respect for each other's traditions and values. These exchanges can foster stronger relationships and promote unity among the member states. Efforts to strengthen interconnectivity between member states can take various forms, such as policy agreements, financial support, and externally-funded projects. By working together, these countries achieve greater synergy and a more significant impact on infrastructural, economic and social development, ultimately benefitting all involved nations and citizens.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... A:","response":"The region that supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry is the area around the Everglades in Florida. The estuaries around the Everglades create a productive ecosystem for various species, including the Tortugas pink shrimp and stone crab. Moreover, the presence of mangrove trees, which consist of red, black, and white mangroves, helps stabilize the coastline and provide a suitable habitat for various marine life, including those that are commercially harvested in Florida."},{"question":"Write an email with the subject line \\"TW Weekly for November 30, 2001\\".","response":"Step 1: Determine the purpose of the email The purpose of the email appears to be to provide information about a weekly update/newsletter for a specific date, November 30, 2001.

It has been the source of many cuneiform tablets, making it rank with Ugarit, Mari and Ebla among the most important archeological sites of Syria. In these texts, dating from the 14th century BC to the fall of Emar in 1187 BC, and in excavations in several campaigns since the 1970s, Emar emerges as an important Bronze Age trade center, occupying a liminal position between the power centers of Upper Mesopotamia and Anatolia-Syria. Unlike other cities, the tablets preserved at Emar, most of them in Akkadian and of the thirteenth century BC, are not royal or official, but record private transactions, judicial records, dealings in real estate, marriages, last wills, formal adoptions. In the house of a priest, a library contained literary and lexical texts in the Mesopotamian tradition, and ritual texts for local cults. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

The southern end of the river constitutes the border between Iraq and Iran down to the mouth of the river as it discharges into the Persian Gulf. It varies in width from about at Basra to at its mouth. It is thought that the waterway formed relatively recently in geologic time, with the Tigris and Euphrates originally emptying into the Persian Gulf via a channel further to the west. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

Its remains constitute a tell located about southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the third millennium BC and in the first half of the second millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia, and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the early Bronze Age. Karl Moore described the first Eblaite kingdom as the first recorded world power. - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia.

Answer:","response":"Barbalissos, also known as Qala'at Balis, was an ancient city in the Roman province of Euphratensis, located in modern-day Syria. Its site is marked by the ruins at Qala'at Balis, which partly retains the old name, south of Maskanah (the ancient Emar). Lake Assad, on the other hand, is a reservoir on the Euphrates river in Ar-Raqqah Governorate, Syria. It was created in 1974 when the Tabqa Dam was closed. Lake Assad is Syria's largest lake and an important source of water for irrigation, drinking, and fishing. The relationship between Barbalissos and Lake Assad is that both are located in modern-day Syria and are in close proximity to the Euphrates river. Barbalissos is situated south of Maskanah, which is near the man-made Lake Assad.

While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

The Justice Department has yet to make any official announcement, but sources close to the department have said such a prosecution would be unlikely, in part because of the extraordinarily high legal standard federal prosecutors would need to meet.

First, break down the key components of our hypothesis: a. The player is playing doubles b. The match is happening on an indoor court 2. Analyze each of the hypothesis components in relation to the premise: a. Playing doubles: The premise only indicates a tennis player preparing to hit the ball, but it does not specify whether they are playing doubles or singles. b. Indoor court: The premise gives no information about the type of playing environment, whether it's an indoor or outdoor court. 3. Recognize that there is a lack of information in the premise to justify the hypothesis. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, we would need more relevant information about the player's match format and the type of court they are playing on. 4. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis is true or false only based on the given premise.

The Respect Party MP also suffered a badly bruised face after he was assaulted in the street by a man who appeared to have taken exception to his controversial comments about Israel. Writing in The Mail on Sunday, the politician said he feared for his life when he was attacked in Notting Hill, West London, in broad daylight on Friday. And he called for police protection in future. A man has been charged with religiously aggravated assault after an attack that left outspoken MP George Galloway with a broken rib. Right, Neil Masterson as seen on Facebook and, left, Mr Galloway after the assault. Neil Masterson, 39, of Campden Hill, West London, will appear at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court tomorrow charged with attacking Mr Galloway and a man in his 40s who came to the MP’s aid. Last night, it emerged that a man of the same name made threats about Mr Galloway on Facebook hours before the incident. An account in that name carries a series of comments and abusive remarks about Muslims as well as claims that Galloway is anti-Semitic. The account holder ‘shared’ a picture of the politician, branding him a ‘snake’ and captioned: ‘Galloway is a Hamas and IRA supporter.’ Scene of the crime: Mr Galloway was attacked in Golborne Road (pictured) in Notting Hill, West London. The account holder commented, just hours before the attack: ‘I’d cut his throat myself if I’d dare stoop to the required level.’ He added: ‘Virulent antisemite of the worst kind. Doesn’t even have the gut [sic] to admit it. Drone’ Mr Galloway was posing for photographs when his attacker rushed across the street and assaulted him, swearing and shouting about the Holocaust. Tweet: The Respect Party tweeted this with the picture of a battered and bruised Mr Galloway after the assault. The Bradford West MP received treatment at nearby St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. Mr Galloway was interviewed under caution by police earlier this month after he said in a speech that Bradford had been ‘declared an Israel-free zone’ and urged people to reject all Israeli goods, services, academics and tourists. 'I crashed to the ground thinking... this man is going to kick me to death': George Galloway reveals his terror after attack in Notting Hill - and how he led police to suspect. By GEORGE GALLOWAY. I was walking down the street in Notting Hill in broad daylight and getting into my car when two Moroccan guys approached me. One of them said he was leaving Britain the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home. I stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took a picture. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell. Politician: George Galloway was left with a broken rib and bruising when he was assaulted by a man in street. He laid into me and was effing and blinding about the Holocaust. He looked like the type who works out and moved very fast. He punched me so many times I kept thinking, ‘When is this going to stop?’ But it didn’t. I went into what boxers call ‘peekaboo style’ like American heavyweight Floyd Patterson when he fought Muhammad Ali, covering my face and eyes. He got frustrated his punches weren’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb. I lost my footing and staggered backwards, crashing into a grille on a Moroccan delicatessen I had eaten at a few hours earlier. I was on the ground thinking ‘this man is going to kick me to death’. He was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw. I felt a terrible crack and sickening thud. It went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you. Luckily, the two Moroccan guys pulled him off. My attacker calmly walked across the road and I drove up the road behind him. I was in a bad way but I was determined he wouldn’t get away with it. I called 999 and described him to police. He knew I was behind him. I slowed down and the police told me to stop following him. I pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street. While I was talking to the police, he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop. At this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it. Three were women. It was like Cagney and Lacey. I shouted, ‘He is getting on the No 23 bus’ and the police drove into the middle of the road to stop it. Street: The Respect Party MP said he has 'no idea' why the attack in Golborne Road (pictured) took place. The policewomen bravely piled on to the bus, and brought a man out with handcuffs on. I have no idea why it happened, though I suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme Right-wing group. Regardless of his motives, I have no regrets about speaking out on issues like Israel and the Middle East. We live in a democracy, and as someone who has been elected as an MP on six occasions, I have a right to voice my opinions. And like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks, I am entitled to receive a degree of protection from the State so I can continue to do so. Even though I have just turned 60 years old, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I didn’t land a single blow. But I am not ready to stop fighting for what I believe in yet.

The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two. and a hint : Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms.

Options: - countryside - mountains - front yard - wisconsin - washington state Let's think step by step:","response":"Driving through rows of apple trees typically occurs in locations where apple orchards are prevalent. It is essential to consider each option to determine the most suitable places for such an activity. 1. Countryside: Apple orchards are often found in the countryside, as these areas have ample land, suitable soil, and favorable climate conditions for fruit cultivation. In general, the countryside is a good option for those seeking to experience apple orchards. 2. Mountains: While some apple orchards might be situated near or on mountain slopes, one might not necessarily associate mountains with apple tree cultivation. The high elevation and rough terrain could be less conducive for large-scale orchards. Nevertheless, some mountainous regions may have apple orchards, so the probability of driving through rows of apple trees varies depending on the mountain location. 3. Front yard: A front yard typically refers to the area directly in front of a residential property. It is highly unlikely that one would find large rows of apple trees to drive through in a front yard, as this space is usually limited and used primarily for landscaping or small gardens. 4. Wisconsin: Wisconsin, located in the upper Midwest region of the United States, is known for its dairy farming and cheese production. Although the state does have some apple orchards, it is not a leading producer of apples and might not have extensive rows of apple trees for driving experiences. 5. Washington State: Washington State, situated in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, has a thriving apple industry and is the leading apple-producing state in the country. The climate and soil conditions make it an ideal place for cultivating various apple varieties. Most of Washington State's apple orchards are located in the rural, central part of the state, like the Yakima Valley and Wenatchee region. It is highly probable that one would find opportunities to drive through rows of apple trees in Washington State. In summary, the most likely locations where someone might drive through rows of apple trees are the countryside and Washington State. Although apple orchards can also be found in mountain regions, front yards, and Wisconsin, these options pale in comparison to the likelihood of encountering such an experience in the vast rural areas or the apple-rich state of Washington."},{"question":"Question: In 1966, what replaced the Aust ferry? Answer:","response":"The Aust Ferry was replaced by the Severn Bridge in 1966. The Severn Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the River Severn and River Wye between England and Wales. This bridge heralded a significant achievement in bridge engineering during the mid-20th century. With a total length of 5,240 feet, it was a significant upgrade from the Aust Ferry. The Aust Ferry, which had served as a transport link between Aust and Beachley (the banks of Severn River) was essentially a reaction ferry, operating under the principle of utilizing the current of the water to push the boat across the river. It was restricted by tidal conditions, as it had to adapt to the tremendous tidal range of the Severn River, which is one the highest in the world. Consequently, the ferry did not operate on a regular schedule, offering passage only during high tides. Thus, the unreliable nature of the ferry coupled with increasing transport demands called for the construction of a more consistent solution. Following a series of discussions, plans and considerations, the construction of the Severn Bridge started in 1961 and was officially opened on 8th September 1966. The Severn Bridge was far more efficient and convenient, being able to handle far more cars and trucks on the motorway than the ferry, which could only accommodate a limited number of vehicles at a given time. It also provided a more reliable and continuous link between England and Wales, saving travel time; the ferry journey took about 10 minutes while the bridge takes cars across in just a couple of minutes. The Severn Bridge was officially inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, marking the end of the Aust Ferry service. The bridge not only improved connectivity between South Wales and South West England but also boosted trade and economic growth with better transport infrastructure. With the opening of the bridge, the region no longer relied on a highly unpredictable ferry service, and it marked a significant moment in the history of British infrastructure. In 1996, the bridge was supplemented by the Second Severn Crossing, renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge in 2018, which further enhanced road transport capacity across the River Severn. In summary, the Aust Ferry was replaced by an exemplar of modern engineering; the Severn Bridge, in 1966. This transition symbolized a step forward in technological advancement and infrastructure development, which had significant implications on the region's connectivity and socio-economic progress."},{"question":"The day was sunny and warm.

She has grown up to be a strong-willed young woman with a talent for archery, much like her father. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her. Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde). It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne â not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince).

The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks.

Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits.

Solve 0 = -1360*w - 57849 - 29191 for w.","response":"To solve the given equation, 0 = -1360*w - 57849 - 29191 for w, you need to isolate w on one side. The steps to solve the equation are as follows: Step 1: Combine the constants. 0 = -1360*w - (57849 + 29191) Add the numbers 57849 and 29191 to get the sum: 0 = -1360*w - 87040 Step 2: Isolate the w term To do this, we need to get rid of the -87040 and -1360 terms on the right-hand side of the equation. First, we move the -87040 constant to the left-hand side by adding 87040 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 87040 = -1360*w - 87040 + 87040 87040 = -1360*w Step 3: Solve for w Now that we have the equation 87040 = -1360*w, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by -1360. 87040 / -1360 = (-1360*w) / -1360 Which simplifies to: -64 = w So the solution to the given equation is w = -64."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner gets her cut (it is later found out that Natalie paid him to have her kicked out). Janey and a guy named Jeff Maline (Lee Montgomery) both shine, albeit partnered with others at first. They are later paired once the final cut is made.

His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003. Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\" Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union. In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped. In November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection. What style?","response":"The style of the Sean John clothing line, founded by Sean Combs in 1998, can be characterized as urban, contemporary, and fashion-forward menswear.

While their initial focus was on men's clothing, by early 2016, Sean John expanded the brand by introducing a GIRLS collection. Apart from clothing, Sean John also ventured into fragrances with the release of a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" in November 2008.

Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson,...

Without these ideas, the notion is empty. Step 2: Identify the components of the hypothesis Hypothesis: These ideas are not good but are needed. Components: 1. These ideas are not good. 2. These ideas are needed. Step 3: Compare the components Now, let's compare the components of the premise and hypothesis to see if the first supports the second. 1. Ideas being terrible vs. Ideas being not good - Both the premise and hypothesis agree that these ideas have negative qualities. 2. Without the ideas, the notion is empty vs. The ideas are needed - The premise states that without these ideas, the notion lacks substance or meaning, making it \\"empty\\". The hypothesis states that these ideas are necessary or required. In both cases, there's an underlying sentiment that these ideas play a crucial role despite their negative qualities. Step 4: Assess the relationship between premise and hypothesis Based on the comparison in Step 3, we can see that the components of the premise align with those of the hypothesis. Terrible ideas in the premise are equivalent to not good ideas in the hypothesis, and the notion being empty without them corresponds to the idea's necessity.

Nina sold 10 bracelets at 15.00 each, so the total is 10 * 15.00 = 150.00. Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from the earrings. Nina sold 20 earrings at 10.00 each, so the total is 20 * 10.00 = 200.00. Step 4: Calculate Nina's earnings from the complete jewelry ensembles.

Been passed down from generation to generation in these parts.\\" Gansey raised a curious eyebrow as he tried to picture the building in its prime. There was something magnetic about the location that sparked a deep sense of curiosity. Blue, with her vibrant eyes and intuitive nature, couldn't help but feel drawn to the mysterious past that seemed to surround the area. \\"The origin of the curse dates back to the early 1800s,\\" Jesse began, the twang in his voice lending a certain charm to the tale. \\"You see, old man Wilkins, he built the place as a hideaway for the town's misfits and outcasts, folks who couldn't fit in anywhere else. Now, despite bein' somethin' of an outcast himself, Wilkins had a heart o' gold, he did. He took in those who had nowhere else to go - the sick, the poor, the kids who'd been kicked out of their homes or fled from violence, even folks who had strange abilities that made 'em more than a little unwelcome in polite society …\\" As Jesse continued, Gansey and Blue shared a glance of intrigue, both well-accustomed to seeking the odd and unexplainable. It was evident that the story of the cursed building held all the trappings of a fascinating mystery. \\"But,\\" Jesse went on, his voice lowering to a somber tone, \\"it ain't all happy endin's and welcome arms here. The curse, you see, it started when one of them outsiders - a fella by the name of Geraint Dupont - took shelter under old man Wilkins' roof.

The tale goes that anyone who lives in or visits the buildin' either meets a gruesome fate or is cursed with terrible misfortune forever after.\\" There was a pregnant pause as Jesse scanned the horizon, as if expecting the unseen force of the curse to make its presence known. Gansey, ever the adventurer, couldn't help but feel a delicious shiver down his spine at the prospect of exploring such a haunted place. \\"Now, as for your other question,\\" Jesse said, turning back to Blue. \\"Folks around these parts have been talkin' 'bout the curse for years and years, so it's hard to put an exact number on how long it's been around. I reckon it's been a good two hundred years at least, maybe more.\\" \\"So, they say that even stepping foot on the grounds is enough to bring down the curse's wrath?\\" Blue inquired, her curiosity getting the better of her. Jesse hesitated, his eyes darting from Gansey to Blue. \\"Well,\\" he stated, \\"there are some folks who think it's all a bunch of hogwash, nothin' more than stories to scare the youngsters.

While it is highly improbable for a person to survive without food for such an extended period, it is not entirely impossible in some extreme cases. However, this sentence can still be considered logically coherent, although it presents an unusual scenario. - Sentence B: \\"he had a bowl of chicken soup for lunch\\" This sentence states that the person consumed a bowl of chicken soup during lunchtime. It is a perfectly reasonable and coherent statement, as it describes a common meal and a regular human activity, making it easily understandable. Based on our analysis, both sentences are logically coherent.

Then, he went so far as to pull up a reproduction Where's Waldo? cover, Reuters reports. \\"Everyone in this CDO group, including the managing directors, knew as much or more than Brian Stoker did,\\" Keker said.

Keker argued that Citi as a whole was to blame, not Stoker individually. The jury apparently agreed, today declaring that Stoker was not liable for misleading investors, reports BusinessWeek. Expand this summary.","response":"Before the jury began its deliberations in the fraud trial of former Citigroup banker Brian Stoker, his lawyer, John Keker, made a memorable argument. He stated that most of the trial had nothing to do with Stoker and compared the situation to the popular children's book series, \\"Where's Waldo?\\" He even presented a reproduction Where's Waldo? cover in court, according to Reuters. Keker argued that everyone involved in the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) group, including the managing directors, knew as much or more than Brian Stoker did. Thus, Stoker should not be held solely responsible for the fraud. Stoker was on trial for his role in hand-picking assets for a CDO, which he then sold to clients without informing them that Citigroup was betting 500 million it would fail. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused him of being part of Citigroup's overall plan to defraud investors. \\"Citigroup stacked the deck and Brian Stoker dealt the cards,\\" the SEC said in their closing argument. However, Keker argued that the blame should fall on Citigroup as a whole instead of solely on Stoker. In response to the defense's argument, the jury declared that Brian Stoker was not liable for misleading investors, as reported by BusinessWeek. This outcome demonstrates that the jury agreed with Keker's argument that Stoker alone should not be held responsible for the fraudulent actions related to the CDO. The trial raised important questions about individual accountability in complex financial crimes and brought attention to the issue of responsibility within large corporations like Citigroup. It also highlighted the need for better communication and transparency when selling complicated financial products to clients. However, the verdict may have set a precedent, making it difficult for regulatory agencies to hold individuals accountable for their role in future financial crimes."},{"question":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Laura fixed all of the electronics brought to them by Felicia, because","response":"Laura fixed all of the electronics brought to them by Felicia, because she possessed a natural talent for understanding and repairing complex devices. This unique ability had been cultivated over many years, starting from her childhood, when she would take apart old gadgets and appliances to discover how they worked. Over time, she honed her skills, developing a keen eye for identifying issues and finding effective solutions. Laura's fascination with technology extended to her academic pursuits as well. She studied electrical engineering in college, further solidifying her knowledge of electronic systems and components. As a result of her extensive experience, she was well-versed in a multitude of devices, including computers, smartphones, gaming consoles, and home appliances. When Felicia approached Laura with a collection of broken electronics, she did so knowing that her friend's expertise would be of great help. Felicia had recently helped a local community center clean out their storage room, and the building's staff had discovered a variety of neglected and malfunctioning equipment. Believing that these devices could be restored and put to good use, Felicia sought Laura's assistance in assessing and repairing the items. Eager to lend a hand, Laura found reward in the challenge of restoring the abandoned electronics to their former glory. Each device required a unique approach in diagnosing and resolving its specific problems. Laura meticulously checked for damaged components, soldering joints, loose connections, and firmware issues in order to determine the best course of action. Seeing potential in repurposing these seemingly obsolete pieces of technology, Laura consulted with Felicia regarding possible applications once they were fully functional. They discussed the idea of donating the repaired items to underprivileged schools, community centers, and other institutions that could gain significant benefits from having access to updated technology. This plan to extend the life of these devices aligned with their shared belief in environmental responsibility, as it would help to combat the growing problem of e-waste and minimize the demand for new, resource-intensive products. As Laura carefully tended to each device, she also took advantage of the opportunity to impart her knowledge to Felicia. Together, they talked about common electronic failures, methods for troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance practices. Laura hoped that this experience would inspire Felicia to develop her own interest in technology and its restoration. In the end, Laura managed to repair all of the electronics brought to her by Felicia, successfully breathing new life into the devices and setting them on course for a second chance at usefulness. Their collaborative efforts not only benefited their immediate community but also highlighted the importance of making the most of available resources and nurturing one's skills to make a meaningful impact."},{"question":"\\"Někdo si nás prohlíží na dlouhém rozsahu!\\" vykřikl detekční operátor.

The Assyrian homeland or Assyria refers to a geographic and cultural region situated in Northern Mesopotamia that has been traditionally inhabited by Assyrian people. The areas that form the Assyrian homeland are parts of present-day northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran and, more recently, northeastern Syria. Moreover, the area that had the greatest concentration of Assyrians in the world until recently, is located in the Assyrian Triangle, a region which comprises the Nineveh plains, southern Hakkari and the Barwari regions. This is where some Assyrian groups seek to create an independent nation state. During World War I the Assyrians suffered the Assyrian Genocide which reduced their numbers by up to two thirds. Subsequent to this, they entered the war on the side of the British and Russians. After World War I, the Assyrian homeland was divided between the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, which would become the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, and the French Mandate of Syria which would become the Syrian Arab Republic in 1944. Assyrians faced reprisals under the Hashemite monarchy for co-operating with the British during the years after World War I, and many fled to the West. The Patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII, though born into the line of Patriarchs at Qochanis, was educated in Britain. For a time he sought a homeland for the Assyrians in Iraq but was forced to take refuge in Cyprus in 1933, later moving to Chicago, Illinois, and finally settling near San Francisco, California. The Assyrian Chaldean Christian community was less numerous and vociferous at the time of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, and did not play a major role in the British rule of the country. However, with the exodus of Assyrian Church of the East members, the Chaldean Catholic Church became the largest non-Muslim religious denomination in Iraq, and some Assyrian Catholics later rose to power in the Ba'ath Party government, the most prominent being Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. The Assyrians of Dohuk boast one of the largest churches in the region named the Mar Marsi Cathedral, and is the center of an Eparchy. Tens of thousands of Yazidi and Assyrian Christian refugees live in the city as well due to the ISIS invasion of Iraq in 2014 and the subsequent Fall of Mosul In addition to the Assyrian population, an Aramaic speaking Jewish population existed in the region for thousands of years, living mainly in Barwari, Zakho and Alqosh. However, All of the Barwari Jews either left or were exiled to Israel shortly after its independence in 1947. The region was heavily affected by the Kurdish uprisings during the 1950s and 60s and was largely depopulated during the Al-Anfal campaign in the 1980s, although some of its population later returned and their homes were subsequently rebuilt.

Step 1: Define the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the limbs and their attachment to the axial skeleton, which are the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Step 2: Understand the regions of the appendicular skeleton. The appendicular skeleton is divided into the following regions: - The upper extremities (shoulders, arms, forearms, wrists, and hands) - The lower extremities (hips, thighs, legs, ankles, and feet) - The pectoral girdle (the bones that connect the upper limbs to the axial skeleton) - The pelvic girdle (the bones that connect the lower limbs to the axial skeleton) Step 3: Identify the location of the fibula. The fibula is one of the two bones in the lower leg, located opposite the tibia (the larger of the two bones). Together, the tibia and fibula form the connection between the knee and the ankle. Step 4: Determine the region where the fibula is found. Since the fibula is one of the bones in the lower leg, it is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton. Thus, the answer to the question is that the fibula is found in the lower extremities region of the appendicular skeleton."},{"question":"(In 1949, you could get a four-room Cape Cod cottage for under 8,000.)

Choose your answer from: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","response":"(iii) no It does not follow that \\"Any real estate outside of Cape Cod in 1949 cost well above 8,000.\\" The statement that you could buy a four-room Cape Cod cottage for under 8,000 in 1949 provides information about the cost of a specific type of property in Cape Cod during that year. However, it does not provide adequate information to make a universal claim about the cost of all real estate outside of Cape Cod. Real estate prices can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, property type, market conditions, and economic trends. The cost of real estate in one area of the country may not accurately reflect or predict the cost of real estate in other locations. While it is possible that certain properties outside of Cape Cod in 1949 were priced higher than 8,000, it is also likely that many other properties were available at lower prices, depending on the location and type of property. Remember that housing prices in 1949 were also generally much lower than they are today, so a property priced well above 8,000 in today's terms may not have been considered particularly expensive at the time. To make an accurate statement about real estate prices outside Cape Cod in 1949, one would need data on property values, inflation rates, and economic trends from that time period, and compare these with similar data for other regions across the country. Furthermore, one should consider the specific types of properties being compared, as a four-room Cape Cod cottage might not be directly comparable to a larger house or a different architectural style in a different location. In conclusion, the statement about the cost of a four-room Cape Cod cottage in 1949 does not provide enough information to make a general claim about all real estate outside of Cape Cod during that time. It is essential to consider other factors and gather additional data to make a more accurate assessment of property prices and trends in different regions and time periods."},{"question":"Leo: Premise: \\"A young girl in a green shirt and shorts out riding her bike past a very nice apartment building.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The young girl skateboards back home.\\" is true?

Step 1: Identify the needs of the community The context mentions a biotechnology district and medical facilities, which implies that there will be professionals working in these establishments who may need housing nearby. Additionally, mixed-use structures are already present in the area. Step 2: Consider the current infrastructure The existing buildings on Frontage Road include a Pfizer drug-testing clinic, a medical laboratory building, and a mixed-use structure with parking, housing, and office space. This indicates that the area is already being developed with mixed-use structures in mind. Step 3: Maintain consistency with the area's development plan As the area is being progressively developed as a biotechnology district and has been successful in attracting biotechnology and medical firms, it is important to continue supporting this type of development by providing housing opportunities for the professionals working in these industries. Step 4: Balance land use and available resources By creating a mixed-use structure containing residential units, parking, and additional office spaces, the needs of the community can be met without overextending resources or causing unnecessary urban sprawl. Step 5: Ensure accessibility and convenience for residents Including parking spaces in the mixed-use structure ensures that residents and workers have easy access to their vehicles, making it convenient for them to commute to other parts of the city or nearby facilities. In conclusion, a mixed-use structure that includes residential units, parking, and office spaces would be the most suitable option to accommodate people living on Frontage Road, given the existing infrastructure and the needs of the community focused on biotechnology and medical industries."},{"question":"What's an example of a movie review?","response":"Title: Parasite (2019) Directed by: Bong Joon-ho Starring: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam Review: Bong Joon-ho's critically-acclaimed masterpiece, \\"Parasite\\" (2019), captivated audiences worldwide with its gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking commentary on social inequality. The South Korean film, which traverses through a plethora of genres, tells the story of two families from opposing social classes, whose lives become entangled in a twisted game of survival and deception. At the core of the film is the financially struggling Kim family, living in despair and poverty in a semi-basement apartment. When their son, Ki-woo (played brilliantly by Choi Woo-shik), secures a job as an English tutor for the affluent Park family, a golden opportunity arises. The Kims seize this chance and embark on a cunning plan to infiltrate the Park's luxurious home as service providers, all under false pretenses. From the outset, Bong establishes a powerful visual dichotomy of space and class, showcasing the squalid, cramped living conditions of the Kim family, which stand in stark contrast to the opulent, spacious abode of the Parks. This disparity in their surroundings is mirrored in their respective attitudes and lifestyles, amplifying the central theme of class struggle that permeates the film. The tension between classes is explored not only through dramatic confrontations but also through biting humor. The Kim family's manipulative and deceitful antics, while unsettling, evoke dark comedic undertones. This perfect blend of drama, thriller, and black comedy creates an immersive and enthralling viewing experience, with moments of gut-wrenching desperation juxtaposed against scenes of absurd hilarity. The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances throughout, upholding the film's emotional intensity. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, navigates through the complexities of his character with finesse, while Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong excel as the wealthy Park couple, deftly portraying a mix of privilege, vulnerability, and obliviousness. Furthermore, \\"Parasite\\" is a technical triumph. Bolstered by stunning cinematography from Hong Kyung-pyo and a haunting, yet beautifully fitting score by Jung Jae-il, the film is engrossing from start to finish. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction and meticulous attention to detail shine through in every frame, making the film visually and thematically cohesive. Yet, what sets \\"Parasite\\" apart from other social commentaries is its ability to provoke introspection. Subverting traditional narrative arcs and refusing to take a singular moral stance, the film pushes viewers to question not just the characters' actions but also the unseen societal forces that drive such desperate acts. In conclusion, \\"Parasite\\" is an unforgettable cinematic tour-de-force that transcends genre boundaries and expertly presents a thought-provoking examination of class struggle in contemporary society. With its stellar cast, exceptional direction, and hauntingly beautiful visuals, Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece effortlessly earns its place among the modern greats in world cinema.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","response":"No, the answer you found is not a correct or complete explanation of a Network Interface Card (NIC). A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. It is also known as a network adapter or LAN (Local Area Network) card. The NIC is an essential piece of equipment that allows computers to communicate and exchange data with other devices on the same network, such as routers, switches, and other computers. NICs can be in different forms, such as a PCI or PCIe card that plugs into the computer's motherboard or as an integrated component on the motherboard. Modern NICs support several types of network protocols, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi, to connect with wired or wireless networks. They are also available in different speeds, ranging from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps and higher, to cater to various network requirements. To sum up, the Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component responsible for connecting computers to networks and facilitating communication between devices on the network.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin than Matt's melanocytes. Although Matt and Jesse are twins and share many genetic similarities, it is evident that their skin color is not exactly the same. Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion, indicating a higher melanin production in his skin. Melanin, produced by melanocytes, is responsible for skin color, and individuals with darker skin typically have melanocytes that produce more melanin than those with lighter skin. Despite both Matt and Jesse having about the same number of melanocytes, the difference in their skin tone suggests that Jesse's melanocytes are more efficient in producing melanin. It is also important to note that exposure to UV light plays a role in melanin production, as well as the development of a tan. When Matt was out in the sun for an extended period, his skin likely experienced an increase in melanin production, which made his skin tone temporarily darker and more similar to Jesse's. However, this change was temporary, and Matt's natural skin tone would eventually return once the effects of the sun exposure wore off. In conclusion, Jesse's melanocytes produce more melanin compared to Matt's melanocytes, resulting in his slightly darker skin complexion. It is crucial to understand that factors like genetics and sun exposure can impact melanin production, making it essential for individuals to protect their skin and ensure they receive an adequate amount of essential nutrients such as vitamin D."},{"question":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","response":"Context: Imagine we are in a colorful garden with lots of beautiful flowers, busy bees, and fluttering butterflies.

A Simple Explanation Hey little buddy! Today, we're going to talk about something called \\"blockhouses.\\" But first, let me explain what a blockhouse is. A blockhouse is a small, strong building made from big wooden logs or stones. People built these blockhouses a long time ago to protect themselves from enemies or dangerous animals. Now, let us discover who built these blockhouses. 1. Soldiers: A long time ago, soldiers built blockhouses in different parts of the world. They built them when they went to new places so they could have a safe place to stay and keep watch for any enemies. Soldiers could also store their food and guns in the blockhouse. It was like a little home away from home for soldiers, with strong walls to keep them safe. 2. Settlers: Settlers are people who move to new places to live. When settlers went to new lands, they needed to build strong houses to keep their families safe. So, they built blockhouses to protect them from bad weather, animals, and other people who might want to hurt them. Settlers built these houses using logs or stones they found around them. 3. Native Peoples: In some parts of the world, native peoples who lived in the land for a long time also built blockhouses. They used the materials from their area, like wood or stones, to make their blockhouses strong and safe. These native people built blockhouses to protect their families and the things important to them, like food and tools. In summary, many people built blockhouses like soldiers, settlers, and native peoples. They all built these strong, safe buildings to protect themselves and the people they cared about. Building a blockhouse was a clever idea, and it helped people stay safe and sound in difficult times.

Answer: opposing","response":"To provide supporting facts for the answer \\"opposing\\" in the context of the triceps and biceps muscle relationship in the upper arm, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Explain the basic function of biceps and triceps muscles. The biceps are the muscles located on the front of the upper arm, and they are responsible for flexing the arm at the elbow. The triceps are located at the back of the upper arm and are responsible for extending or straightening the arm at the elbow. Step 2: Describe the contraction and relaxation process of the muscles. When one muscle contracts, the opposite muscle relaxes. For instance, when the biceps contract, the triceps relax to allow arm flexion, and when the triceps contract, the biceps relax to allow arm extension.

They embark on a dangerous expedition aboard a state-of-the-art research vessel named the Abyssal Seeker. As they dive into the unexplored depths of the ocean, they soon encounter mysterious phenomena – bioluminescent creatures, underwater earthquakes, and puzzling sonar readings. These strange occurrences lead the team to believe they are inching closer to discovering the elusive giant squid and its home. As they delve deeper, they stumble upon an underwater cave system, believed to be the habitat of the gargantuan squid. The cave system is filled with bizarre and colossal creatures, remnants of a lost era. It quickly becomes apparent that this place is far from ordinary – in fact, it's the remnant of a sunken, ancient city. Within its murky depths lies a powerful artifact, guarded by the giant squid. Meanwhile, Robert Kage reveals his true intentions. He believes the artifact possesses immense power, and he aims to secure it for himself. He has secretly placed agents within the expedition to sabotage the mission and secure the artifact for him. In the dramatic climax, the team must work together to stop Kage's schemes, uncover the truth about the colossal squid, and prevent the lost city's secrets from being misused. The Abyssal Seeker is damaged in the ensuing battle with the awakened giant squid, ultimately leading to its demise as it defends its home against outside threats. In the end, the team decides to keep the lost city and its enigmatic artifact a secret, knowing that some mysteries are best left untouched. They return to the surface with a newfound understanding of the ocean's ancient treasures and the responsibility to protect it. The Claw of the Abyss serves as a thrilling adventure film with elements of sci-fi and mystery, exploring themes of preservation, teamwork, and the consequences of exploiting the unknown."},{"question":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a breakdown of how government buying meat for everyone affects the steps in the process mentioned: 1. When the government buys meat for everyone, it increases the demand for meat. 2. To meet this demand, meat production has to increase, which leads to an increase in livestock farming. 3. Livestock farming, particularly cattle farming, is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, through their digestive processes, and their manure also emits greenhouse gases. 4. Increased greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from livestock, will contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 5. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has the effect of trapping more heat from the Sun. 6. Different things on Earth will experience increased temperatures as a result of the trapped heat, leading to an overall increase in the planet's temperature, a phenomenon known as global warming. So, in this scenario, increasing meat production due to the government buying meat for everyone indirectly impacts the process by contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn traps more heat and leads to a hotter planet."},{"question":"Station 19 is an American action-drama television series created by Stacy McKee for ABC.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Movie title: Outbreak Movie plot: Motaba, a fictional virus which causes a deadly fever, is discovered in the African jungle in 1967. To maintain the virus as a viable biological weapon, two U.S. Army officers, Donald McClintock and William Ford, destroy the camp where it was found after taking blood samples from the dying victims.Twenty-eight years later, in 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire. Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate. He and his crew, Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler, and new recruit Major Salt gain information about the virus and return to the United States, where Daniels asks his superior, now-Brigadier General William Ford, to put out an alert. Ford knows that the virus is not new, but he tells Daniels it is unlikely to show up. Daniels' ex-wife and former crew-member Roberta Keough, has left USAMRIID to take the lead role of a similar team at the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia and is convinced by Daniels to recommend an alert from the CDC, but her superior balks as well.Meanwhile, we learn that the virus arrived via a host animal, a white-headed capuchin monkey, that was smuggled into the United States. James \\"Jimbo\\" Scott, an employee at the Bio-Test animal holding facility, bribed a security guard and took the monkey to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market.

Not able to care for the monkey, Jimbo releases it into the woods.

Keough investigates the infections but finds that no one other... Answer:","response":"No, I can't answer the question about who arrests Daniels from the movie Outbreak based on the plot provided. However, I can provide some information that may help you in deciding whether to invest in the film proposal or not. 1. Genre and Market Appeal: Outbreak is a thriller/drama film, which generally has a broad market appeal. Movies that feature suspense, mystery, and a race against time often attract a large number of viewers who enjoy the tension and adrenaline rush experienced when watching this type of movie. Additionally, the film has a medical and scientific aspect, which may attract viewers interested in this subject matter. 2. Star Power: The success of a movie is often highly correlated with the star power of its actors. Films that feature well-known and highly-regarded actors in major roles tend to attract a larger audience and generate higher box office revenues. If the film proposal for Outbreak mentions any actors with substantial star power, it could potentially increase the attractiveness of the investment. 3. Director and Production Team: The director and production team can have a significant impact on the quality of a movie. A director with a strong track record of producing successful and critically-acclaimed films is more likely to create a great film that will attract viewers. It's important to take into consideration the experience and background of the director and production team when evaluating the investment potential of a movie proposal. 4. Budget and Expected Returns: Analyzing the film's proposed budget and comparing it to similar movies in the market can help you estimate the potential return on your investment. Consider whether the proposed budget seems realistic and if comparable movies have managed to generate substantial box office revenues. 5. Potential for Franchise and Merchandising Opportunities: If the film has the potential for a sequel or franchise, it may be worth investing in the project. Successful franchises often generate multiple revenue streams, including box office sales, merchandising, and licensing fees. Examine the possibility of the film turning into a franchise and if it has strong merchandising potential. 6. Risk Factors: As with any investment, it's crucial to consider potential risk factors and have a clear understanding of the worst-case scenario. The movie industry can be unpredictable, and even well-executed films can fail at the box office due to unforeseen circumstances. Determine your risk tolerance before investing in a film proposal. In conclusion, while I am unable to answer the specific question about who arrests Daniels in the movie Outbreak, considering the factors mentioned above can help you make a more informed decision about whether or not to invest in the film proposal. Assess the market appeal, star power, director, budget, franchise and merchandising potential, and risk factors to make an educated decision."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Ausführlichere Antwort: In jüngster Zeit gab es eine Zunahme von Cyber-Angriffen auf verschiedene Organisationen. In diesem speziellen Fall sehen sich sowohl WikiLeaks als auch die großen Kreditkartenunternehmen Visa und MasterCard den Auswirkungen von Cyber-Angriffen gegenüber. Ziel solcher Angriffe ist es, die Funktionsfähigkeit der jeweiligen Organisation und ihrer Webserver zu beeinträchtigen. Die Server von WikiLeaks, einer Organisation, die für die Veröffentlichung von geheimen Informationen und Nachrichten von Regierungen und Unternehmen bekannt ist, wurden angegriffen. Die Angreifer versuchen, die Server lahmzulegen und den Zugriff auf die von WikiLeaks bereitgestellten Informationen zu verhindern. Diese Angriffe könnten auf staatliche oder nichtstaatliche Akteure zurückzuführen sein, die versuchen, den Informationsfluss von WikiLeaks einzuschränken und die Organisation daran zu hindern, weitere geheime Informationen preiszugeben. Als Reaktion auf diese Angriffe haben einige Unterstützer von WikiLeaks ihre Kräfte vereint, um die Webserver von Visa und MasterCard zu bombardieren und diese zum Stillstand zu bringen. Es wird angenommen, dass diese Cyber-Aktivisten versuchen, Vergeltung für den Angriff auf WikiLeaks zu üben und gleichzeitig den Druck auf diese Kreditkartenunternehmen zu erhöhen, diese Angriffe nicht weiter zu unterstützen oder zumindest ihre Maßnahmen gegen WikiLeaks zu überdenken. Solche koordinierten Angriffe auf Webserver, insbesondere solche, die mithilfe von Botnetzen durchgeführt werden, werden als Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Angriffe (DDoS) bezeichnet.

After being told that she is going to a boarding school, she runs off into the forest where she meets Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring at the foot of a great tree. She is kidnapped by his older brother Miles and brought back to the Tucks' home where they tell her they'll return her as soon as they can trust her. She becomes enamored of their slow and simple way of life and falls in love with Jesse. She learns that the Tucks cannot age or be injured due to drinking water from a magic spring around a hundred years ago and that they kidnapped her to hide the secret. They tell her that living forever is more painful than it sounds and believe that giving away the secret of the spring will lead to everyone wanting to drink from it. A man in a yellow suit befriends the Fosters while Winnie is gone. He spies on the Tucks and he desires the spring to sell the water. He makes a deal to save Winnie and get the forest. He goes to the Tucks and orders them to reveal where the spring is; when they deny any knowledge about the spring he threatens Winnie with a pistol. He calls their bluff by shooting Jesse and exposing his youth; but in return Jesse's mother, Mae, kills him with the rear end of a rifle. The constable sees the attack and arrests Mae for killing the man. She and Angus are sentenced to be hanged for kidnapping Winnie and murdering the man. After being returned home, Winnie is woken by Jesse who begs her to help him free his parents. The family fears that if Mae and Angus are in fact hanged the next day, they won't die and their immortality will be exposed. Winnie helps Jesse and Miles to break the Tucks out of jail and goodbye to them. Jesse, who has fallen in love with Winnie, asks her to join them, but Angus warns her that it is dangerous to go with them as they will be hunted. Jesse tells Winnie to drink from the spring so she could live forever and never age, then he will come back...

The discussion centered around the allegations of corruption and mismanagement connected with the program. The Oil-for-Food program was established by the United Nations in 1995 as a humanitarian effort aimed at providing much-needed resources to Iraq's civilian population, who were suffering the detrimental effects of economic sanctions imposed on Saddam Hussein's regime by the UN. Under the program, Iraq was permitted to export limited amounts of oil in return for food, medicine, and other essential items to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi citizens. Despite its noble intentions, the Oil-for-Food program soon became marred by widespread claims of corruption, fraud, and mismanagement. Allegations of improprieties included individuals and companies throughout the world who had allegedly manipulated the program for personal or political gain. In response to these claims, the United Nations tasked an independent team of investigators with the responsibility of examining and addressing the allegations to determine the extent of the corruption within the program. Kofi Annan, who was the UN Secretary-General during the time the Oil-for-Food program was operational, recently met with the chief investigator to lend his support and assistance to the ongoing probe. Annan expressed his commitment to ensuring a thorough and impartial examination of the program, given its critical importance to the credibility and reputation of the United Nations. \\"I have pledged my wholehearted support and cooperation to this investigation,\\" Annan said during the meeting with the investigator. \\"The United Nations must be beyond reproach in its conduct, and I encourage all parties involved to be completely transparent and forthcoming with information.\\" Annan's meeting with the chief investigator signifies a dedication to uncovering the truth behind the extensive corruption allegations surrounding the Oil-for-Food program. In addition to the individual charges of fraud and mismanagement, the scandal has also raised questions about systemic weaknesses within the United Nations that may have allowed for the corruption to take place. As the investigation enters its next phase, the chief investigator and his team intend to leverage the insights gained from their discussion with Annan to add context, nuance, and clarity to their ongoing assessment of the Oil-for-Food program. The comprehensive nature of their probe will encompass not only the individual actors implicated in the scandal but also the underlying structural problems that could have contributed to the program's widespread exploitation. Ultimately, it is hoped that the investigative team's diligent work will lay the foundation for much-needed reforms within the United Nations while ensuring that the organization remains a highly-regarded and essential force for good in the world. In conclusion, the meeting between Kofi Annan and the chief investigator of the Oil-for-Food program strongly emphasizes the importance of transparency, impartiality, and comprehensive assessment in addressing the allegations of corruption surrounding the program. As the investigation continues, it is key that the United Nations learns from this situation by identifying and rectifying any structural weaknesses that were exploited in the Oil-for-Food scandal to preserve the organization's credibility and integrity."},{"question":"Background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Paragraph: Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team learned less about wolves? The answer to this question is:","response":"Team B learned less about wolves. This is because Team A studied predators, which includes wolves as they are an apex predator in many ecosystems.

Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. - Kuwait ('), officially the State of Kuwait ('), is a country in Western Asia. Situated in the northern edge of Eastern Arabia at the tip of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. , Kuwait has a population of 4.2 million people; 1.3 million are Kuwaitis and 2.9 million are expatriates. Expatriates account for 70% of the population. - Antiochus I Soter ( Greek : ; epithet means \`\` the Saviour '' ; c. 324/3 -- 261 BC ) , was a king of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire . He reigned in 281 -- 261 BC. Antiochus I was half Persian , his mother Apama being one of the eastern princesses whom Alexander the Great had given as wives to his generals in 324 BC. In 294 BC , prior to the death of his father Seleucus I , Antiochus married his stepmother , Stratonice , daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes . His elderly father reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son was in danger of dying of lovesickness . Stratonice bore five children to Antiochus : Seleucus ( he was executed for rebellion ) , Laodice , Apama II , Stratonice of Macedon and Antiochus II Theos , who succeeded his father as king . On the assassination of his father in 281 BC , the task of holding together the empire was a formidable one . A revolt in Syria broke out almost immediately . Antiochus was soon compelled to make peace with his father 's murderer , Ptolemy Keraunos , apparently abandoning Macedonia and Thrace . In Anatolia he was unable to reduce Bithynia or the Persian dynasties that ruled in Cappadocia . In 278 BC the Gauls broke into Anatolia , and a victory that Antiochus won over these Gauls by using Indian war elephants ( 275 BC ) is said to have been the origin of his title of Soter ( Gr. for \`\` saviour '' ) . At the end of 275 BC the question of Coele - Syria , which had been open between the houses of Seleucus and Ptolemy since the partition of 301 BC , led to hostilities ( the First Syrian War ) . It had been continuously in Ptolemaic occupation , but the house of Seleucus maintained its claim . War did not materially change the outlines of the two kingdoms , though frontier cities like Damascus and the coast districts of Asia Minor might change hands . On March 27 268 BC Antiochus I laid the foundation for the Ezida Temple in Borsippa . His eldest son Seleucus had ruled in the east as viceroy from 275 BC ( ? ) till 268/267 BC ; Antiochus put his... - An epithet (from \\"epitheton\\", neut. of \\"epithetos\\", \\"attributed, added\\") is a byname, or a descriptive term (word or phrase), accompanying or occurring in place of a name and having entered common usage. It can be described as a glorified nickname. It has various shades of meaning when applied to seemingly real or fictitious people, divinities, objects, and binomial nomenclature. It can also be a descriptive title: for example, Alfred the Great, Suleiman the Magnificent or Wadysaw I the Elbow-high. - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792 1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696 1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi. - Seleucus I Nicator was one of the Diadochi. Having previously served as an infantry general under Alexander the Great, he eventually assumed the title of basileus and established the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Suleiman I (Modern ; 6 November 1494 6 September 1566), commonly known as Suleiman the Magnificent in the West and \\"Kanuni\\" (the Lawgiver) in his realm, was the tenth and longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 to his death in 1566. Under his administration, the Ottoman state ruled over 15 to 25 million people. - Alfred the Great (\\"elf counsel\\" or \\"wise elf\\"; 849 26 October 899) was King of Wessex from 871 to 899.

The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commencing on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK programming. What is the answer to this question: Who first developed consumer HD television with a 5:3 aspect ratio?","response":"The Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio. This breakthrough occurred in 1979 and represented a significant advancement in television technology. The system they developed was known as Hi-Vision or MUSE, which stands for Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding. This moniker refers to the method that was used to encode the broadcast signal. NHK's Hi-Vision or MUSE system was innovative and ground-breaking in terms of its technical specifications. It required about twice the bandwidth of the previous NTSC system, which was the standard at the time. Despite requiring a higher amount of bandwidth, the MUSE system was able to deliver a vastly superior resolution. Specifically, it provided about four times the resolution of the NTSC system, with 1080 interlaced lines, or 1125 lines in total. The development and implementation of this system was a methodical process. Satellite test broadcasts of this new high-definition format began about ten years later, in 1989. After these preliminary tests, a more regular testing schedule was initiated in 1991. The results of this period of extensive testing culminated in the start of regular broadcasting of BS-9ch on November 25, 1994. BS-9ch broadcast included both commercial programming and programming produced by NHK. So in summary, the seminal development of consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 aspect ratio was first undertaken by the Japanese state broadcaster NHK in 1979. This system was a significant leap forward in televisual technology, providing much higher resolution and enhanced picture quality compared to existing systems, albeit at the cost of requiring a higher bandwidth for transmission."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Article: One day, in an English class, the students are doing their lessons.

They give you a free session (which was really a pretty brief, weak session), and then try to get you to sign up for personalized training. I can't afford personalized training. Hell, I can barely afford the monthly membership. Before I had the meeting about the personalized training, they were really happy to see me every time I walked in. Someone from the staff made sure to come say hi to me every time I worked out. About a week later, after they ran their spiel and I turned them down, it was like I turned into a ghost. I'm not complaining; I'm glad they don't bother me anymore, but they shut down hardcore. I see the staff talk to some of the people there, but most of us just go about our sessions as if they can't see us. I've been a member for close to two years now. Not one staff member has even said so much as hello to me since I turned down their services.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

In Wisconsin, more compensation has been paid for dog losses than livestock. Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush.

The segment appeared two-and-a-half weeks after Jobs's passing, and less than 24 hours before Isaacson's biography hits bookshelves. Excerpts of the biography, which contains information derived from interviews with more than 100 individuals among his acquaintance, as well as some 40 interviews with Jobs himself, have already appeared at many media outlets. Below, we've identified some highlights from the transcript of Sunday evening's segment. You can watch the segment in full here. Jobs invited Isaacson to write his biography seven years ago. Isaacson thought the request \\"presumptuous and premature, since Jobs was still a young man.\\" What Isaacson didn't know at the time was that Jobs was about to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer. Isaacson describes Jobs as \\"petulant\\" and \\"brittle.\\" \\"He could be very, very mean to people at times. Whether it was to a waitress in a restaurant, or to a guy who had stayed up all night coding. … And you'd say, 'Why did you do that? Why weren't you nicer?' And he'd say, 'I really want to be with people who demand perfection. And this is who I am,\\" recalls Isaacson. Isaacson attributes much of Jobs's personality and drive to a few key moments in his childhood. Isaacson tells one anecdote involving the construction of a fence with his adoptive father Paul. \\"And [Paul] said, 'You got to make the back of the fence that nobody will see just as good looking as the front of the fence. Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you're dedicated to making something perfect.'\\" Jobs was also influenced by the Bay Area, and not just the Hewlett-Packard offices located nearby, but also its counter-culture spirit. \\"He was sort of a hippie-ish rebel kid, loved listening to Dylan music, dropped acid, but also he loved electronics,\\" Isaacson describes. He says that when Jobs worked at game-maker Atari they had to put him on the night shift because he walked around barefoot and never bathed, and so employees didn't want to work with him. Jobs took a seven-month leave from Atari to travel through India. His encounters there and with Zen Buddhism \\"really informed his design sense,\\" says Isaacson. \\"That notion that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication [came from that trip].\\" When Jobs returned, he began making a primitive computer for hobbyists in the garage of his parents with Steve Wozniak, Apple's other founder. They started with 1,300. By the time Jobs was 25 Apple was worth \\"maybe 50 million dollars,\\" Jobs said in a taped recording with Isaacson. \\"I knew I never had to worry about money again.\\" Jobs also had a natural disregard for authority, and felt that normal rules didn't apply to him, Isaacson explains. One manifestation of that principle was visible in a Mercedes sports coupe he owned, which he refused to put a license plate on. Isaacson says Jobs's house in Palo Alto is completely unremarkable. \\"[It's] a house on a normal street with a normal sidewalk. No big winding driveway. No big security fences,\\" Isaacson says. He recalls that Jobs said he \\"did not want to live that nutso lavish lifestyle that so many people do when they get rich.\\" Jobs did meet his biological father, who once ran a restaurant in Silicon Valley. But Jobs never revealed to his father who he was. \\"I was in that restaurant once or twice and I remember meeting the owner who was from Syria,\\" Jobs said on tape. \\"And it was most certainly [my father]. And I shook his hand and he shook my hand. And that’s all.\\" Jobs's cancer was discovered accidentally while he was being checked for kidney stones in 2004. A cat scan revealed a malignant tumor in his pancreas. Jobs delayed the operation for its removal for nine months while he tried a number of natural remedies first. By the time it was operated on, the cancer had spread to tissues around the pancreas. Isaacson says he believes Jobs regretted the delay. Through 2008, Jobs continued to receive secret cancer treatment even though he was telling everyone he had been cured. The cancer had spread to his liver by this time. In the last two-and-a-half years of his life, Jobs no longer wanted to go out or travel, but wanted to focus on the products he was building at Apple: namely, the iPhone and iPad. \\"I think he would've loved to have conquered television [as well],\\" says Isaacson. \\"He would love to make an easy-to-use television set. … But he started focusing on his family again as well. And it was a painful brutal struggle. And he would talk, often to me about the pain.\\" Jobs occasionally brought up the subject of death in their last meetings. \\"I saw my life as an arc and that it would end and compared to that nothing mattered,\\" Jobs said in a taped interview. \\"You’re born alone, you’re going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean what is it exactly is it that you have to lose Steve? You know? There’s nothing.\\" ||||| Steve Jobs: Revelations from a tech giant Steve Jobs was already gravely ill with cancer when he asked author Walter Isaacson to write his biography. Jobs told Isaacson to write a honest book - about his failings and his strengths. Steve Kroft reports. (CBS News) His products - the Mac, iPhone, iPad and others - forever changed the way we think about technology. But how should we think about the man behind them, Apple's hard-driving co-founder Steve Jobs? In the years before his death, Jobs granted biographer Walter Isaacson more than 40 interviews, many recorded on tape. The result, as Steve Kroft reveals in this two-part story, is a rich portrait of an extraordinary innovator, whose outsized talents were matched by very human limitations. The following script is from \\"Steve Jobs\\" which aired on Oct. 23, 2011. Seven years ago, Steve Jobs asked Walter Isaacson, a former editor of TIME Magazine, if he would write his biography. Isaacson, who has done books about Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein, thought the request presumptuous and premature, since Jobs was still a young man. What Isaacson didn't know at the time, and only a few people did, was that Jobs was about to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer and was feeling his mortality. It speaks to the secrecy with which Jobs conducted his life and his business, adding mystery to an already compelling figure. \\"60 Minutes\\" coverage: Steve Jobs Complete coverage: Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011 In 2009, with Jobs already gravely ill, Isaacson began the first of more than 40 interviews with him - the last was conducted a few weeks before his death. Some of them were tape recorded and you will hear parts of them tonight. \\"I have no skeletons in my closet that can't be allowed out,\\" Jobs said. And like a well-timed Apple launch, the book titled simply - \\"Steve Jobs\\" - will be in stores tomorrow just two-and-a-half weeks after he died. \\"60 Minutes Overtime\\": Steve Jobs: Family photo album \\"60 Minutes Overtime\\": What did Steve Jobs say about his rivals? When Walter Isaacson first began working on the book, which is published by Simon and Schuster, a division of CBS, Steve Jobs' wife, Laurene Powell, told him, \\"Be honest with his failings as well as his strengths. There are parts of his life and his personality that are extremely messy. You shouldn't whitewash it. I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully.\\" Walter Isaacson: He's not warm and fuzzy. And to do it, Isaacson interviewed more than 100 people - Jobs' friends, family, co-workers and competitors. Steve Kroft: I think it's a tough book. Isaacson: It's a book that's fair. I mean, this is a real human being. Kroft: He had lots of flaws. Isaacson: He was very petulant. He was very brittle. He could be very, very mean to people at times. Whether it was to a waitress in a restaurant, or to a guy who had stayed up all night coding, he could just really just go at them and say, \\"You're doin' this all wrong. It's horrible.\\" And you'd say, \\"Why did you do that? Why weren't you nicer?\\" And he'd say, \\"I really wanna be with people who demand perfection. And this is who I am.\\" Isaacson believes that much of it can be traced to the earliest years of his life, and to the fact that Jobs was born out of wedlock, given up by his birth parents, and adopted by a working class couple from Mountain View, California. Isaacson: Paul Jobs was a salt-of-the-earth guy who was a great mechanic. And he taught his son Steve how to make great things. And he--once they were building a fence. And he said, \\"You got to make the back of the fence that nobody will see just as good looking as the front of the fence. Even though nobody will see it, you will know, and that will show that you're dedicated to making something perfect.\\" Jobs always knew he was adopted, but it still had a profound effect on him. He told Isaacson this story from his early childhood during one of their many taped interviews: [Steve Jobs, audio: I was, I remember right here on the lawn, telling Lisa McMoylar from across the street that I was adopted. And she said, \\"So does that mean your real parents didn't want you?\\" Ooooh, lightning bolts went off in my head. I remember running into the house, I think I was like crying, asking my parents. And they sat me down and they said, \\"No, you don't understand. We specifically picked you out.\\"] ||||| Summary:","response":"The CBS News's 60 Minutes interview conducted with Walter Isaacson, the authorized biographer of Steve Jobs, provided a multifaceted view of Jobs's life, personality, and career. The conversation transpired seven years after Jobs invited Isaacson to write his biography. Isaacson initially thought Jobs's request as premature, given that Jobs was still in his prime. It was only later that Isaacson found out that Jobs was suffering from pancreatic cancer at the time. Isaacson characterizes Jobs as 'petulant' and 'brittle', whose harsh treatment of others was rooted in his quest for perfection. Many factors contributed to Jobs's drive and character, including his upbringing with his adoptive parents, the influence of the Bay Area's counter-culture, and foundational experiences like his time in India, where Isaacson believes Jobs developed a deep appreciation for simplicity. Jobs's entrepreneurial journey started in his parent's garage, where he and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak began building primitive computers for hobbyists. By the time Jobs was 25, Apple had already reached a valuation of approximately 50 million. Isaacson also noted Jobs's disregard for norms and rules, one instance of which includes his refusal to install a license plate on his Mercedes sports coupe. His personal life, exemplified by his ordinary house in Palo Alto and his unflashy lifestyle, contrasted starkly with his professional success. Several personal revelations were also touched on in the interview. Jobs met his Syrian biological father who ran a restaurant in Silicon Valley but never revealed his identity. His battle with cancer, accidentally discovered in 2004, significantly influenced the final years of his life. Jobs delayed surgery for almost nine months, opting to try natural remedies first, which led to the cancer spreading to surrounding tissues. This period was also marked by Jobs focusing more on his family, while also concentrating on key Apple products like the iPhone and iPad. In a broader profound reflection, Jobs expressed his philosophical feelings toward the end of his life. On his views about mortality, Jobs said \\"You're born alone, you're going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean what is it exactly is it that you have to lose Steve? You know? There's nothing.\\" His story is a blend of extraordinary innovation, significant human limitations, and lessons about life and death."},{"question":"Definition: A text is given in Malayalam.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site.

ADVERTISEMENT Forty-seven Democrats defied President Obama’s veto threat and backed the bill — enough to override a presidential veto given the six Democrats and two Republicans who missed the vote. The 47 Democrats who voted for the bill ranged from centrist Blue Dogs, vulnerable lawmakers in tough reelection races and even one member of leadership: Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), who heads House Democrats' communications efforts. Two Republicans voted against the bill: Reps. Walter Jones (N.C.) and Steve King (Iowa). The outcome suggests the House could override Obama if he vetoes the measure, although there's no guarantee that Democrats will side against the president if they are asked to sustain a veto. The big question is whether the House will get a chance at an override vote. The legislation will now go to the Senate, where it may face a tougher path to passage. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) vowed to block the House bill if it is considered by the upper chamber after the Thanksgiving recess. “The problem is not with refugees,” Reid said. “I don’t think we’ll be dealing with it over here.” When asked about the prospect of Obama vetoing the legislation, Reid said, “Don’t worry, it won’t get passed. Next question?” Democrats in the upper chamber have been divided over the issue, and both parties have their eyes on winning a Senate majority in next year’s elections. The House vote comes less than a week after at least 129 people were killed in the Paris terrorist attacks. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has claimed responsibility for the carnage, and is also a big factor in the wave of refugees from Iraq and Syria flowing into Europe. Fears that terrorists could enter the United States through the refugee program sparked the House bill, which moved quickly through the chamber. Obama has planned to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the United States. Reports that one of the Paris attackers entered Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee has further fanned the flames. The legislation would prevent any refugees from Syria or Iraq from entering the United States until the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence certify that none of them are dangerous. “If our law enforcement and our intelligence community cannot verify that each and every person is not a security threat, then they shouldn't be allowed in,” said Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanLawmakers shrug off shutdown drama Shutdown to drag on for days after Senate adjourns without deal Both sides play blame game on first day of shutdown MORE (R-Wis.). “We cannot and we should not wait to act. Not when our national security is at stake,” he added. Obama has engaged in an at times personal war of words with Republicans over the legislation, even as he continues a foreign trip. He argued that keeping out Syrian refugees fleeing terrorism and war in their country was an affront to American values. In a statement outlining its veto threat, the Obama administration argued the bill would “provide no meaningful additional security for the American people” and impose new certification requirements that effectively end the refugee program. “The United States has always been and should always be a place of refuge,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). “We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty.” Yet top administration officials, just hours before the vote, struggled to convince undecided House Democrats to oppose the bill. The Obama administration has said the vetting process typically already takes more than a year for each refugee. But FBI Director James Comey acknowledged in a hearing last month that certain gaps remain in the administration’s ability to fully vet each refugee applicant. If the bill is blocked in the Senate, House Republicans are already looking toward a catchall government spending bill, known as an omnibus, as their best leverage to force the Obama administration’s hand. Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said he would vote against a spending bill that doesn’t contain provisions halting the refugee program. “I think that we have to exert maximum leverage,” Salmon told The Hill. Those threats raise the possibility of a showdown over the issue that could lead to a government shutdown. Congress must pass legislation by Dec. 11 to keep the government open. Alexander Bolton and Scott Wong contributed. This story was updated at 3:52 p.m. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — In a stinging rebuke to President Barack Obama by Republicans as well as members of his own party, the House ignored a veto threat Thursday and overwhelmingly approved Republican legislation erecting fresh hurdles for Syrian and Iraqi refugees trying to enter the United States. Dozens of Democrats joined Republicans as the House passed the measure 289-137. That margin exceeded the two-thirds majority required to override a veto, and it came despite a rushed, early morning visit to the Capitol by top administration officials in a futile attempt to limit Democratic defections for the measure. Thursday's vote came six days after a burst of bombings and shootings in Paris killed 129 people, wounded many more and revived post-9/11 jitters in the U.S. and Europe. The attacks have turned the question of admitting people fleeing war-torn Syria and Iraq into a high-stakes political issue in both the United States and Europe, and many congressional Democrats were willing to vote against their party's lame duck president for fear of angering voters nervous about security at home. Democrats opposing the GOP bill said the U.S. has no business abandoning its age-old values, including being a safe haven for people fleeing countries racked by violence. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks and controls vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, despite a growing military campaign against them by the U.S. and other nations. \\"Defeating terrorism should not mean slamming the door in the faces of those fleeing the terrorists. We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty,\\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. Republicans said that in dangerous times, the government must first protect its own. \\"It is against the values of our nation and the values of a free society to give terrorists the opening they are looking for\\" by not tightening entry restrictions, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Before Thursday's House vote, the White House sent chief of staff Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to the Capitol to try winning over Democrats. Democratic aides said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., had a forceful exchange with Johnson, saying that opposition to the bill would be a terrible vote for Democrats that could cost them seats in next year's elections. With the House's 246 Republicans ready to solidly support the legislation, the administration was eager to keep the final tally for the bill below the two-thirds margin required to override a veto. In a sign of the conflicting political undercurrents confronting Democrats, senior House Democrats said they did not push rank-and-file lawmakers to oppose the bill. \\"I've said to them from the start, 'Nobody's asked you to do anything. Do whatever works for you, for your district,'\\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who opposed the legislation, told journalists. Freshman Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb., who faces a tough re-election fight next year, called the Paris attacks \\"a game changer\\" and supported the bill, saying, \\"I cannot sit back and ignore the concerns of my constituents and the American public.\\" The measure, which in effect would suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, would require the FBI to conduct background checks on people coming to the U.S. from those countries. It would oblige the heads of the FBI and Homeland Security Department and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that each refugee \\"is not a threat to the security of the United States.\\" On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. should welcome refugees from the region and bolster America's defenses and intelligence operations. On the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who hasn't yet scheduled debate on the issue, said Thursday it is time \\"to press pause\\" so policy makers could decide whether adequate vetting procedures are in place, calling it \\"the most responsible thing for the administration to do right now.\\" Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he's been disgusted in recent days by the comments from Republicans and called it \\"fear-mongering and bigotry.\\" In a statement assuring a veto, the White House said the GOP bill would not improve Americans' security. It said the legislation \\"would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.\\" Currently, the refugee screening process typically takes 18 to 24 months and includes interviews, fingerprinting and database crosschecks by several federal agencies. Syrians undergo additional screening involving data from the U.N. Refugee Agency and interviews by Homeland Security Department officials trained to question Syrians. The Obama administration wants to increase the 70,000 refugees to be admitted from around the world this year by 10,000, with much of the increase for Syrians. The White House said that of 2,174 Syrians admitted to the U.S. since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, none has been arrested or deported because of allegations they harbored extremist ambitions. ___ AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner and writers Andrew Taylor and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| AP Photo House approves Syrian refugees bill The bill sees near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats. The House passed a bill Thursday that would block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country unless they pass strict background checks — setting up a collision with President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats. The bill had near unanimous support from Republicans, who were joined by 47 Democrats — even after the Obama administration made a last-minute pitch to persuade wavering House Democrats to oppose the GOP-written bill. And with 289 \\"yes\\" votes, Republicans also won a veto-proof majority for the measure. Story Continued Below The bipartisan support was a rebuke of President Barack Obama by House Democrats who felt that the administration failed to make a compelling case as to why they should vote against the Republican-authored bill when it was bad politics to do so. “I think a lot of us went in with open minds and really wanted to understand the administration’s position on this,” said New York Democrat Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. “It is offensive to me that we would stigmatize refugees…but if you read the bill what you find is that you have a pretty simple certification process sitting on top of an existing and extensive screening process that most of us believe works pretty well.” Maloney voted for the bill. The vote was a significant loss for the White House — perhaps the biggest setback since most of the House Democratic Caucus voted against Obama on a trade bill in mid-June. Thursday’s vote, coupled with the Iranian nuclear agreement bill from September, also shows that Republicans plan to make national security a key issue in the 2016 elections. The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pledged Thursday that the Syria bill won’t make it to Obama’s desk. Senators will likely attempt to tack the measure as a rider to the government spending bill that Congress has to address in December. “We’ve explained here in some detail [that] the problem is not with refugees. I haven’t read the House language,” Reid said during a press conference on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to be dealing with it over here.” Already conservative House Republicans are signaling they won’t vote to support December’s so-called omnibus bill unless it includes beefed-up provisions for vetting Syrian refugees while Democrats in the House are calling for a budget bill free of all contentious policy riders. The final 289- 137 vote was expected as House Democrats began signaling early Thursday there was not broad support in their caucus to take a tough vote on national security. In response, the White House dispatched chief of staff Denis McDonough and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to speak with Democrats just hours before the House vote. It was clear, lawmakers said, that the White House is trying to keep the number of Democratic defections low. But Multiple sources said McDonough and Johnson's \\"in the weeds\\" presentation didn't receive wide support in the room. The administration officials tried to make the case that the current vetting system was enough and that the Department of Homeland Security found the process too burdensome under the Republican-authored bill. That message fell hard with Democrats. Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), who voted for the bill, said he not swayed by Johnson’s pitch to Democrats that the Homeland Security Department doesn’t have time to certify refugees. “If you look at the bill, it’s hard to see how it’s as awful as the administration is portraying it as,” Peters said. Sources said Maloney pushed back against the White House, saying the issue is \\"toxic\\" — even if Democrats oppose the Republican bill on policy grounds — because of the complicated messaging surrounding the national security issue. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas also questioned whether the opposition from the White House was wise for rank-and-file members of the caucus. Rep. Gerry Connolly said White House officials didn't make an effective pitch during the meeting with Democrats. He urged them to drop their opposition to the Republican bill. \\"It's one more assurance that those coming into the country are screened,\\" the Virginia Democrat said of the GOP-sponsored measure. \\"That seems to me not an imprudent measure under the circumstances.\\" House Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to oppose the legislation but did not formally whip colleagues. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made an informal whip count Wednesday night to gauge where the caucus is. \\"Nobody is asking you to do anything but listen,\\" Pelosi told lawmakers during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to sources in the room. Before the vote, Pelosi, who voted against the GOP bill, said the current process is sufficiently thorough. “The process that is currently in place is thorough and robust and long as it is fully implemented and not diluted…it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees while protecting the American people,” the California Democrat said on the floor. Pelosi did push for Democrats to support a procedural move known as a motion to recommit. That move — essentially a Democratic alternative — would require the Department of Homeland Security only to certify that refugees have passed requirement standards. It was drafted by Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on a Judiciary subcommittee tasked with immigration. The Republican legislation, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, would require the FBI, Homeland Security Department and director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that any refugee from Syria or Iraq is \\"not a threat to the security of the United States\\" before being allowed to settle in the United States. President Barack Obama has proposed allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the country this year, part of the Western response to the wave of millions of refugees fleeing that country's bloody civil war and Islamic State-related violence. The White House has threatened to veto the measure. |||||","response":"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that could prevent Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the US unless they pass strict background checks. The bill had near unanimous support from Republicans, and also gained the support of 47 Democrats, after the Obama administration made a last minute pitch to persuade wavering House Democrats to oppose the GOP-written bill. The White House has warned it will veto the bill, however with 289 \\"yes\\" votes, Republicans won a veto-proof majority for the measure. How refugees are to be screened is set to become a key issue in the 2016 elections."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: Generate an overlapping word between the given two sentences.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Where did Anna's terminally-ill mother die? Movie plot title: The Uninvited Movie plot: Anna (Emily Browning) has been in a psychiatric institution for ten months, following her suicide attempt after her terminally ill mother died in a boathouse fire. Upon her discharge, she has no memory of the event but frequently suffers related nightmares. While packing, Anna is startled by a disturbing, talkative patient from the room across the hall. Shortly after, she leaves with her father, Steven (David Strathairn), a writer who has dedicated his latest book to Anna and her sister. At home, Anna reunites with her sister, Alex (Arielle Kebbel), with whom she is very close. The sisters stand against Steven's girlfriend Rachel (Elizabeth Banks), who had been their mother's live-in nurse. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls' mother was still alive and sick in bed but he does not respond. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that the hallucinations are messages from their mother, telling them that she was murdered by Rachel. Anna catches up with her old boyfriend, Matt (Jesse Moss), who tells her that he saw what happened the night of the fire. They secretly plan to meet that night, but Matt fails to show up and Anna returns home. In her room, Anna awakens to find him climbing into her window, saying that she needs to know the truth and that he had a warning from her mother. They kiss but then Anna notices Matt's body suddenly warping and his back breaking. Anna flees from the room in fear but when she opens the door, he is gone. The next morning, Matt's dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken just the way Anna saw it. The police assume he fell and drowned. The sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the State Nursing Association and conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the three children she looked after because she had an obsession with their widowed father. They try to warn their father, but he ignores their concerns and leaves for work. The girls...

Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He is running on the tread mill in the gym\\" - Sentence B: \\"He is running on the cycle in the gym\\"","response":"Sentence B: \\"He is running on the cycle in the gym\\" is against common sense. Explanation: Sentence A describes a person running on a treadmill, which is an appropriate and common activity at a gym. Treadmills are designed specifically for walking, jogging, or running in place, making this sentence logical and in line with common sense. Sentence B, however, describes a person running on a cycle. In a gym context, \\"cycle\\" typically refers to a stationary bike, which is designed for cycling or pedaling while seated. Running on a cycle is not only an improper use of the equipment but also something that defies common sense because it would not provide the intended exercise benefits and may lead to potential accidents and injuries.

What is the Probability that A and D do not sit together if all 10 sit around a circular table? Options: (A) 2/9 (B) 2/5 (C) 7/9 (D) 4/5 (E) 8/9","response":"We'll use the principle of complementary probability to solve this problem. Instead of finding the probability that A and D do not sit together directly, we'll find the probability that they sit together and then subtract it from 1. Step 1: Since there are 10 students sitting around a circular table, there are 9! (9 factorial) arrangements. This is because we can treat the table as fixed, and align the students as though they were positioned in a row, with 9 remaining spots. Step 2: Now, we will find the number of arrangements in which A and D sit together. To do this, we will treat A and D as a single pair. This means we now have a total of 9 units sitting around the table: 8 students plus the pair of A and D. Step 3: The number of arrangements for the 9 units sitting around the circular table would be (9-1)!, which is 8!. Within the pair, A and D can switch positions, leading to 2! arrangements. So, the total arrangements when A and D sit together would be 2! x 8!. Step 4: Now, we will find the probability that A and D sit together. Divide the number of A and D sitting together arrangements by the total possible arrangements: (2! x 8!) / 9! = (2 x 8!) / 9! = 2/9 Step 5: Finally, we'll determine the probability that A and D do NOT sit together using complementary probability: P(A and D do not sit together) = 1 - P(A and D sit together) = 1 - 2/9 = 7/9 Therefore, the answer is (C) 7/9."},{"question":"Budeme Derek Fisher a Lebron James!

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable. Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough. Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors. Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills. The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas. When you feel that they are old enough, let them write their ideas on a piece of paper and you can pick an idea that you find practical. That way, every day can be fun!

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier. By December 31, 1991, the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation, and individual republics assumed the central government's role.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"Individual republics took over for the central government before Russian deputies were recalled. In the given context, it is evident that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was a gradual process marked by several critical events leading to the eventual disintegration of the central government. The Russian authorities took over Gorbachev's former office suite on December 26, 1991, two days before Yeltsin officially moved into the office. This indicates that individual republics, in this case, Russia, had already begun assuming responsibilities previously held by the central government. The recall of Russian deputies was another significant event in the decline of the Soviet Union. The context states that the Council of the Union, a chamber of the Supreme Soviet, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies had left it without a quorum. This event occurred after individual republics began taking over the central government's role. In summary, the process of individual republics assuming the duties of the central government had already commenced before the recall of Russian deputies. It was these collective actions and the diminishing power of the central government that led to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union."},{"question":"Answer this question. What island in the Caribbean is divided between France and the Netherlands?","response":"The island in the Caribbean that is divided between France and the Netherlands is Saint Martin, also known as Sint Maarten in Dutch. Saint Martin is a unique and fascinating destination, as it is the smallest landmass in the world to be shared by two sovereign nations - France and the Netherlands. Located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Saint Martin is part of the Leeward Islands in the West Indies. Covering an area of approximately 87 square kilometers (34 square miles), the island is divided almost evenly between the two nations, with the French side occupying the northern region and the Dutch side occupying the southern region. The French side, known as Saint-Martin, covers an area of around 53 square kilometers (20 square miles) and is governed as a part of the overseas collectivity of France. The capital of the French side is Marigot, a charming town that exudes a distinctly European vibe with its French bakeries, bistros, and boutiques. On the other side of the island is the Dutch-ruled region, called Sint Maarten, which spans over approximately 34 square kilometers (13 square miles). The Dutch side is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and its capital is Philipsburg. Sint Maarten tends to have a more energetic and vibrant atmosphere, with numerous casinos, bars, and resorts. The island's unique governance presents a harmonious coexistence between the French and Dutch cultures, which is referred to as the \\"Unity and Concord.\\" Despite the borders between the two territories, residents and visitors are permitted to travel freely between both sides of the island without needing a passport or visa for border-crossings. Saint Martin is a popular travel destination, offering picturesque beaches, crystal clear waters, and a plethora of activities such as snorkeling, hiking, and zip-lining. Additionally, the island is known for its rich culinary scene, featuring a fusion of French, Dutch, and Caribbean cuisine, often referred to as the \\"cuisine capital of the Caribbean.\\" The island's history dates back to the earliest Arawak people who settled in the area around 3,500 years ago. European discovery and colonization began with Columbus' second voyage to the Americas in 1493. Over the centuries, control of Saint Martin changed hands between the Spanish, Dutch, and French, before the French and Dutch eventually agreed in 1648 to peacefully divide and share the island in the Treaty of Concordia. Today, Saint Martin presents a unique and enchanting blend of European and Caribbean cultures, providing visitors and locals with a one-of-a-kind escape from the ordinary."},{"question":"Jim Mullen has written to Scottish League Managers Association head Alex Smith after he described it as \\"undignified and unfair\\".

If not, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie.

During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. I am facing a new situation today: Pat and Tammy are mother and sister. They like to take long walks together. Pat is 60, while Tammy is 32 years-old. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person has reached middle adulthood? Answer:","response":"Based on the information provided in the background article, middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. In the new situation, Pat is 60 years old and Tammy is 32 years old. Since Pat falls within the age range of middle adulthood, the correct answer to the question is that Pat has reached middle adulthood. Tammy, at 32 years old, has not yet reached middle adulthood, as she is still in her early 30s."},{"question":"Come up with a question and stream of consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: trauma","response":"Question: What are the underlying psychological factors that can significantly impact a person's emotional and mental well-being after experiencing a distressing or life-threatening event? Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the various factors influencing a person's well-being, we must examine the context of their life experiences. A significant event that often has long-lasting effects on an individual's emotional and mental state is the experience of trauma. Trauma can stem from various distressing and life-threatening situations, including abuse, accidents, violence, or natural disasters. The impacts of trauma are not limited to the time it occurs; it can cause severe emotional and mental repercussions even years later. An individual may experience symptoms such as anxiety, intrusive memories, depression, and a heightened sense of fear or vulnerability. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a specific condition that may develop after these experiences, further demonstrating the complexities of trauma and its lasting effects on mental health. Understanding how trauma shapes a person's emotional and mental well-being is crucial to providing appropriate care and addressing its long-term consequences."},{"question":"The Young Moguls Megan Ellison, the 26-year-old daughter of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, is part of a new crop of young, deep-pocketed Hollywood financiers who are changing the way movies get made today. Erica Orden has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images. When directorPaul Thomas Anderson began working on \\"The Master,\\" a thinly veiled critique of Scientology, he proposed shooting it on 65-millimeter film—a costly option that delivers unusual depth and clarity. Rather than seeking clearance from a phalanx of movie studio executives, Mr. Anderson needed to convince only one person: 26-year-old Megan Ellison. Ms. Ellison, the daughter of billionaire Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, single-handedly financed the 42 million project and signed off on the request without hesitation. \\"Most studios now, you have to fight to shoot something on film,\\" says Daniel Lupi, who produced the film with Ms. Ellison. She said, \\"'Great, let's do it.' Basically, all of the decision making is with her.\\" Over the past two years, Ms. Ellison has emerged as an important source of financing for Hollywood's most high-profile, and high-risk, projects.Through her independent company Annapurna Pictures, she fully financed \\"The Master\\" as well as the 45 million \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" the film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden that is nominated for five Academy Awards. She backed this year's Prohibition-era drama \\"Lawless,\\" and has movies in the pipeline from directors including Spike Jonze, David O. Russell and Bennett Miller. She is also reviving \\"The Terminator,\\" one of the most lucrative film franchises ever, paying 20 million for the right to make future installments and signing Arnold Schwarzenegger to star. Ms. Ellison is part of a new crop of young scions with deep pockets who are changing the way Hollywood makes movies. Among the others: Teddy Schwarzman, the 33-year-old son of billionaire Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman; Michael Benaroya, the 31-year-old son of a prominent Seattle-based real-estate family; John P. Middleton, the 29-year-old son of Philadelphia Phillies part-owner John S. Middleton; and Ms. Ellison's 30-year-old brother, David, whose company has a 350 million co-financing deal with Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures. The younger heirs join Jamie Patricof, 37, son of a private-equity pioneer, and Andrew Lauren, 43, son of designer Ralph Lauren, who are also involved in film production. David Ellison flying a plane for the film 'Flyboys.' The road to Hollywood is littered with wealthy young financiers who lost their fortunes in starry-eyed quests to make movies. Newcomers with money \\"can tap out quickly because if you're not smart about it, it's a very expensive game,\\" says \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" director David O. Russell, whose next movie, about a 1970s FBI sting, is backed by Ms. Ellison. What distinguishes today's crop, and in particular Ms. Ellison, is the depth of their pockets. On her 25th birthday, Ms. Ellison gained access to as much as 2 billion of her father's fortune, according to people familiar with the matter. The new Hollywood investors are also determined to be less star-struck and more practical with their checkbooks. \\"The idea is for dumb money to be smarter,\\" said Mr. Schwarzman, who founded Black Bear Pictures at the start of 2011. His company's first major theatrical release, \\"Broken City,\\" about a former police officer (Mark Wahlberg) hired to investigate the wife of a New York City mayor (Russell Crowe), opens Friday. Mr. Schwarzman says his company has made a concerted effort to avoid the appearance of dilettantism. For instance, Black Bear has a formal policy that it will respond to all scripts within a week. \\"It's bringing a diligence and respect to the process that we think is deserved,\\" he says. Megan Ellison, far left, with colleagues from 'Zero Dark Thirty,' which she produced. The argument for why these producers are a boon to Hollywood is that they are filling a void. In recent years, major studios have largely shuttered their art-house divisions, concentrating instead on producing big-budget, special effects-laden movies which have a higher likelihood of big returns at the global box office. Even when studios do get involved in serious dramas or smart comedies, they often try to limit their risk by partnering with financiers or buying films after they're finished, in what is called a negative pickup deal. Meanwhile, banks, where independent producers once turned to finance their films, have backed away from lending for projects with questionable returns. That leaves an opening for the new batch of producers who can pick up the tabs for ambitious, small- and mid-budget movies that can be financially risky but offer potentially rewarding payoffs. \\"I think we're in a really good time for opportunistic financiers,\\" said Mr. Benaroya, whose Benaroya Pictures produced 2011's \\"Margin Call,\\" starring Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons and made for 3.5 million. \\"There's not a ton of money out there, especially not equity, and there's not a lot of people who are writing significant checks for independent film.\\" Mr. Benaroya said he emphasizes sensible budgets and making effective use of tax credits and foreign pre-sales. Over the next two years, Mr. Benaroya's company plans to release more than half a dozen films, including a drama starring Kristen Wiig and Guy Pearce. Ms. Ellison's brother, David, gravitates toward big budget mass-market Hollywood fare. His recent films include the Tom Cruise vehicles \\"Jack Reacher\\" and \\"Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol.\\" He will executive produce the latest installment of the Star Trek franchise, \\"Star Trek Into Darkness,\\" set for release in May. Director Paul Thomas Anderson and Joaquin Phoenix on the set of 'The Master,' produced by Ms. Ellison. Even within this rarefied group, Ms. Ellison stands out for her staggering wealth: Her father's net worth is 41 billion, according to Forbes, making him the third-richest American, trailing only Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. \\"She's in a different financial stratosphere than the rest of us,\\" said Mr. Benaroya. Beyond her lavish budget, Ms. Ellison's willingness to take on creatively ambitious but risky material regardless of its profit potential has caught the attention of many filmmakers. With no formal business education and very little filmmaking training—she spent less than a year at the University of Southern California film school before dropping out—she nevertheless calls the shots on projects herself. In a famously flashy industry, Ms. Ellison shuns red-carpet glamour. Her signature look, even in business meetings—a vintage T-shirt emblazoned with an AC/DC or Led Zeppelin logo—is invariably one of the first things any studio executive mentions when discussing her. She avoids Hollywood hangouts like the Beverly Hills Hotel and Chateau Marmont, and attends her own premieres in a demure black pantsuit and flats (or sometimes Converse sneakers). She has never granted a formal interview and declined to comment for this article. \\"You would never know that Megan Ellison, if you met her on the street, is behind all of these films,\\" said Mark Duplass, the actor and director who has a brief role in \\"Zero Dark Thirty.\\" \\"Your first guess would be that she'd be hanging out at a 7-Eleven, smoking with her friends—and that she might ask you to buy beer for her.\\" Whether Ms. Ellison can translate her taste in movies into a viable business remains to be seen. She is known to offer directors generous terms that can jeopardize a film's profitability. She also tends to grant coveted \\"final cut\\" privileges to filmmakers to entice them to work with her, a liberty that can frustrate distributors. \\"The Master\\"—distributed by Weinstein Co., which has released three of her films—has earned just 16 million at the domestic box office. It cost about 42 million to make, according to people familiar with its budget. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Ellison says it cost closer to 32 million.) Some of her other films have fared better. \\"Lawless,\\" starring Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf and written by Nick Cave, took in 37.4 million in domestic box office receipts on a budget of 26 million. Ms. Ellison financed two-thirds of the film. But getting \\"Lawless\\" into profitable shape was a struggle. After Weinstein Co. executives and other producers on the film first viewed a cut, they decided it needed to be re-edited. Ms. Ellison resisted the suggested changes, arguing that director John Hillcoat's cut shouldn't be altered, according to people familiar with the matter. Weinstein executives ultimately won out, these people said. With \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" Ms. Ellison's biggest bet to date, she appears likely to turn a profit. The movie grossed 24 million in its first weekend in wide release, with 34.7 million in cumulative domestic earnings. The distributor, Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures, expects it to bring in more than 90 million. Still, the movie is a significant gamble. Ms. Ellison is on the hook for the entire budget, although she has recouped some of it through foreign presales. The film's prospects are complicated by a national debate about whether it condones the use of torture as an interrogation technique, as well as whether it falsely depicts torture as having produced information that resulted in the CIA's ability to locate bin Laden. While director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal won Academy Awards for directing and writing 2008's \\"The Hurt Locker,\\" they are also famous for making the lowest-grossing film to ever win a best picture Oscar. That distinction didn't deter Ms. Ellison, who last week became one of the youngest producers to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. \\"A lot of financial entities would have backed the film but demanded a more vanilla product in exchange for this risk,\\" Mr. Boal said. At the movie's premiere in Los Angeles in December, Ms. Ellison shied away from the party's glitterati, lingering with the smokers on the patio. Meanwhile, her father held court by the bar, engaging in a boisterous conversation with actor Jason Clarke, who plays a CIA agent in the film. Her indifference to business formalities occasionally surfaces, such as Annapurna's notice on its website that it doesn't accept unsolicited material, for \\"very super-boring legal reasons.\\" When Ms. Bigelow failed to secure an Oscar nomination, Ms. Ellison took to her Twitter account, which is typically populated by inspirational quotations from Shel Silverstein or Muhammad Ali, to declare: \\"Kathryn Bigelow was robbed. So f— up.\\" Ms. Ellison's office is a \\"hippie palace,\\" as a recent visitor put it, a compound of homes nestled in the Hollywood Hills. Employees of Annapurna work out of two houses, both with sweeping views of Los Angeles. (One of the homes is on the market for 15.5 million.) When her filmmakers are finished shooting, they sometimes come to the complex to complete work on their movie in postproduction. The process is often a relief to directors like Mr. Jonze, who is finishing his next movie, \\"Her,\\" starring Joaquin Phoenix, with Ms. Ellison now. Mr. Jonze's last feature film, \\"Where the Wild Things Are,\\" spent years mired in development at a major studio, Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. Pictures. His experience with Ms. Ellison has been a sharp departure. \\"I finished the script, I sent it to her, she said she wanted to make it,\\" Mr. Jonze recalled. \\"It feels really simple, working at this company.\\" A version of this article appeared January 17, 2013, on page D1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: THE YOUNG MOGULS.

Nigel Farage said the money would be given to charity Ukip faced a new race row last night over a £28,000 gift from a pensioner branded ‘evil’ by a judge for giving a bomb-making recipe to a man who attacked immigrants’ homes, writes Simon Walters. Allen Boyce received a two-year suspended jail sentence for handing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist who was jailed for a race-hate campaign against Asian families in Eastbourne. Details of political donations published last week show that Boyce, a National Front parade bugler, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. He told OPTIONS: - Allen Boyce how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Asian how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - BNP how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Boyce how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - British National Party how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Eastbourne how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - National Front how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Nigel Farage how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Simon Walters how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. - Ukip how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived.","response":"He told Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived. This revelation raises questions about the legitimacy of Boyce's donation to Ukip, as his actions had led to significant harm and fear within the immigrant community. His involvement in providing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist like Collins, who actively pursued a campaign against Asian families, highlights his connection to extremist far-right ideologies. Considering the judge's branding of Boyce as \\"evil,\\" it is crucial for Ukip to carefully consider the implications of accepting and utilizing the £28,416 left by Boyce. Nigel Farage has already stated that the money would be given to charity. However, Ukip must ensure that the charity or cause receiving these funds is appropriate and promotes compassion, inclusivity, and community-building, as an effort to counteract the damage done by Boyce's actions. In taking these steps, Ukip can demonstrate that they do not support individuals like Boyce and are dedicated to promoting an inclusive society. Furthermore, by transparently reporting on the allocation of Boyce's donation, Ukip can also build trust with the public and showcase accountability in their political and financial dealings. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the passage considers Terry Collins as the recipient of Boyce's instructions. This reveals the severity of Boyce's actions and the importance of Ukip's responsibility to handle the donation ethically and transparently."},{"question":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Submitting Assignment Online In order to upload an assignment (work given to students) to the system properly, you must save the assignment using one of the following applications: Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect, or Microsoft Excel.

Generate a detailed description of this data","response":"The provided data contains specific information about an astronomical object, 101 Helena. To better understand the data, let's break down each piece of information and discuss them in detail. 1. Density of 101 Helena: The first data point is the density of 101 Helena, which is given as 2.0 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). In the context of celestial bodies, density refers to the mass per unit volume, which quantifies how compressed or packed together the substance that makes up the object is. A higher density typically implies a more compact and closely packed object, while a lower density indicates a looser, more sparse configuration. In comparison to Earth's average density of 5.52 g/cm³, 101 Helena's density is much lower, which suggests that it might be composed of lighter elements and/or less compressed materials. 2. Escape velocity of 101 Helena: The second data point states that 101 Helena has an escape velocity of 0.0348 kilometers per second (km/s). Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of a celestial body. The greater the escape velocity, the stronger the gravitational force exerted by the body, which makes it more difficult for objects to escape its gravitational field. A lower escape velocity signifies weaker gravity. For reference, the escape velocity on Earth is about 11.19 km/s, which means that 101 Helena has a considerably weaker gravitational pull on objects in its vicinity. 3. Apoapsis of 101 Helena: Lastly, the apoapsis of 101 Helena is provided as 441,092,000 kilometers (km). In astronomy, apoapsis refers to the point in the orbit of an object around a celestial body at which the distance between them is greatest. This distance is often used to describe the shape and size of an object's orbit. The given apoapsis distance of 101 Helena suggests that its orbit is rather large, and may also indicate that it is an object of the main asteroid belt formed between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. In conclusion, the provided data offers an overview of various characteristics of the astronomical object, 101 Helena, including its density, escape velocity, and distance at apoapsis. This data can be useful in understanding the physical properties, composition and the position 101 Helena occupies in our solar system."},{"question":"This is an email Kamp, I think you have to give up on your dream of being a game show host.

In life , the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by the physical senses of pleasure , pain , sight and sound . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","response":"These two sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other to an extent, but they convey slightly different ideas and emphasis when compared. Let's break down each sentence to understand the subtle differences. Sentence 1: \\"In life , the bodily functions of the soul are restricted by rational and intelligent senses of pleasure , pain , sight , and sound .\\" This sentence suggests that the soul possesses bodily functions that are limited by the rational and intelligent dimensions of our senses, including pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. The focus here is on the bodily functions of the soul being confined due to these higher cognitive aspects of our senses. Sentence 2: \\"In life , the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by the physical senses of pleasure , pain , sight and sound .\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the rational and intelligent functions of the soul, which are portrayed as being limited by the physical aspects of our senses, including pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. The emphasis here is on the higher cognitive aspects of the soul being held back by the physical nature of the senses. While both sentences describe limitations imposed on the soul by the interaction between the senses and the soul, the first sentence highlights the restriction of soul's bodily functions due to the rational and intelligent aspects of our senses. The second sentence emphasizes the restriction of the soul's rational and intelligent functions due to the physical aspects of our senses. In summary, these sentences can be seen as paraphrases in the sense that they both explore the limitations of the soul and its functions related to senses. However, the way they emphasize different aspects of the soul's functions and the senses is what sets them apart, making them not entirely equivalent in their meaning."},{"question":"If To make sure the message is clear, Paris offers golden nighttime illumination of its major historical buildings., can we conclude that \\"Paris makes their landmarks really stand out to show what a special city it is. \\"?

With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Papal conclave of October 1978 was triggered by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign for at least a decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtya, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name of \\"John Paul II\\". - Karol : A Man Who Became Pope ( pl : Karol - Czowiek , który zosta Papieem , it : Karol , un uomo diventato Papa ) is a 2005 TV miniseries directed by Giacomo Battiato , and created as a Polish - Italian - French - German and Canadian joint cooperation project . Karol is a biography of Karol Wojtya , later known as Pope John Paul II , beginning in 1939 when Karol was only 19 years old and ending at the Papal conclave , October 1978 that made him Pope . The TV miniseries was supposed to première at the very beginning of April 2005 in the Vatican , but it was delayed due to the Pope 's death . It was broadcast for the first time by the Italian television station Canale 5 on the first day of the 2005 papal election . Although it was originally broadcast on television , it was also released in theaters , which allowed the film to be shown in Poland . The incredible success of the movie prompted the creation of a sequel , Karol : The Pope , The Man ( 2006 ) , which portrayed Karol 's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death . - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani (17 October 191228 September 1978), served as Pope from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later. His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, ending a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. He was declared a Servant of God by his successor, Pope John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope. The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years, and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'filming location'.

Here is a hypothesis: She is going out with Kluk because he is rich. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"Okay, little buddy, let me explain it to you. A premise is like a little fact we know, and a hypothesis is a smart guess we make from that fact. The fact, or premise, we have is that she's seeing an oil magnate named Kluk. The guess, or hypothesis, is she's going out with Kluk because he is rich. Now, we can't say for sure that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must be true as well. People can go out with each other for different reasons, like how much they enjoy hanging out together or how much they care for each other. So, just because Kluk is rich doesn't mean that's the only reason she's going out with him.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in..., what would be the answer ?

For this example, let's select the impact of social media on mental health. This topic is relevant in today's digital age and has been the subject of numerous studies. Step 2: Define the context Based on the topic, the context can be defined as: \\"In recent years, social media platforms have become an integral part of people's daily lives, allowing for unprecedented connection and communication opportunities. Several studies have suggested that there might be a correlation between the use of social media and people's mental health.\\" Step 3: Research the topic To create an informed hypothesis, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the topic. Reading about recent studies, expert opinions, and various perspectives on social media's impact on mental health will help generate a more educated guess about what might be true. Step 4: Identify trends and patterns After researching, patterns may emerge, such as a correlation between increased social media use and higher rates of anxiety or depression. Note any trends or connections observed between the topic and mental health to help narrow down the focus. Step 5: Develop the hypothesis With a clear understanding of the topic, context, and patterns, it's time to create a hypothesis. A hypothesis should be a testable statement that can be either supported or refuted by empirical evidence. In this case, the hypothesis could be: \\"Frequent usage of social media platforms, particularly those that focus on image sharing, is positively correlated with increased feelings of depression and anxiety amongst users.\\" Now, we have both the context and the hypothesis: Context: \\"In recent years, social media platforms have become an integral part of people's daily lives, allowing for unprecedented connection and communication opportunities. Several studies have suggested that there might be a correlation between the use of social media and people's mental health.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Frequent usage of social media platforms, particularly those that focus on image sharing, is positively correlated with increased feelings of depression and anxiety amongst users.\\""},{"question":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

Grace Coddington, for one. David and Sybil Yurman. Carolyn Murphy. Craig McDean. And a smattering of East Hampton habitués with names like Bunny and Pip. “It’s a mixture of grit and glory,” Eric Firestone told me (was he referring to the crowd?). We were standing near a massive Harley Davidson motorcycle, half disintegrated and enclosed in a light-lined cube. Mirrored glass sides reflected the bike endlessly through the box. Call it Tricolour Cockade, by Anthony James, who has a history of this type of work (see also: the torched Ferrari Spider 355 piece ΚΘ). The bike formed the centerpiece to the latest show at Firestone’s East Hampton gallery. “Parts and Service,” an exhibition of automotive photographs and mixed-media works, reflects on motorcycle culture and other vehicular fetishes. Think outlaw biker romanticism (Marlon Brando in The Wild One), the proto-American exuberance of the bracket-race circuit, the silent noir mysticism of immobile cars in lonely fields. Pinups, too, of a sort. Standout among the work is a photograph by Slater Bradley of a beautiful blonde shot at 2.5 lifesize and haloed in gold. Bradley’s work in film has earned him much acclaim, but Perfect Empathy (Alina), part of his series of hand-altered photographs of nude women with gilded backgrounds, shows how talented the New York-based artist is with what he has called his first love—still photography. “How old do you think she is?” a guy named Joel asked as we contemplated Alina’s visage. He seemed a bit mesmerized. (Twenty-one when the photo was taken—she lives in Germany now, alas.) If you go, spend some time absorbing Liz Cohen’s Southwest Hannah, Max Snow’s untitled silk-screen of a woman half inside a Lumina, McDean’s Burnout Two shot of an orange smoked monster on the track. (McDean is known for his fashion photographs but the guy is a voracious enthusiast of muscle cars and motorbikes.) It was a casual night, part of East Hampton’s regular art walk evenings held during the summer. That’s the great thing about art in the Hamptons, and the reason Firestone can pull such a varied crowd: Rainy Saturday nights in Water Mill or Sag Harbor offer only so much stimulation, so a gallery opening with a few friends in fashion, art and design sounds enticing. Everyone knows everyone here, anyway. After a drink and a smoke, downtown kids and the gallery crew filed out onto the street determined not to let a brief shower dampen spirits. We piled into Porsche’s grand Panamera S for a post-show clam bake on the beach. Firestone served rose on his own label; a bonfire and fireworks helped everything immensely. Eric Firestone Gallery presents “Parts and Service” through September 2nd.

In fact, despite demonstrations and a slew of online petitions (like this, this, and this) aimed at getting Nestlé to stop what it's doing, the company would, in a perfect world, boost the 700 million gallons of water it now uses. \\"If I could increase it, I would,\\" says Tim Brown, who heads Nestlé Waters North America, in an interview with radio station KPCC. \\"The fact is, if I stop bottling water tomorrow, people would buy another brand of bottled water. We feel good about what we're doing, delivering healthy hydrating to people throughout the state of California,\\" he said, per the Guardian. (In the same interview, NASA JPL's top water scientist points out that bottling water requires as much as 50% more water than turning on the tap.) Brown says Nestlé wastes some 30% of the groundwater it draws from the state, but the company this week announced plans to cut that figure by 12% at its Bakersfield and Tulare bottling facilities—two of five in the state—for a savings of 26 million gallons. That isn't nearly enough to help combat \\"the worst drought we've seen in a long time,\\" says charity Food & Water Watch. \\"It's irresponsible of the state to allow Nestlé to bottle water that's supposed to be a public resource,\\" a rep says. \\"We're calling for a moratorium on bottling water for private profit.\\" In an editorial for the San Bernardino County Sun in late April, Brown argued that \\"bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought\\" and noted that the 700 million gallons Nestlé uses \\"is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses.\\" (Another big company is similarly under fire.) Expand this summary.","response":"Sure, let's break this down into smaller bits. The company Starbucks was under a lot of pressure because they were taking water from California, which doesn't have a lot of it, to put in their bottled water. They eventually stopped doing that. However, Nestlé, another company that does the same thing, has said that they won't stop. Even though a lot of people are really upset with Nestlé and want them to stop taking California's water, the head of Nestlé's water business in North America, Tim Brown, said that they would even like to take more if they could. He said that even if Nestlé stop selling bottled water, people would start buying from another brand. He believes that they are doing good by providing a healthy drink to people. On the other hand, a top water scientist from NASA JPL explained that putting water in bottles uses up to 50% more water than just getting water from a tap. Right now, out of all the water they take from the ground, about 30% of it goes to waste. But Nestlé has announced that they want to improve that by wasting 12% less water at two of their five factories in California. They say this will save 26 million gallons of water. But some people, like a group called Food & Water Watch, say that this isn't enough. They say that California is in a really bad drought, which means there's a lot less water than normal. Because of this, they think it's wrong for Nestlé to be taking water that should be for everyone and putting it in bottles to sell it. They want to stop companies from selling bottled water for profit. In response to this, Tim Brown wrote that bottled water is not the cause of the drought. He said that the amount of water Nestlé uses is about the same as what two golf courses in California would use in a year. That was quite a lot of information, but I hope it now makes more sense to you, kiddo!"},{"question":"How does one withdraw from Quora? What does it take to unsubscribe from Quora?

With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \\"flows,\\" that objects \\"move through,\\" or that is a \\"container\\" for events. Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category. What type of measurements are used to quantify the number of events? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","response":"The question can be answered: To quantify the number of events, we typically use a counting system or numerical measurements.

His literary style was Atticistic imitating Classical Attic Greek in its prime. - Paolo Caliari, known as Paolo Veronese (15281588), was an Italian Renaissance painter, based in Venice, known for large-format history paintings of religion and mythology, such as \\"The Wedding at Cana\\"(1563) and \\"The Feast in the House of Levi\\" (1573). Included with Titian, a generation older, and Tintoretto, a decade senior, Veronese is one of the great trio that dominated Venetian painting of the \\"cinquecento\\" and the Late Renaissance in the 16th century. Known as a supreme colorist, and after an early period with Mannerism, Paolo Veronese developed a naturalist style of painting, influenced by Titian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Lucretia is a painting by Paolo Veronese from c. 1585 . - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth. - Tintoretto (born Jacopo Comin, late September or early October, 1518 May 31, 1594) was an Italian painter and a notable exponent of the Renaissance school. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso. His work is characterized by its muscular figures, dramatic gestures, and bold use of perspective in the Mannerist style, while maintaining color and light typical of the Venetian School. - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The work is a large-format (6.77 m × 9.94 m) oil painting executed in the Mannerist style of the High Renaissance (14901527); as such, \\"The Wedding Feast at Cana\\" is the most expansive canvas (67.29 m) in the paintings collection of the Musée du Louvre. - Mannerism is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, lasting until about 1580 in Italy, when the Baroque style began to replace it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century. - Titus Livius (64 or 59 BCAD 17)known as Livy in Englishwas a Roman historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people \\"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\\" (\\"Books from the Foundation of the City\\") covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own time. He was on familiar terms with the Julio-Claudian dynasty, advising Augustus's grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, as a young man not long before 14 AD in a letter to take up the writing of history. Livy and Augustus's wife, Livia, were from the same clan in different locations, although not related by blood. - The Feast in the House of Levi or Christ in the House of Levi is a 1573 painting by Italian painter Paolo Veronese and one of the largest canvases of the 16th century, measuring . It is now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. It was painted by Veronese for the rear wall of the refectory of the Basilica di Santi Giovanni e Paolo, a Dominican friary, as a \\"Last Supper\\", to replace an earlier work by Titian destroyed in the fire of 1571. - Cinquecento ('five hundred'; short for \\"millecinquecento\\" '1500') was the Italian Renaissance of the 16th century, including the current styles of art, music, literature, and architecture. - History painting is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than artistic style. History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word \\"historia\\" in Latin and Italian, meaning \\"story\\" or \\"narrative\\", and essentially means \\"story painting\\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850. In modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings. - Lucretia or Lucrece (died ) was an ancient Roman woman whose fate played a vital role in the transition of Roman government from the Roman Kingdom to the Roman Republic. While there were no contemporary sources, accounts from Roman historian Livy (Livius) and Greek-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus from the time of Emperor Caesar Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) agreed that there was such a woman and that her suicide after being raped by an Etruscan king's son was the immediate cause of the anti-monarchist rebellion that overthrew the monarchy.

The seventh and eighth major Nine Inch Nails studio-releases, Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, were released in March and May 2008 respectively. Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini. Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities. Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band. The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails. The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival. In May 2008, Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre-sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website. In an effort to combat ticket scalpers, each concert ticket will list the purchaser's legal name. The ticketing process was previously used for smaller pre-sales and was available exclusively to fan club members. On July 26, Reznor introduced an \\"unplugged\\" portion into the live show in which the band steps to the front of the stage about an hour into the show, with Reznor on vibraphone and bassist Meldal-Johnsen playing an upright bass. The 20-minute jazzy, acoustic set is taken mostly from Ghosts I - IV. The stage show also featured mesh LED curtains that projected various visuals, ranging from falling rain to static to a ruined city, and made the band appear to be playing on...

Nevertheless that an Australopithecus may have recognized a face would reveal that the early hominid had some sort of capacity for symbolic thinking, necessary for the development of art and language. If the early hominid has seen this object really as a face, or had magical speculations towards this object or just enjoyed the pebble remains unclear.

Available options: 1). no 2). yes","response":"The best answer would be 1). No. Justification: As per the context given, the Makapansgat pebble isn't considered art under the normal definition, as it was simply found and not deliberately crafted. Additionally, even though the Australopithecus possibly recognizing a face in the pebble suggests some capacity for symbolic thinking, it does not directly tie to the creation or recognition of art. The text does not provide concrete proof that the pebble was acknowledged as artwork or had specific symbolic importance.

Given these facts, what happens to chemical messengers for them to cause depression among the following options: - faulty - infected - Pesticides - cigarettes - spent - imbalanced - interact - sweating The answer to this question is:","response":"Imbalanced. Hormones play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and functioning of the body. These chemical messengers are responsible for regulating various aspects, such as growth, metabolism, mood, and immune function. Hormonal imbalance occurs when there is either too much or too little of a hormone in the bloodstream, which can have a considerable impact on a person's overall well-being. Among the given options, it is the state of being \\"imbalanced\\" that is most likely to cause depression. This is because an imbalance in the production or functioning of specific hormones can lead to physiological and psychological changes that contribute to the development of mental health issues like depression. For example, the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine play significant roles in mood regulation. Imbalance in these neurotransmitters can lead to mood disorders, including depression. Similarly, an imbalance in hormones such as cortisol (the stress hormone) can lead to chronic stress, which has been linked to the development of depression. The other options provided have less direct connections with hormonal imbalance and depression: - Faulty and infected: These terms could refer to a malfunction or infection within the body, which may indirectly contribute to hormonal imbalances. However, they don't specifically describe the causal relationship between the imbalance and depression. - Pesticides and cigarettes: These are environmental factors that may affect hormonal balance by disrupting endocrine function, but their direct connection with depression is not as clear. - Spent: This term implies that the hormone levels have been depleted, which could lead to an imbalance. Nevertheless, it does not directly connect the imbalance with depression. - Interact: Hormones do interact with target cells and various processes in the body. However, this term does not explain how hormonal imbalance can cause depression. - Sweating: Although sweating may be related to hormone production and regulation, it is not a direct cause of hormonal imbalance nor is it specifically related to depression. In conclusion, hormonal imbalances play a significant role in the development of depression. It is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage stress, and seek professional help if needed to address and treat any hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to depression."},{"question":"Tweet: @peg1039 hmm - did they happen to be his size of clubs? *thinking ulterior motive* thx, but i'll pass on ur lessons &amp; stick w/ a pro Predict the sentiment of this tweet.

Answer: Some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the Alpine orogeny. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","response":"Answer: Dinosaur tracks in Emosson, Switzerland, were first discovered in the early 1970s, but the site gained significant attention in 2000 when the reservoir lake was completely drained for maintenance work. The Emosson site features a unique collection of dinosaur footprints from the Triassic-Jurassic period, around 240 to 250 million years ago. The discoveries at the Emosson site provide valuable information about dinosaur behavior, migration, and the paleoenvironment during that time. The tracks found at the site predominantly belong to three different dinosaur species: Euparkeria, Eubrontes, and Grallator. The large number of tracks discovered reveal that this area may have been a popular migration route or habitat for these ancient creatures. Over the years, researchers and paleontologists have continued to study the tracks to reveal more about the dinosaurs and their interactions with their environment. The Emosson reservoir area is now a popular tourist site, featuring a dinosaur museum and trail, where visitors can go and see the ancient footprints along guided tours and learn more about these fascinating creatures and the prehistoric world they once inhabited. As a result of the presence of dinosaur tracks in Emosson, our understanding of the paleoenvironment, behavior and spatial distribution of these ancient creatures has increased. This knowledge allows scientists and researchers to better understand the history of the planet, ecosystem changes, and primeval biodiversity. It is essential to study these tracks continually and persist in excavating new sites to provide further insights into the past to help us appreciate the evolution of life on Earth."},{"question":"I was lost.

I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me.

If you think you have a worm virus, download a dedicated virus removal tool to scan for and remove viruses. Do this even if you already have antivirus software, as the software on your computer may be infected. Once you’ve chosen a virus removal tool, download it to your desktop. Most companies that sell antivirus software also offer free virus removal tools. Some options besides Microsoft’s own are Kaspersky Free Virus Scan and Sophos Virus Removal Tool. If you can’t use a web browser on the infected computer, use a different computer to download a virus removal tool, then burn it to a CD or DVD. Insert the burned disc into the infected machine, press ⊞ Win+E to launch File Explorer, then double-click your DVD-ROM drive to find the tool. Worms and other malware can hide in the System Restore files, which may hide them from virus removal tools. You should turn off System Restore before running the removal tool to prevent this from happening. Windows 7 and Vista users should type “protection” into the search box instead, then click “System protection.” ” This works on any Windows version. If you have a separate antivirus program like McAfee or Kaspersky, open it and find the “settings” or “options” area, then find an option for “disable” or “turn off.” Once the program is disabled, you’ll probably see a message that says your computer is at risk. You can ignore it for now as you’ll be restoring it soon. The computer will then reboot into the Chose an Option screen. This begins the process of booting into Safe Mode on a Windows 8 or 10 computer. To access Safe Mode on Windows 7 or Vista: Reboot the computer and tap the F8 key repeatedly as it restarts until you arrive at the Boot Options screen. ” In Windows 7, use the arrow keys to select “Safe Mode with Networking,” then press ↵ Enter to boot into that mode. You are now in safe mode and can skip the next few steps intended for Windows 10/8 users. ” The computer will reboot a second time. Or, if you inserted a CD/DVD that contains the tool, double-click the tool to open it. The scan will take at least several minutes to complete. Depending on the computer, software, and infection level, this may take over an hour. Once the virus scan is complete, the antivirus tool will report its results. If you see prompts to “quarantine” (another term for safely removing the malware from your PC), follow them so that the files are properly destroyed. Some programs, such as Microsoft’s Malicious Software Removal Tool, will remove the malware/worms without your intervention. If nothing is found, it’s very likely that you don't have a worm virus. If you still think you may be infected, try one of the other virus-removal tools. ” The computer will reboot normally, without a worm infection. Don't skip this step! To allow Windows to create automatic restore points for emergency use, return to the System Restore (called \\"System Protection\\" in Windows Vista and 7) dialog and check “Turn on system protection”. If you previously disabled your antivirus software, turn it back on now. Windows Defender is an antivirus/anti-malware suite built into Windows. Most PC manufacturers install free trial versions of antivirus software suites, which disable Defender by default. Enabling Defender is a great (and free!) way to keep your computer safe from worms. Press S to launch search, then type “defender”. Click “Windows Defender” in the search results, then (in Windows 8, 10) click “Settings,” and flip the following switches to the “On” position: Real-time protection, Cloud-based protection, and Automatic sample submission. In Windows Vista and 7, click “Tools,” then “Options,” and then “Administrator.” Select “Use this program,” then click “Save”.","response":"To remove a worm virus, download a dedicated virus removal tool like Kaspersky Free Virus Scan or Sophos Virus Removal Tool, disable System Restore, run the tool in Safe Mode, quarantine or remove detected malware, turn System Restore back on, and enable antivirus software like Windows Defender."},{"question":"(1) The track remains one of two tracks that Brant ever co-wrote , the other track also comes from the same album , entitled \`\` This Time Around '' .

The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to Coober Pedy, known as the \\"opal capital of Australia\\", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining opal. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them. Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's claim. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was \\"ratting\\" on his territory - that is, looking for opals on his turf. Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim.

Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied. If the next player has a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card, it can be stacked and possibly bring the \`\`out'' player back into play. Is this statement correct \\"can you end an uno game with a wild card\\"?","response":"Yes, the statement is correct -\\"You can end an Uno game with a Wild card\\". According to the official Uno rules, a game ends when one player runs out of cards, and a Wild card can certainly be the last card you dispose of. The only exception to this rule is the \\"Wild Draw Four\\" card. In many versions of Uno, you cannot finish the game with a Wild Draw Four card unless you have no other cards of the color that is currently in play. To give some more clarification, let's break down all the types of Uno cards: 1. Number Cards: These are the most common cards in the deck. Each color - red, blue, yellow, and green - has one 0 card and two of each number from 1 to 9. You can play these cards based on matching either the color or the number of the previously played card. 2. Action Cards: Each color in Uno has action cards: \\"Draw Two,\\" \\"Reverse,\\" and \\"Skip\\". You can play these cards on a corresponding color or on another card with the same action. 3. Wild Cards: There are two types of wild cards in Uno. - Basic Wild card: This card is black and lets you decide what color the next player has to play. There is no color or number requirement to play this card, and yes, you can end the game with a basic wild card. - Wild Draw Four card: This card lets you choose the color that continues play, plus the next player must draw four cards from the pile. According to many Uno rules, you may only play this card when you do not have another card that matches the current color. In summary, you absolutely can end an Uno game with a Wild card. However, it's important to remember that, depending on how you're playing, you might not be able to end the game with a Wild Draw Four card, unless that's your only option. These distinctions between cards and when they can be played add strategic elements to Uno, making it a fun and engaging game for many. Always make sure to clarify the rules with your fellow players before you start the game!"},{"question":"If \\"A black lady in traditional dress with a basket balanced on her head walking down a beach crowded with sunbathers.\\", does this mean that \\"woman takes sunbath along the beach\\"?

Q: 21847 A:","response":"To determine if the given number, 21847, is a prime number, we need to follow these steps: 1. Check if the number is greater than 1, since prime numbers are whole numbers above 1. In this case, 21847 is greater than 1. 2. Check if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. To do this, we will iterate through the numbers 2 to the square root of 21847 (approximately 147.8) and check if any of them is a divisor. If we find a divisor, then the number is not prime. Otherwise, it's prime. Step-by-step iteration: Starting from 2, we check each number as a potential divisor until we reach the square root of 21847. 2 is not a divisor of 21847, because 21847 / 2 = 10923 with a remainder. 3 is not a divisor of 21847, because 21847 / 3 = 7282 with a remainder. ...

He held the world heavyweight title from 1959 to 1960, and was the fifth heavyweight champion born outside the United States. Johansson won the title by defeating Floyd Patterson via third-round stoppage, after flooring him seven times in that round. For this achievement, Johansson was awarded the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year--the only non-American to do so in the belt's entire 27-year existence--and was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. Johansson's introduction to the top rank of the sport was inauspicious. At age nineteen he was disqualified for passivity at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympics in the heavyweight competition in a fight against eventual Olympic gold medalist Ed Sanders. Johansson maintained he was not evading Sanders (who also got a warning for passivity), but rather was trying to tire his opponent. Johansson said he had been limited to a 10-day training camp, had only trained with newcomers, and had been told by his coach to let Sanders be the aggressor. Nevertheless, his silver medal was withheld for poor performance and only presented to him in 1982. Johansson had earned his spot in the Olympics by winning the Swedish National Championship earlier the same year, 1952, after he knocked out his opponent in the first round of the final. After the Olympics Johansson went into seclusion for six months and considered quitting boxing. However, he returned to the ring and turned professional under the guidance of the Swedish publisher and boxing promoter Edwin Ahlquist, subsequently winning his first 21 professional fights. He won the Scandinavian pro title by knocking down and outscoring the Dane Erik Jensen (breaking his right hand in the process). A broken hand and a one-year military service kept him out of the ring until late 1954. In August 1955, in his twelfth professional fight, Johansson knocked out former European Heavyweight Champion Hein ten Hoff in the first round. He took the Scandinavian heavyweight title in 1953 and, on 30 September 1956, he won the European Heavyweight Championship by scoring a 13th-round KO over Italy's Franco Cavicchi in Milan for the European title. Johansson successfully defended his European Crown against ranked heavyweights Henry Cooper (fifth-round KO on 19 May 1957) and Joe Erskine, with a TKO in 13 on 21 February 1958.

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own?, what is it ?

The local government has allocated a budget to implement a flood prevention system to mitigate future flooding disasters. Part of the flood prevention system includes the construction of a pumping station and a series of retention basins around the town. Hypothesis: The implementation of a well-designed flood prevention system consisting of a pumping station and retention basins will significantly reduce the frequency and severity of flood-related disasters in the small rural town. Step-by-step justification: 1. Identify the problem: The small rural town has faced repeated flooding disasters in the past, which has caused property damage and negatively impacted the lives of residents. 2. Propose a solution: A flood prevention system, including a pumping station and retention basins, could help alleviate the problem by managing and controlling water flow during heavy rainfall events. 3. Justify the solution: The pumping station would help remove excess water more quickly during periods of heavy rainfall, reducing the risk of flooding. Retention basins would help create temporary storage areas for stormwater runoff, allowing for a more controlled release of water during and after a storm. 4. Set a hypothesis: The hypothesis states that if the flood prevention system is well-designed and effectively implemented, it will significantly reduce the frequency and severity of flood-related disasters in the town. 5. Test the hypothesis: The hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rate of flood-related disasters before and after implementing the flood prevention system. Decreases in the frequency and severity of floods would support the hypothesis. 6.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","response":"A modern central processing unit (CPU) chip, also known as a microprocessor, is significantly larger than a house key. Although technology has advanced considerably, allowing for the miniaturization of many electronic devices and components, a CPU is still larger and has a different form factor than a typical house key. A modern CPU chip size varies depending on the specific model and its intended use. For example, most consumer-grade desktop processors have a size ranging from 3.37 cm x 3.37 cm (37.5mm x 37.5mm) for Intel CPUs to 4.06 cm x 4.06 cm (40.64mm x 40.64mm) for AMD CPUs. These are the dimensions of the integrated heat spreader (IHS) on top of the CPU, which is the part that you see and touch when you hold a processor. A typical house key is much smaller, with a length that usually ranges from approximately 4 cm to 9 cm, and a width of about 2 cm to 2.5 cm at its widest part. The main body of the key is even narrower, generally about 0.8 cm to 1 cm wide. Given these dimensions, a modern CPU chip would not fit on a house key. The CPU chip is not only larger in size, but it also has a completely different shape and structure, with many exposed pins or contact pads on the bottom. Furthermore, a traditional metal house key is not an appropriate material or substrate for a semiconductor device like a CPU. In conclusion, a modern central processing unit circuit chip would not fit on a house key due to the significant size and shape differences, as well as the incompatibility of materials."},{"question":"Given the question: Question: \\"Which of the following is not a body of water: India, the Bay of Bengal, or the Andaman Sea?\\" Context: \\"Myanmar (myan-MAR i/miɑːnˈmɑːr/ mee-ahn-MAR, /miˈɛnmɑːr/ mee-EN-mar or /maɪˈænmɑːr/ my-AN-mar (also with the stress on first syllable); Burmese pronunciation: [mjəmà]),[nb 1] officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma, is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women. - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\" - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death. - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\" - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream . - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.

Fact 2: Exercise is fun if it is also play. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can teach animals how to behave?\\" with the following options: - adding heat - humans - fossil fuels - A computer - nerves - people - irradiation - exercise","response":"Given the two facts that you've provided, it can be concluded that exercise is the most suitable option for teaching animals how to behave. Let's explore the connection between the two facts and the reasoning behind this conclusion. Fact 1: Playing is one way mammals and other animals learn how to behave. When animals play, they aren't just indulging themselves in mindless enjoyment. Play serves an essential role in refining their social, motor, and cognitive skills. Through play, animals are exposed to various scenarios that enable them to experiment, learn, and adapt to their surroundings. They practice taking risks and develop appropriate responses to different situations, which ultimately shape their behavior. For instance, young predator animals learn essential hunting strategies, whereas prey animals get accustomed to escaping and hiding through engaging in play. Fact 2: Exercise is fun if it is also play. Apart from the health benefits, exercise in the form of play brings a lot of enjoyment to both animals and humans. When the exercise resembles play, it triggers positive emotions and rewards, making the learning process easier and more fun. Suppose an animal is introduced to a new environment or situation through a playful and engaging exercise. In that case, it will likely be more open to learning new behaviors and adapting naturally since the process is perceived as entertaining rather than stressful or threatening. Given these two facts, we can now connect the dots and come to the conclusion that exercise can indeed teach animals how to behave. Implementing exercise as a form of play provides animals with a fun, engaging, and stimulating way to develop their skills and behaviors, affecting the way they interact and respond to various situations, other animals, and their environment. Other options like adding heat, humans, fossil fuels, a computer, nerves, people, and irradiation do not directly align with the two facts stated above. Indeed, some of these options might play a role in shaping an animal's behavior or environment, but they wouldn't typically or directly teach animals how to behave through play or exercise."},{"question":"Article: We all want to live comfortably and safely here, so here are some rules. we hope that all residents can follow.

What if it was even more fun to drive? BMW has bet considerable resources that the cost advantages of operating an electric car will outweigh the one big disadvantage â range. BMW says the i3, which will come to market in Europe in November and the United States next year, can travel 186 miles when equipped with an optional range extender, a motorcyclelike gasoline engine that helps maintain the charge when the car runs low. Otherwise, the car will be able to travel about half that distance, or about 93 miles, on a single charge. The new car the company showed automobile writers on Monday at a former military airfield outside Munich had the pep and agility drivers have come to expect from BMW sedans â though not necessarily that of the Z sports cars or M series muscle cars. The i3 has some bonus features, like a quiet ride and a power recovery system that reduces the need to use the brakes since letting up on the accelerator quickly slows the car. Executives hope the i3 will decisively persuade consumers to accept electric cars. âWe are at the dawn of a new era,â Ian Robertson, BMWâs head of sales, told reporters on Monday. BMW executives insist that going 186 miles between plug-in charges â they take less than an hour at special stations and six to eight hours from a wall socket at home â is enough range for people living in urban or suburban areas. Extensive trial projects with electrified Minis and 1 Series cars showed that Americans typically drove less than 40 miles a day. In power-saving mode, which turns down the air-conditioning and other power-hungry functions, the i3âs range is about 120 miles. Perhaps mindful of forecasts by rival electric carmakers that proved overly optimistic, Mr. Robertson declined to name sales targets for the i3. BMW plans simultaneous public introductions of the i3, which has begun production at BMWâs factory in Leipzig, Germany, at the end of July in New York, London and Beijing. The company has not yet revealed the price for the i3 or any of its options, but it is likely to be well under 40,000. Despite a price that will probably be somewhat higher than a conventional 3 Series sedan, the i3 brings some cost advantages. The i3 never needs an oil change and a power recovery system, which slows the car automatically, means the brakes should last much longer than in a conventional car. There are far fewer moving parts to wear out. A full charge should cost well under 10 depending on local power costs, a particularly large advantage in Europe. One reason that electric cars have not been a hit with buyers is that people perceive them as being much more expensive, with more limited range, and no obvious advantages over cars that rely on gasoline or diesel fuel. So far, not many buyers have been willing to pay much extra for the right to feel good about driving a car that is free of emissions from a gasoline engine. An electric car gives more options to engineers in placing components that drive the car and optimizing weight distribution. In the i3, BMW engineers put the batteries under the passenger compartment in a rectangular aluminum box roughly the size of a double bed. The electric motor is mounted above the rear wheels. The passenger compartment is made largely of lightweight carbon fiber. The effect is a low center of gravity and even distribution of weight between the front and rear axles. So even though the i3 has the upright profile of a hatchback and stands notably taller than a BMW Mini or 3 Series sedan, it feels remarkably stable slaloming around pylons or negotiating a tight curve at high speed. At the same time, the i3 has a smaller turning radius than a Mini, giving it greater maneuverability in the urban environments for which it is intended. BMW is going to great lengths to alleviate range anxiety. A display in the car will show the location of nearby recharging stations. BMW will also offer a roadside assistance program in areas where sales justify it. Instead of a tow, the assistance vehicle will provide a charge so the i3 can travel to the next charging station. Mr. Robertson said he expected the i3 to be a second car for most buyers. But for customers who might occasionally want to drive long distances, BMW will offer packages allowing them occasional loans of gasoline or diesel-powered BMW models. Even if the i3 is a flop, BMW expects to earn a return on its investment. It is already working on hybrid cars that will use the same aluminum and carbon body architecture. For the time being, Mr. Robertson said, BMW plans to be âa significant playerâ in the market for electric cars, which he put at 150,000 vehicles a year. True mass acceptance, he said, will come when electric cars cost less than 10 percent more than a conventional vehicle and can travel at least 186 miles on a battery charge. âBattery technology will develop more in the next five years than in the last 100 years,â he said. Summary:","response":"BMW is attempting to ease range anxiety with its i3 electric car, set to launch in Europe in November and the US next year. With an optional range extender equipped, the i3 can travel 186 miles, which BMW says is sufficient for urban and suburban living. The vehicle also includes convenient features such as a quiet ride and a power recovery system that reduces the need for brakes. With the i3, BMW hopes to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and become a significant player in the emerging market."},{"question":"Instructions: In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ).

You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago. Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life. More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born.

Step 3: Analyze each object for metal content - Curtain: It is primarily made of fabric or textile materials, which are not metals. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a thermal conductor. - Wall: It is typically made of concrete, brick, or wood materials. All these materials do not necessarily contain metals and are considered thermal insulators. So, a wall is unlikely to be a thermal conductor. - Table: A table could be made from various materials like wood, glass, or metal. If there is a metal table in the list of options, it has metallic content and can be a thermal conductor. - Mirror: Mirrors have a glass surface with a reflective metal coating on one side (such as aluminum or silver). The metallic coating makes it possible for a mirror to be a thermal conductor. Step 4: Choose the best answer Based on the analysis, the table is the only object that could be made entirely out of metal. A metal table would be a thermal conductor because metal is a thermal conductor. The mirror might have some metal content, but it does not have as strong of a case as the table. Final answer: table"},{"question":"Summarize this article: The Scottish government is facing demands from environmental campaigners for a permanent ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction. It follows Mr Ewing's announcement in January of a \\"moratorium\\" on fracking. Mr Ewing told MSPs the temporary ban would remain in place until the Scottish government had carried out a full public consultation. There will also be a public health assessment, planning guidance is to be strengthened and environmental regulations are to be reviewed. In BBC Scotland Investigates: The War Over Fracking, to be broadcast on Wednesday night, Mr Ewing was asked about the likelihood of a permanent ban. He said: \\"We should have a national debate about the topic, especially since we are to acquire, we hope, powers in respect of the unconventional oil and gas issue before very long. \\"So this is the right time to have a national debate informed by evidence.\\" The minister is then asked: \\"If the Scottish public clearly says it doesn't want this, will that be enough for you to introduce a permanent ban?\\" Mr Ewing replies: \\"Well, let's see what the debate comprises. I don't want to prejudge that debate.\\" The energy minister tells the programme: \\"Hydraulic fracturing has been carried out in the USA on a very large scale. But the central belt of Scotland is not North Dakota. \\"It is different and we need to think how it will be, how it may be, applied to Scotland.\\" The programme also heard from Ineos director, Tom Crotty, who said shale gas would have a crucial role to play in the future of the company's huge petrochemicals plant at Grangemouth. Mr Crotty said: \\"We need to address a lot of misconceptions that have grown up over the last couple of years about this industry. \\"We believe it is extremely safe and we have to persuade people of that.\\" One of Scotland's leading experts on fracking told the programme public confidence in the ability of the authorities to regulate the industry would be key. Zoe Shipton, professor of geological engineering at the University of Strathclyde and a member of the Scottish government's Independent Expert Panel on Unconventional Oil and Gas, said: \\"We know how to engineer the process so that it will minimise the risk of ground water, surface water contamination, unintended releases of methane and so on. \\"But clearly, when you think about local communities there are real issues of trust.\\" The documentary also examines the impact fracking could have on the Scottish environment and on carbon emissions. Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \\"In Scotland, we already produce seven times more fossil fuels than we use. \\"Around the world we produce about five times more fossil fuels than we can possibly afford to burn if we're to avoid disastrous climate change. \\"So the last thing we need anywhere, but particularly in Scotland, is new fossil fuels.\\" Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said he believed many communities in Scotland would be \\"alarmed\\" at Mr Ewing's comments. He added: \\"Not only is the SNP's energy minister still talking about this dangerous industry as an opportunity, but he appears to be suggesting it will eventually take place.\\" Supporters of the unconventional oil and gas industry say burning shale gas, rather than coal, to produce electricity, could help reduce global carbon emissions. Fergus Ewing believes the Scottish government's policy on fracking should be based on a \\"rational analysis\\" of the facts. He's found himself at the heart of an increasingly heated and divisive debate. And he knows it is an issue fraught with political dangers. Industrial giants like Ineos believe any genuinely \\"rational analysis\\" will result in approval for unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland. They say it could transform the prospects for Scottish manufacturing and argue the potential environmental impact has been exaggerated. But Mr Ewing has a problem. That's because environmental campaigners and the growing number of community-based anti-fracking groups believe his \\"rational analysis\\" of the facts will win the day for them. They point to local environmental impacts and the over-arching issue of climate change. The Scottish government's moratorium, announced in January, has given Mr Ewing much-needed breathing space. It means the issue won't have to be settled until after next year's Scottish parliamentary elections. But difficult decisions lie ahead for the minister. Both sides in the war over fracking welcomed his announcement of the moratorium as an opportunity for them to make their case, and ultimately win the day. The clock is ticking. More than a century ago, the shale oil industry transformed the landscape of central Scotland. Today, the shale bings of West Lothian still stand testament to that. Sooner or later, we will have to decide if it is time to go frack to the future. BBC Scotland Investigates: The War Over Fracking will be broadcast on BBC1 Scotland at 1930 on Wednesday 29 April. It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.","response":"Environmental campaigners are demanding a permanent ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction from the Scottish government, after the government's announcement of a moratorium on fracking in January.

Options: - stagnation - tradition - paper money - wife - unpleasant Let's think step by step:","response":"When examining the options provided as reasons for a person to change, we can analyze each one to determine which might be the most likely cause: 1. Stagnation: If a person experiences stagnation in their personal or professional life, they might be compelled to change in order to seek new experiences, growth, or improvement. This reason could demand change. 2. Tradition: Traditions can sometimes be restrictive or limiting, so if a person wants to break free from the confines of tradition, they may feel the need to change. However, tradition could also inspire a person to change in order to maintain or follow established customs. 3. Paper money: It is unlikely that paper money on its own would demand a person to change. However, financial issues or changes in one's monetary circumstances might prompt them to adjust their behavior, mindset, or priorities. 4. Wife: If a person's spouse (in this case, a wife) has certain expectations, desires or needs that are not being met, they may request or demand changes in their partner. In this context, it's possible that a wife could demand change in a person. 5. Unpleasant: If a person finds their current situation or environment unpleasant, they may be motivated to change in order to escape or improve that unpleasantness. Taking each option into consideration, it can be concluded that stagnation, tradition, wife, and unpleasant circumstances could potentially demand a person to change. The paper money, in isolation, is an unlikely cause for change."},{"question":"Q:Modern Chinese use the solar calendar as English people do . But at the same time, they use their own lunar calendar.

This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine) about her experience with a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in, she decides to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, a student named Lisa (Jacinda Barrett) feels dazed and prepares to leave the bar, when someone abducts her. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney was removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window and is decapitated in the process. Lisa is not missed as she was about to go on a trip. The next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby Belcher (Anson Mount), who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor by the same killer who killed Lisa. Her friends witness her death when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene, but discount it as another piece of acting, wondering who shot it. As there is no body and Sandra was about to go on a trip, her disappearance goes unnoticed. Travis (Matthew Davis) is found to have committed suicide at the campus tower. At the funeral, Amy is offered help by Graham (Joey Lawrence), a student from a prosperous Hollywood background. She refuses, wishing to make it on her own.

The Gaffer plays a key role in the production process of films, television shows, and commercials, ensuring that the visual elements are effectively lit to create the desired mood, atmosphere, and overall aesthetic. In collaboration with the Director of Photography (DoP) or the Cinematographer, the Gaffer ensures that the lighting design aligns with the creative vision of the director and enhances the storytelling aspects of the production. One of the Gaffer's main responsibilities is planning, setting up, and maintaining various lighting systems and equipment throughout the production process. This may include working with tungsten lights, LED lights, HMI lights, or other types of specialized light fixtures. They also manage the distribution of power to these lights, ensuring proper usage of electrical resources. Additionally, the Gaffer leads a team of lighting technicians called the electrical department or \\"electrics\\", which can include Best Boys (the Gaffer's assistant), Generator Operators, and additional Lighting Technicians. This team works together to execute the lighting plan and make adjustments as needed during production. Another critical aspect of a Gaffer's job is to ensure safety standards are met in relation to electrical work and lighting installations. This includes selecting appropriate cables, connectors, and fuses, as well as following necessary protocols to avoid electrical hazards. They are also responsible for adhering to regulations and guidelines laid out by electrical authorities, unions, and filmmaking safety commissions. Furthermore, the Gaffer is responsible for managing the budget of the lighting department. They provide input on the necessary lighting and electrical equipment for the production, anticipating equipment rental costs and suggesting cost-effective lighting solutions when possible. This requires the Gaffer to have extensive knowledge of available lighting technology and be up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Overall, the role of the Gaffer on a film or TV set is essential to the visual success of a production. As the Chief Electrician in charge of lighting, they combine their creativity, technical knowledge, and leadership skills to create a well-lit environment that facilitates effective storytelling, provides aesthetic appeal, and ensures the safety of cast and crew alike."},{"question":"The initial incarnation of Fleetwood Mac performed its first gig in August 1967 at the seventh annual Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival, playing a Chicago-style blues. McVie, initially hesitant to commit, was later prompted to leave the Bluesbreakers and join Fleetwood Mac full-time when the former adopted a horns section with which he disagreed. He replaced the initial bassist, Bob Brunning. McVie, Fleetwood, Green and guitarist Jeremy Spencer thus formed the first fixed line-up of Fleetwood Mac. The band's first album, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, was released in 1968, and the band toured the United States for the first time, though Green was reluctant to do so for fear of gun crime. Upon their return, they recorded a second album, Mr. Wonderful under simply \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" with Green's name dropped. A guest musician on the album, Christine Perfect, became close with the group and she and McVie were married in 1968. A third guitarist, Danny Kirwan, was also added to the line-up. Despite the success of their third album, Then Play On, and a string of hit singles including \\"Albatross\\" and \\"Man of the World\\", Green himself drifted away from the band, struggling both creatively and with increasing use of LSD. He later joined a Christian religious group. Fleetwood himself later remarked on the growing stature of Green's difficulties: \\"I think there is certainly some credence given to the idea that Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany ... I don't think it did him much good.\\" He also recalled in 1995 that \\"Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places--none of which really happened.

Five homes in Rice, Texas, were destroyed as 125 mph winds whipped through a seven-mile swath of Navarro County Sunday evening, said Eric Meyers, the county's emergency management coordinator. Meyers rode out the tornado inside a vehicle and videotaped the twister as it tore the roof off a school about a block away. \\"We are in the tornado! We are in the tornado!\\" Meyers yells several times in the video. \\"The sheer power was just amazing,\\" Meyers said in an interview Monday on CNN's \\"American Morning\\" program. The storm, which struck around 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), also turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car, knocked 11 cars from a freight train off their tracks and caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School, Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. Video: 'People screamed, cried, and prayed' as tornado passed. Four people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, he said. In addition to \\"significant damage\\" from the storm moving through Navarro County, witnesses also reported possible tornadoes in other parts of northeast Texas Sunday evening, the National Weather Service said. Callers reported four tornadoes in Lone Oak, Texas, Fire Chief Chris Moore said, but authorities had not yet confirmed whether a twister had touched down there. The storm destroyed one home, damaged three others and knocked down power lines there, Moore said. Authorities called off a youth football game as winds picked up speed and hail pelted the county, he said. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos. Sonia Butler hunkered down in the bathroom of her Rice home with her brother as the storm hit. \\"You could just hear the wind coming through the house and it felt like a big suction,\\" she told CNN affiliate WFAA. \\"And then it sounded like a loud train, and it only lasted -- not very long, but after that, after we came out of the restroom, our house was just gone.\\" Her husband, Raymond Butler, sought shelter in another part of the home as the storm hit. The room he stayed in remained untouched, but the storm demolished most of their home, ripping off the roof, shattering light bulbs and breaking their deceased daughter's track trophies. The storm also destroyed two trucks, a trailer, and a giant pecan tree on the property -- but it spared the grave of their daughter, who died last year. \\"I just got down on my knees and said, 'Lord be with us,' \\" Raymond Butler told WFAA. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. \\"We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,\\" he said. Someone screamed when they saw a funnel forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. \\"The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening. ... We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,\\" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. \\"Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,\\" he said. Later Sunday, a possible tornado swept through Baldwin County, Alabama, knocking down power lines and tree branches, destroying a mobile home and shifting another mobile home off its foundation, said Leigh Ann Ryals with the county's Emergency Operations Center. One person was injured, Ryals said, and crews planned to continue surveying damage Monday. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jessica Jordan, Rick Martin and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.

Its name was a misnomer, as France already had colonies overseas and was short lived compared to the Colonial Empire. - Charles Percier ( ( al psje ) ; 22 August 1764 -- 5 September 1838 ) was a neoclassical French architect , interior decorator and designer , who worked in a close partnership with Pierre François Léonard Fontaine , originally his friend from student days . For work undertaken from 1794 onward , trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless ; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion . Together , Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich , grand , consciously - archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style . Following Charles Percier 's death in 1838 , Fontaine designed a tomb in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery . Percier and Fontaine had lived together as well as being colleagues . Fontaine married late in life and after his death in 1853 his body was placed in the same tomb according to his wishes . - The Empire style, , the second phase of Romanticism, is an early-nineteenth-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts that flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the Consulate and the First French Empire periods, although its life span lasted until the late 1820s (or more in some countries).

Question: Jim lives 20 miles from the Riot servers. Jeff lives 2000 miles from the Riot servers. Both have the same internet speed. Who's ping will be higher? (A) Jim (B) Jeff A:","response":"Step 1: Understanding the question. The question asks us to determine who will have a higher ping between Jim and Jeff, based on their distances from the Riot servers. Step 2: Define ping. Ping refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one device to another and back, usually measured in milliseconds (ms). Step 3: Assess the factors influencing ping. One of the primary factors that affects ping is distance. The greater the distance between the user and the server, the higher the ping tends to be, assuming all other factors such as internet speed are equal. Step 4: Consider the distance differences. Jim lives 20 miles from the Riot servers, whereas Jeff lives 2000 miles away. Step 5: Compare the distances to determine who is likely to have a higher ping. Since Jeff lives significantly farther away from the Riot servers compared to Jim (2000 miles versus 20 miles), his data packets would take longer to travel to the server and back. Answer: Therefore, the person with the higher ping will be (B) Jeff."},{"question":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Two students read about brains in the animal kingdom. Tom read more about the brains of mammals, while Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians. But I can use this background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal. What is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about the neocortex of rats? The answer is:","response":"Reed learned less about the neocortex of rats. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the scenario, which indicates that Tom focused on studying the brains of mammals, while Reed focused on the brains of amphibians. The neocortex, as described in the background information, is a unique layer of nerve cells found only in the cerebrum of mammals. Since rats are mammals, it is logical that Tom would have encountered more information about the neocortex of rats in his studies. In contrast, Reed's area of study was about amphibians, which do not possess a neocortex. Therefore, Reed would not have come across much, if any, information about the neocortex of rats, or any other mammals for that matter, since his focus was on a different group of animals altogether. As a result, Reed would have learned less about the neocortex of rats in comparison to Tom, who was specifically studying mammals and their brains."},{"question":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Bush won the Iowa straw poll. Sentence 2: George W. Bush never won a single straw poll. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To explain this, let's first understand what entailment is and analyze these two given sentences. Entailment in linguistic terms refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other sentence. In other words, if one sentence then the other sentence must also be true, and if any of the sentences is false, the other sentence must be false too. In this case, we are looking at two sentences: Sentence 1: George W. Bush won the Iowa straw poll. Sentence 2: George W. Bush never won a single straw poll. Sentence 1 indicates that George W. Bush has won at least one straw poll, specifically the Iowa straw poll. Straw polls are informal and non-binding votes typically used to gauge the popularity of political candidates or the public's opinion on policy issues. Sentence 2, on the other hand, claims that George W. Bush never won any straw poll. Since these two sentences convey conflicting information, they do not have an entailment relationship. Rather, they are contradictory to each other. If Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must be false, because it is claiming George W. Bush never won any straw poll, despite having won the Iowa straw poll according to Sentence 1. Conversely, if Sentence 2 is true, that would mean Sentence 1 is false, as George W. Bush would not have won the Iowa straw poll nor any other straw poll. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Rather, they are contradictory statements where the truth of one negates the truth of the other."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or \\"church order\\") and worship; often using a \\"Book of Order\\" to regulate common practice and order.

Finnish:","response":"Missä siis on ongelma?"},{"question":"Question: Given the below context: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation.

Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, disease of the liver or gall bladder, cystic fibrosis, and problems with your pancreas can affect your fat absorption. These will require treatment or additional vitamin A supplementation to get your RDA of vitamin A. How you absorb fat is also decreased if you have had part or all of your stomach removed, such as after certain kinds of weight-loss surgeries. Alcohol can interfere with your body’s ability to absorb vitamin A (and other needed nutrients).Stop drinking alcohol altogether, or limit your alcohol intake to, say, one glass daily to maintain good health and promote vitamin absorption. The prescription medication Orlistat is used to help people lose weight, but because of how it works it can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A. Olestra, a fat substitute sometimes added to food, can cause similar problems. Avoid these if you require a vitamin A supplement. If you are at risk for vitamin A deficiency, speak to your healthcare provider about any medications that you are taking. Some cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants, like cholestyramine and colestipol, can block vitamin A absorption; another kind of cholesterol medicine, called statins, can actually help vitamin A absorption. Omeprazole (Prilosec) is used for heartburn and reflux, and can cause absorption issues, as can the antibiotic Neomycin. Switching to different medicines with your doctor's advice can help.

Why did the US and USSR have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons when only a few hundred would've been enough to destroy the other country? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: + no. + yes.","response":"The two questions raised are not the same, but they share a common theme: the influence of political, social, and historical factors on the strategic decision-making of nations. To address each question in detail: 1. Why do some Americans wrongly think Russia would conquer Europe without the few thousand US soldiers stationed on the continent? This perception can be attributed to a number of factors, including historical events, the media, and a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities. Historically, Europe has been the battleground for major wars and conflicts, particularly during World War II, when the Soviet Union expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe. This created a sense of wariness among Western countries, leading to the establishment of NATO in 1949, with the objective of providing collective security against potential Soviet aggression. The United States has been a key player in NATO, and its military presence in Europe is seen as a deterrent to Russian ambitions. The media has also played a role in shaping this perception, with a tendency to focus on Russia's aggressive actions, such as its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. This reinforces the fear of a Russian invasion of Europe. Moreover, movies and books from popular culture have often depicted Russia as a nefarious adversary to the West, which can exacerbate anxiety about its intentions. Furthermore, there may be a general misunderstanding of contemporary military capabilities and strategies. Conventional warfare is no longer the only method for securing power and influence. Today, nations rely more on soft power and covert operations, economic leverage, and cyber-warfare to achieve their objectives. It is not necessary for Russia to physically conquer Europe, as they can wield influence through these other means. The presence of American troops in Europe, while a significant deterrent, does not solely determine Russia's ability to achieve its goals. 2. Why did the US and USSR have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons when only a few hundred would've been enough to destroy the other country? The reason for this lies in the principle of deterrence and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which were dominant during the Cold War era. Deterrence, in this context, means that by possessing a large number of nuclear weapons, each side could guarantee that it could retaliate and cause devastating consequences to the other side in the event of an attack. The potential devastation was intended to prevent either side from considering a preemptive nuclear strike, as it would essentially be suicidal. The balance of nuclear power acted as a stabilizing factor, despite the inherent risks involved. MAD's rationale is the idea that if both sides possess enough nuclear firepower to completely annihilate the other, regardless of who initiates the conflict, it would eliminate any incentive for either side to start a nuclear war. With this mindset, possessing significantly more nuclear weapons than necessary to destroy the other country may seem like an advantage, as it might convince the opponent that retaliation would be even more catastrophic. In summary, both questions raise distinct issues regarding strategic decisions made by the US and Russia (or the USSR), but they are not the same. One focuses on the perception of Russian aggression and the importance of US military presence in Europe, while the other delves into the rationale behind the possession of large nuclear arsenals during the Cold War. Yet, both questions highlight the significant impact of historical, social, and political factors on national security decision-making."},{"question":"i Cant smell the weekend yet....we work on saturdays too Select your answer from the options.

Options: (A) 22 (B) 02 (C) 78 (D) 50 (E) 18 Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","response":"To find the answer, we will first need to determine the sum of the first four results using the average of the first four results, which is 45. Step 1: Calculate the sum of first four results. Using the average formula: average = sum of numbers / number of values sum of first four results = average of first four results * number of values sum of first four results = 45 * 4 sum of first four results = 180 Next, we can calculate the sum of all five results using the given overall average, which is 46. Step 2: Calculate the sum of all five results. average = sum of numbers / number of values sum of five results = average of five results * number of values sum of five results = 46 * 5 sum of five results = 230 Now, we can find the fifth result by subtracting the sum of the first four results from the sum of all five results. Step 3: Find the fifth result. fifth result = sum of five results - sum of first four results fifth result = 230 - 180 fifth result = 50 Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 50."},{"question":"Write a sentence based on this summary: turkey puts ailing private hospitals for sale","response":"Turkey is selling some private hospitals that are not feeling very well."},{"question":"I heard that Addison finished her studies and decided to watch a movie.
