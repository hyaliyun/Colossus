One common component is the clause, which can be independent or dependent - that is, it can either stand alone as a complete idea or need to be attached to another clause to be fully understood. When we have just one independent clause that is capable of communicating a complete thought without needing additional context or support, we refer to that as being a unique grammatical unit. This often creates straightforward statements for easy comprehension, not needing any other clauses for the reader to grasp the main idea. What this all boils down to is the concept of a single, self-contained unit known as Sentence A."},{"question":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer.

A:","response":"\\"Outrageous Fortune\\" is a phrase that originates from William Shakespeare's famous play \\"Hamlet,\\" which is set in the country of Denmark. The full phrase \\"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\\" is found in Hamlet's well-known \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy in Act III, Scene 1 of the play. \\"Hamlet\\" is a tragedy that tells the story of Prince Hamlet, the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. The play revolves around the themes of revenge, betrayal, and moral dilemmas as Hamlet seeks justice for his father's murder in the Kingdom of Denmark. The phrase \\"outrageous fortune\\" refers to the misfortunes and cruel circumstances that befall people in their lives, and in the context of the play, it reflects the inner turmoil and existential crisis Prince Hamlet is going through. Set primarily in the castle of Elsinore, Denmark, \\"Hamlet\\" displays the political and social dynamics of the Danish royal court during the Middle Ages. Denmark's historical connections to Vikings, Norse mythology, and the Germanic tribes also create a background for Shakespeare's play. The events of the play delve into the complexities and intricacies of life in a royal court and explores how ambition, revenge, and political conspiracies shape the lives of individuals and nations. In conclusion, the name \\"Outrageous Fortune\\" is derived from Shakespeare's play \\"Hamlet,\\" which is set in the country of Denmark. The themes, motifs, and setting of the play reflect the intricacies of life at the Danish royal court during the Middle Ages and present timeless lessons that continue to resonate with audiences today."},{"question":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, area = riverside Sentence:","response":"Fitzbillies, a charming riverside coffee shop, specializes in serving delectable Italian cuisine in a picturesque setting along the riverfront."},{"question":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Therefore, it's unlikely that Sally, who is afraid of danger, would double-check this option. 2. Secure: This option is related to ensuring that something is protected or free from danger. Sally might double-check this to make sure she's avoiding risky situations. 3. Being safe: Similar to the previous option, this revolves around avoiding danger and staying safe. It would make sense for Sally to double-check this as well. 4. Safety: This option is directly related to the state of being safe from harm or danger.

The sentences referring to making travel plans with \\"Ariel Castro\\", \\"CNN\\", \\"Cleveland\\", and \\"Gregg\\" do not make sense in this context. The version involving Ariel Castro could be confusing, as it seems to refer to travel arrangements being made with him rather than arrangements that the family had to cancel due to his behavior.

Her father was Antony Kidman (1938-2014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75. Her mother, Janelle Ann (nee Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband's books and was a member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. Kidman's ancestry includes Irish, Scottish and English heritage. In 2002, Kidman first appeared on the Australian rich list published annually in the Business Review Weekly with an estimated net worth of A122 million. In the 2011 published list, Kidman's wealth was estimated at A304 million, down from A329 million in 2010. Kidman has raised money for, and drawn attention to, disadvantaged children around the world. In 1994, she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, and in 2004, she was honoured as a \\"Citizen of the World\\" by the United Nations. Kidman joined the Little Tee Campaign for breast cancer care to design T-shirts or vests to raise money to fight the disease; motivated by her mother's own battle with breast cancer in 1984. In the 2006 Australia Day Honours, Kidman was made a Companion of Order of Australia (AC) for \\"service to the performing arts as an acclaimed motion picture performer, to health care through contributions to improve medical treatment for women and children and advocacy for cancer research, to youth as a principal supporter of young performing artists, and to humanitarian causes in Australia and internationally.\\" However, due to film commitments and her wedding to Urban, it wasn't until 13 April 2007 that she was presented with the honour. It was presented by the Governor-General of Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery, in a ceremony at Government House, Canberra. Kidman was appointed goodwill ambassador of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in 2006. In this capacity, Kidman has addressed international audiences at UN events, raised awareness through the media and testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs to support the International Violence against Women Act. Kidman visited Kosovo in 2006 to learn about women's experiences of conflict and UNIFEM's support efforts. She is the international spokesperson for UNIFEM's Say NO - UNiTE to End Violence against Women initiative. Kidman and the UNIFEM executive director presented over five million signatures collected during the first phase of this to the UN Secretary-General on 25 November 2008. In the beginning of 2009, Kidman appeared in a series of postage stamps featuring Australian actors. She, Geoffrey Rush, Russell Crowe, and Cate Blanchett each appear twice in the series: once as themselves and once as their Academy Award-nominated character, Kidman's second stamp showed her as Satine from Moulin Rouge!. On 8 January 2010, alongside Nancy Pelosi, Joan Chen and Joe Torre, Kidman attended the ceremony to help Family Violence Prevention Fund break ground on a new international center located in the Presidio of San Francisco.

Various potential brides were considered: Princess Elisabeth of Modena, Princess Anna of Prussia and Princess Sidonia of Saxony. Although in public life Franz Joseph was the unquestioned director of affairs, in his private life his formidable mother still wielded crucial influence. Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of Habsburg and Wittelsbach--descending from the latter house herself--and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, Helene (\\"Nene\\"), who was four years the Emperor's junior. However, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with Nene's younger sister Elisabeth (\\"Sisi\\"), a beautiful girl of fifteen, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi's appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in St. Augustine's Church, Vienna. Their marriage would prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual and Sisi never truly acclimatised to life at court, frequently having disagreements with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son Rudolf died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous Mayerling Incident. In 1885 Franz Joseph met Katharina Schratt, a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was--to a certain degree--tolerated by Sisi. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in Bad Ischl for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna. Though their relationship lasted for thirty-four years, it remained platonic. The Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion maven who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, Robert of Parma wrote in a letter to his friend Tirso de Olazabal that \\"It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief.\\" Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma he told his relatives: \\"You'll never know how important she was to me\\" or, according to some sources, \\"You will never know how much I loved this woman.\\" Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","response":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article pertaining to the personal life and relationships of Emperor Franz Joseph. Some of these aspects include: 1. The influence of his mother, Sophie, in his private life, and her initial preference for her niece Helene as his bride, instead of Elisabeth. 2. The tumultuous relationship between Franz Joseph and his wife Sisi, marked by their unhappy marriage, disagreements, and their tragic family life, which included the death of their first daughter and the suicide of their only son Rudolf. 3.

Given this information from the text, the sentence can be justified as follows: - The Spies of Warsaw is a fictional story with a historical context. - Spy novels generally involve intriguing storylines, suspense, and drama – elements often seen in movies. - There is also a clear timeline in the story, which could serve as a solid basis for a movie script. Based on these justifications, the answer is: (A). Yes, The Spies of Warsaw could be made into a movie."},{"question":"Why is 50 shades of grey named so? Why is 50 Shades of Grey such a success? Would you say that these questions are the same?","response":"The title \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" has a layered meaning and the origins of the name can be approached from different perspectives. 1. Literal Interpretation: The title can be seen as a reference to the spectrum of grey, which lies between black and white, representing the countless shades of human sexuality, morality, and emotions that the story explores. The term \\"shades\\" is often used to describe the subtle differences and nuances in a subject matter. In the context of the book, it touches on the various dimensions of love, sexual desire, power dynamics, and the complexity of human relationships. 2. Symbolism: The color grey is often associated with ambiguity, complexity, and mystery. The title is an apt reflection of the book's central theme – a passionate and tumultuous relationship between the two main characters, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Christian's last name \\"Grey\\" embodies the novel's main theme by representing a character who is not entirely 'black and white', but a shade of grey – a complex individual who has a mix of good and bad qualities. \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" achieved remarkable success for several reasons: 1. Market Gap: At the time of its release, there was a scarcity of erotic literature in the mainstream market that catered to the fantasies and desires of women. The book tapped into this unmet demand and provided a platform for women to explore their sexual desires and fantasies through the characters and storyline. 2. Word of Mouth and Virality: The book became a viral sensation, with people discussing and sharing their experiences of reading it. Word of mouth played a significant role in spreading awareness about the novel, influencing many to read it themselves. Social media further amplified the book's reach and popularity, fueling its success. 3. Relatability: Many readers found the protagonist, Anastasia Steele, relatable, which contributed to the novel's appeal. Her journey of self-discovery, vulnerability, and exploration of sexual desires resonated with readers, who could relate to her experiences on some level. 4. Taboo Subject: The novel delves into taboo subjects like BDSM and dominant-submissive relationships, which piqued people's curiosity. This novelty factor attracted a massive audience that was eager to explore and understand the world of sexual fetishes and fantasies. 5. Media Coverage and Adaptations: The book received substantial media coverage, further propelling its fame and reach. Its cinematic adaptation into a major film franchise bolstered its success, drawing in audiences who hadn't read the book and generating even more publicity. While the questions \\"Why is 50 Shades of Grey named so?\\" and \\"Why is 50 Shades of Grey such a success?\\" are related, they are not exactly the same. The first question pertains to understanding the symbolism and meaning behind the title of the book, whereas the second question deals with the factors that contributed to the book's phenomenal success. Both questions, however, share a connection in that they explore various aspects of the book which made it a cultural phenomenon."},{"question":"What is the answer to this question? how many episodes of season two of the handmaids tale are there?","response":"Season two of the critically acclaimed, award-winning television series \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" contains a total of 13 episodes.

Here is a transcript of his remarks. OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois... (APPLAUSE) ... crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin- roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. OBAMA: But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that's shown as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before him. (APPLAUSE) While studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. (APPLAUSE) Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton's army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA and later moved west, all the way to Hawaii, in search of opportunity. (APPLAUSE) And they too had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream born of two continents. OBAMA: My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or \\"blessed,\\" believing that in a tolerant America, your name is no barrier to success. (APPLAUSE) They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. (APPLAUSE) They're both passed away now. And yet I know that, on this night, they look down on me with great pride. And I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy; our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal... (APPLAUSE) ... that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\" That is the true genius of America, a faith... (APPLAUSE) ... a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution; and that our votes will be counted -- or at least, most of the time. (APPLAUSE) This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations. OBAMA: And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you, tonight, we have more work to do... (APPLAUSE) ... more work to do, for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now they're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay 7 bucks an hour; more to do for the father I met who was losing his job and chocking back the tears wondering how he would pay 4,500 a months for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her who have the grades, have the drive, have the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college. Now, don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solves all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get a head. And they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you: They don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. (APPLAUSE) Go into any inner-city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn. OBAMA: They know that parents have to teach, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things. (APPLAUSE) People don't expect -- people don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry. (APPLAUSE) John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith and service because they've defined his life. From his heroic service to Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. (APPLAUSE) John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. (APPLAUSE) John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. (APPLAUSE) And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option. (APPLAUSE) You know, a while back, I met a young man named Seamus (ph) in a VFW hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\\", 6'3\\", clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. OBAMA: And as I listened to him explain why he had enlisted -- the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service -- I thought, this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Seamus (ph) as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists. (APPLAUSE) When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Now, let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. (APPLAUSE) John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that we are all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. (APPLAUSE) If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent. (APPLAUSE) If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. (APPLAUSE) It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sisters' keeper -- that makes this country work. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family: \\"E pluribus unum,\\" out of many, one. Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue States: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. We coach little league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. (APPLAUSE) There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism, or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope: In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen, a belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us. America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president. And John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president. And this country will reclaim it's promise. And out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.

Speaking with his former senior adviser and current CNN contributor David Axelrod, Obama said the vision of “one America” he first vocalized in a famous 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention still holds true. “The problem is, it doesn't always manifest itself in politics, right?” the president said. “You know, I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I — if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it.” ADVERTISEMENT Naming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump’s debt deal puts an end to politics as usual in Washington Trump's deal with Schumer, Pelosi should dismay conservatives Congress grapples with disaster aid MORE (R-Ky.) and former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, Obama said Republicans “specifically mobilized a backlash to this vision” of an America united around causes of common good. Obama accused McConnell of acting “very cynically” in rejecting the United States the president tried to bring out. Republicans, he said in the lengthy interview produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics, “can just just throw sand in the gears” and prove disunity through their own actions. “That if we just say no, then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is — is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy.” Obama, then a state senator in Illinois, seized the spotlight at the 2004 convention in Boston with a brief but sweeping speech outlining his own biography and his optimism even \\"in the face of difficulty.” Speaking with Axelrod in the White House, Obama said the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpFeinstein expects public hearing with Donald Trump Jr. 'come hell or high water' Hope Hicks to become Trump’s third White House communications director: report Strange struggles for Trump support in Ala. race MORE does not mean those dreams have failed. “Obviously in the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have — have suggested that somehow, it really was a fantasy,” said Obama, who leaves office in less than a month. “What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and — and full of energy and dynamism.” Trump, who won with an “America first” platform, has repeatedly accused Obama of apologizing for U.S. policy. An early promoter of the “birther” movement, which questioned Obama’s citizenship, Trump has pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and reduce government regulation as part of his campaign pledge to “make America great again.” But Obama said most Americans still subscribe to his own 2008 campaign vision of hope and change. “Now, I would argue that during the entire eight years that I've been president, that spirit of America has still been there in all sorts of ways,” he said. It manifests itself in communities all across the country. \\"We see it in this younger generation that is smarter, more tolerant, more innovative, more creative, more entrepreneurial, would not even think about, you know, discriminating somebody against, for example, because of their sexual orientation.\\" ||||| (CNN) Arguing that Americans still subscribe to his vision of progressive change, President Barack Obama asserted in an interview recently he could have succeeded in this year's election if he was eligible to run. \\"I am confident in this vision because I'm confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\\" Obama told his former senior adviser David Axelrod in an interview for the \\"The Axe Files\\" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. \\"I know that in conversations that I've had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,\\" Obama said in the interview, which aired Monday. \\"In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, it really was a fantasy,\\" Obama said of the hope-and-change vision he heralded in 2008. \\"What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism.\\" Photos: Obama and Axelrod David Axelrod sits backstage with then-US Sen.

Eğer tüm bu gelişmeler meydana gelir ve Bulgaristan ile Romanya önemli ölçüde ekonomik ilerleme sağlarsa, 2007 yılında ikinci bir AB genişlemesi gerçekleşebilir. Bu süreç, Avrupa Birliği'nin daha geniş bir coğrafi alana yayılmasını ve bu ülkelerin siyasi, ekonomik ve sosyal açılardan daha entegre hale gelmesini sağlayacaktır.

Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy, and three of their nine children attained distinguished political positions: President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968), and longtime Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy (1932-2009). He was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. Context: After Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1912 with an A.B. in economics, he took his first job as a state-employed bank examiner; this allowed him to learn a great deal about the banking industry. In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy borrowed 45,000 (1,114,242 today) from family and friends and bought back control. At age 25, he was rewarded by being elected the bank's president. Kennedy told the press he was \\"the youngest\\" bank president in America. Kennedy emerged as a highly successful entrepreneur who had an eye for value. For example, he was real estate investor who turned a handsome profit from ownership of Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., which bought distressed real estate. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson asked the Intercontinental Rubber Company--owned by Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and Kennedy--to grow guayule. Guayule is a plant that produces latex that can be used to make rubber. Many feared the German navy might blockade rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, Intercontinental established the Continental Farm and the little town of Continental in southeastern Arizona in 1916. The guayule growing operations didn't last and in 1922 the Continental Farm was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who rented the fields to cotton farmers for several years. Although he was skeptical of American involvement in the war, Kennedy sought to participate in war-time production as an assistant general manager of a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. There he oversaw the production of transports and warships. Through this job, he became acquainted with Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Question: What kind of career did he begin with?. Whats the answer?","response":"Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. began his career in the finance and banking industry after graduating from Harvard in 1912 with an A.B. in economics. His first job was as a state-employed bank examiner, which allowed him to gain valuable knowledge and experience in the banking sector. In 1913, when the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, faced a potential takeover, Kennedy borrowed 45,000 (1,114,242 today) from family and friends to regain control of the bank. At the age of 25, he was elected as the bank's president, making him one of the youngest bank presidents in America at that time. Kennedy also emerged as a successful entrepreneur and astute investor, making profitable ventures in real estate and other industries. He invested in Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., which bought and turned around distressed real estate properties. During World War I, Kennedy worked in the production sector as an assistant general manager of a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. His involvement in the shipyard led to his acquaintance with Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Moreover, he was a part of the Intercontinental Rubber Company, which was owned by prominent figures like Bernard Baruch and J. P. Morgan. The company was tasked by President Woodrow Wilson to grow guayule – a plant that produces latex for manufacturing rubber – owing to the fear of a German blockade of rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, the company established the Continental Farm in southeastern Arizona in 1916. However, the guayule growing operations did not last, and the farm was sold in 1922. Overall, Joseph Kennedy Sr. started his career in banking and finance, further expanding his expertise into entrepreneurship, investments, real estate, and participating in war-time production. His career pursuits played a vital role in shaping his position in the American business landscape and United States politics."},{"question":"Process: - Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave.

The fifth session of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is taking place in Seoul, where representatives from over 170 international parties will focus on reducing the demand for tobacco. High up the agenda are pricing and tax measures, proposals on limiting tobacco-growing areas, as well policies on economically viable alternatives to the crop. Delegates kick-started the proceedings Monday by adopting a new treaty setting the rules for fighting illegal trade in tobacco products. \\" OPTIONS: - Africa has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - CNN has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - Malawi has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - Seoul has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - South Korea has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - WHO has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - WHO FCTC has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. - World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee.","response":"\\"Malawi has been growing tobacco for over 100 years and yet it is one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" said Saloojee. The statement by Saloojee highlights the pressing need for economically viable alternatives to tobacco farming. Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, has long relied on tobacco as a major cash crop, contributing significantly to the nation's economy. However, despite the substantial profits generated by the tobacco industry, the country's people still struggle with widespread poverty and underdevelopment. This paradox demonstrates the limited scope and long-term challenges associated with a heavy reliance on a single, controversial cash crop like tobacco. As the WHO FCTC aims to tackle the global tobacco crisis, it is essential for the delegates in Seoul to explore and promote alternative agricultural initiatives to support and uplift the economies of countries like Malawi. Diversifying agricultural production and providing new opportunities for growth in other sectors can help create sustainable economic development in these regions. Some potential alternatives to tobacco farming include growing food crops, cultivating biofuels, and investing in horticulture. These alternatives can help reduce the dependency on tobacco farming while creating more stable, inclusive, and resilient economies. For example, in the case of Malawi, soybean cultivation and the production of legumes have been identified as potential alternative crops for small-scale tobacco farmers. These alternative crops can boost food security, improve soil fertility, and reduce dependence on fertilizers. Moreover, they can contribute to the overall sustainability of the country's agricultural system. The move towards alternative crops not only has the potential to uplift local economies but also contributes to global efforts to reduce tobacco consumption and its associated health risks. By offering tangible economic alternatives, WHO FCTC can support the tobacco-dependent nations in gradually shifting away from the production and sale of the harmful crop, ultimately leading to better well-being and quality of life for their citizens. In conclusion, the discussions and decisions taken at the WHO FCTC in Seoul should aim to recognize the complex realities and challenges faced by countries like Malawi, which have been historically reliant on tobacco farming, and work towards creating potential pathways for sustainable economic growth in these regions."},{"question":"Write a negative yelp review.","response":"Step 1: Choose a business and service to write a negative review for In this case, let's choose a local restaurant and focus on the aspects of dining experience, such as food quality, service, and cleanliness.

The hostess seemed rather irritable and made no effort to attend to our seating preference. When our orders arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes (and taste buds). The chicken dish I ordered was severely undercooked, posing a health risk that I cannot ignore. This was not only a major letdown in terms of food quality, but also an indication of the lack of attention being paid to the food preparation process.

The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: CHAPTER REVIEW 4.1 Types of Tissues The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be classified into four types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the surface. Connective tissue integrates the various parts of the body and provides support and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate information. The study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the body derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Different types of tissues form membranes that enclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction between organs, and keep organs together.

Economic opportunities: If Lakeside experiences economic growth, such as new businesses, job opportunities, or an overall positive economic environment, it could attract more people to move to the town and increase its population. 2. Infrastructure and public services: As a town develops and expands its infrastructure, such as public transportation, schools, hospitals, and recreational facilities, it becomes more attractive to potential residents. If Lakeside invests in its infrastructure and public services, it could experience population growth. 3. Housing availability and affordability: The availability of housing, as well as its affordability, can greatly impact population growth. If Lakeside offers affordable housing options to attract new residents, this could contribute to population growth. 4.

The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Input: Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948) knew that. The emigre artist moved to Ambleside via Norway in 1945 having fled Germany after Hitler included his Dadaist collages in the Nazis's Degenerate Art (Entartete Kunst) exhibitions. Schwitters called his assemblages made from magazine cuttings and assorted debris, \\"Merz\\", an invented word to describe his carefully arranged collection of bit-n-bobs. Soon after he set up shop in the Lake District, he began the protracted process of transforming a humble stone barn into a Merzbau: a dwelling-cum-sculpture-cum-installation fabricated from twigs, string, wire, plaster and pretty much anything that came to hand. But the Cumbrian climate undermined his efforts; rainwater poured through the construction. Schwitters was thwarted by the weather, and by his failing health. He died mid-project, leaving behind a leaky barn and a lasting legacy for low-fi art made with \\"found\\" objects. His influence is evident in Robert Rauschenberg's Combines and Monty Python's animations; in the aesthetics of punk and the pioneering pop art of Eduardo Paolozzi. Amazing, really - that Schwitters, a somewhat eccentric artist from Hanover whose work was, on occasion, destroyed and ridiculed, who became destitute and sickly, should possess a vision so potent and vital that it continues to resonate right up to this very week. If I was a betting man, I'd wager that you have heard of Kanye West - who released a new track called Wash Us In The Blood on Tuesday - but probably not Arthur Jafa who made the accompanying video, although he's been around much longer and was awarded the Golden Lion at last year's Venice Art Biennale. Back in 1991, when Kanye was still in high school, Jafa won the cinematography award at the Sundance Film Festival for Daughters of the Dust. He then worked with Spike Lee and Stanley Kubrick way before West collaborated with Jay-Z on The Blueprint. But then Kanye stepped into the limelight in 2004 with his debut album College Dropout, while Arthur stayed behind the camera working mainly as a cinematographer on movies and pop promos. Their stars aligned in 2016 when Jafa was busy piecing together a bunch of video clips and stills he'd harvested from the internet. In the spirit of Schwitters, they were fragments of stuff that had caught his eye, which he thought could be seen differently, or just seen, if structured into a coherent form from a dense mass of footage: carved out like a sculpture. The images the Mississippi-born, architect-trained Jafa selected, coalesced into a melancholic meditation on the African American experience. There's a clip of Barack Obama singing Amazing Grace at a service for Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was murdered in Charleston in 2015. That lasts a few seconds. Then, a little boy slaps his mother's face and shouts, \\"Mummy, wake up!\\", Michael Jordan is on court, a young woman twerks, Martin Luther King smiles, the molten surface of the sun burns, The Notorious B.I.G raps; all of this and much more in a seven-minute-plus compilation regularly interspersed with shocking scenes of police and racists brutally assaulting black citizens. Jafa had the video close to finished when he sat down one evening to watch Saturday Night Live, with Kanye West as the musical guest. The second number he performed, accompanied by a large choir, was the gospel-inflected Ultralight Beam. Jafa was astonished by it: a masterpiece, he thought - immediately adding it to his film. He was struck by how well it fitted, not only the mood, but also the selected images. Job done. He called his completed work Love is the Message, The Message is Death and showed it to his friend Kahlil Joseph, who showed it at the Underground Museum in LA, and then at Art Basle in Switzerland, where the gallerist Gavin Brown saw it, and showed it in New York, at which point a video Jafa was originally going to simply upload to YouTube was re-contextualised as a museum-quality work of art and quickly became an icon of the age. Maybe the same would have happened if Jafa had posted it online, but I wouldn't bet on it. As with Kurt Schwitters, Arthur Jafa was sourcing seemingly random, buried or discarded entities that had unconsciously caught his eye, and bringing them to the surface where they could be seen. Unlike Schwitters, he was doing it with images that wouldn't have existed in the German's time or even a decade or so ago. The smart-phone films of police brutality have only become possible because of 21st Century technology. Before the ever-present camera-phone existed, extreme and illegal acts of violence perpetrated by officers of the law were mostly unrecorded and therefore open to debate. They're not any more. Love is the Message, The Message is Death is an artwork crafted from this new medium, which presents a view of the world that has never, could never, have been seen before. Last weekend it was simultaneously shown by 13 museums across the globe on their websites. On Tuesday Kanye West posted Wash Us In The Blood, a single from his forthcoming album God's Country, with a video by Jafa. It could be read as Love is the Message: The Sequel, which is a damning indictment of the continued violence targeted at a community of people because of the colour of their skin. There's a clip of Ahmaud Arbery jogging shortly before he was shot and killed after being confronted by Gregory McMichael and his son Travis. And one of Breonna Taylor laughing and dancing at some point prior to the incident that led to her death having been shot eight times by police. Both fatal confrontations happened this spring. There are also Covid-19 references, two of which show footage of young black people struggling to breathe, a comment, perhaps, on the nature of the virus and how it affects different ethnicities and also, possibly, on the asphyxiation of George Floyd, a protest about which is where the film starts (in Fort Lauderdale after a policeman has gratuitously pushed over a kneeling black woman). There are cars doing donuts and taking out a section of the crowd, chains on the ocean that take the shape of Peter Saville's Unknown Pleasures album cover for Joy Division, and video game sequences in a split-screen with Kanye, whose head is covered in a clear plastic visual effect that shatters as he sings about people not wanting him to be himself. All of this imagery is secondary to Kanye's music and lyrics, which mixes polemic with prayer and biblical references: Genocide what it does Mass incarc' what it does Shortly followed by: Execution, thirty states Thirty states still execute Thou shall not kill, I shall not spill. And then… Wash us in the blood of Jesus. The hectic, driving urgency of the film and track subside at the end as pictures of Kanye's Sunday Service Choir rehearsing are accompanied by the sound of gospel singing. It is a good film. But it is not as good as Love is the Message, The Message is Death, or The White Album - the video about casual racism for which Jafa won at Venice. Wash Us In The Blood is clearly part of his oeuvre, a way of making art that Arthur Jafa has been perfecting since he was a little boy putting together books of Kung-Fu movie adverts. But it lacks the rhythm and clarity of his best work. I suspect that is because the video is ultimately in service to the song, whereas the music is an afterthought in Love is the Message. There is also an over-reliance on images and characters Jafa has used in previous pieces, perhaps because he thought a new mass audience might be unfamiliar with his earlier work. The trouble is, for those who are familiar with it, the sense of shock and discovery and sensory overload, on which his videos rely, is undermined. So, this is not his finest work. But Arthur Jafa remains an exceptional artist - or \\"specialist\\", as he would say - whose star within the art world has risen late but shines brighter than most. He might not be as famous as Kanye right now, but he will be in 100 years' time when he will be considered one of the most important artists of the early 21st Century. I'll take bets on it.

Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964, when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters, and the half dollar was reduced to 40% silver. Silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970. Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt. The gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains (0.888 g), equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at 35. This standard persisted until 1968.\\" Answer: The answer is:","response":"In 1965, the gold standard was worth 35 per troy ounce of gold. To understand the context and changes that led to this value, it is essential to trace the significant events and steps, as mentioned earlier. The Gold Standard Act of 1900 marked a critical shift in the US monetary system by abandoning the bimetallic standard (using both gold and silver) and defining the dollar as 23.22 grains (around 1.505 grams) of gold. Consequently, the price of 1 troy ounce of gold was set at 20.67. Although silver coins continued to be minted for circulation until 1964, their role gradually diminished as gold increasingly demonstrated its dominance in the monetary system. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which prohibited the private ownership of gold and mandated the confiscation of gold coins. In effect, this move significantly transformed the relationship between gold and the US dollar. The gold standard was then redefined; the dollar was now pegged to 13.71 grains (approximately 0.888 grams) of gold, which translated to a value of 35 for 1 troy ounce of gold. This change persisted until 1968. Although the gold standard saw further changes over the years, particularly throughout the 1970s, the specific year in question, 1965, had the gold standard set at 35 for 1 troy ounce of gold. It is crucial to note that this was a period of transition for US coinage. In 1964, silver was removed from dimes and quarters, while the silver content in half dollars was reduced to 40%.

Plot title: The General Movie plot: Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad train engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton) is in Marietta, Georgia to see one of the two loves of his life, his fiancee Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack)âthe other being his locomotive, The Generalâwhen the American Civil War breaks out. He hurries to be first in line to sign up with the Confederate Army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job; unfortunately, Johnnie is not told this reason and is forcibly ejected from the office when he tries to enlist surreptitiously. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he sadly walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist. Annabelle coldly informs Johnnie that she will not speak to him again until he is in uniform. A year passes, and Annabelle receives word that her father has been wounded. She travels north on the General to see him but still wants nothing to do with Johnnie. When the train makes a stop, the passengers detrain for a quick meal. As planned, Union spies led by Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender) use the opportunity to steal the train. Annabelle becomes an inadvertent prisoner. Johnnie gives chase, first on foot, then by handcar and boneshaker bicycle, before reaching a station in Chattanooga. He alerts the army detachment there, which boards another train to give chase, with Johnnie manning the locomotive, the Texas. However, the flatcars are not hooked up to the engine, and the troops are left behind. By the time Johnnie realizes he is alone, it is too late to turn back. The Union agents try a variety of methods to shake their dogged pursuer (convinced he is accompanied by Confederate soldiers), including disconnecting their trailing car and dropping railroad ties on the tracks.

Article: Who do you think breaks the law in our society? If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes, you may have to think again. Unlike in the movies, we can't divide the world into bad guys and model citizens. _ In the same way that diseases range from the common cold to fatal forms of cancer, crimes vary in degree. For example, smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people, but much less than threatening them with a gun. In addition to breaking the law themselves, people tolerate various levels of crime. Why can we tolerate some crimes? It may be that, by seeing others do something, we accept it more easily. For instance, most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit. When people celebrate a sports championship, if they see someone breaking store windows, they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal from the store. So the people around us influence how much law-breaking we can tolerate. We must also wonder whether seeing violence on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should. We become used to seeing blood on the news on television, or in full color in newspapers and magazines. Because we see thousands of dead people on TV, maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence. If so many citizens tolerate violence and crime, or even commit crimes themselves, it may simply be because of the human mind. Our minds may not care about specific laws. Instead, our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives. Yet, when it comes to respecting the rights of a mass of anonymous individuals, we might not be so responsible. While most people would not steal a wallet containing 50, they may not mind cheating on taxes, because cheating on taxes does not hurt any one person. It hurts society, but \\"society\\" remains an abstract idea that is not as real as a neighbor or a friend's friend. When we realize that so...

Eric had to make sure to stay close to bathrooms but not Kevin because Pick your answer from: -Eric did not have Giardiasis.. -Kevin did not have Giardiasis.. Answer:","response":"Kevin did not have Giardiasis. As a result, Eric was more concerned with being near restrooms, since he was dealing with the effects of the parasitic infection known as Giardiasis. This ailment caused him great discomfort and inconvenience, as it led to symptoms such as diarrhea, gas, greasy stool, stomach cramps, and bloating. Therefore, whenever he and Kevin went out together, he took care to choose locations with accessible, clean bathroom facilities, while Kevin didn't need to worry about this aspect. On the other hand, Kevin enjoyed the freedom of not having Giardiasis, and was able to explore and engage in various activities without the need to keep track of the nearest restroom. He was mindful, though, of the challenges Eric faced and tried to be supportive and understanding of his friend's circumstances. The two of them had always been close, and Kevin was willing to adapt their activities and outings to accommodate Eric's needs. Additionally, they both made sure to take proper steps to prevent the further spread of Giardiasis, as it is a highly contagious disease transmitted through contaminated food or water, or contact with an infected individual. While Eric was undergoing treatment for Giardiasis, he and Kevin educated themselves about the risk factors and prevention strategies for this illness. They learned that measures such as practicing good hygiene, washing their hands thoroughly and regularly, and being cautious when consuming food and water in unfamiliar areas could significantly reduce the risk of getting infected. Eric hoped that his experience with Giardiasis would serve as a valuable lesson for both him and Kevin, and they would emerge from this ordeal with greater awareness and vigilance when it came to protecting their health. In the end, Kevin's ability to empathize with and support Eric through his bout with Giardiasis only strengthened their friendship. They knew they could rely on each other no matter what life threw their way, and they were grateful for the bond they shared. Over time, as Eric recovered from the infection, they were able to resume their normal activities without the constant need for nearby restrooms. However, the memories of this challenging period served as a stark reminder of the importance of good health, and they never took it for granted again."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A group of scientists at a top secret research center in the Phillippines are experimenting with a chemical compound called 'Death One'.

Directed by Joe Pretentious, this film fails abysmally in every conceivable way. Dreadful direction, tasteless writing, and abysmal acting are just a few elements that make this film a perfect storm of disappointment. It is quite honestly mind-boggling to think a single movie could be this unbearable. The story revolves around the life of Smith Dullard (played by Tom Standardo), a bland office worker whose life spirals out of control as he faces a series of nauseatingly predictable challenges, included but not limited to an unfaithful wife, his children's lack of respect, and a tumultuous workplace. While the plot had the potential to tackle some deep and meaningful themes, it ends up feeling more like a selection of clichés strung together by a sleep-deprived screenwriter. As the audience, we are plagued with one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and unnecessary subplots that only serve to lengthen the excruciating run-time. Jane Flatline's portrayal of Smith's wife, Michelle, is remarkably unconvincing, leaving the viewer utterly apathetic toward her struggles and redemption arc. The sheer mediocrity of the performances is not helped by Peter Uninteresting's resounding lack of charisma as Smith's best friend. The dialogue of The Disappointment's Disappointment feels as if it was written by someone who has only ever consumed parodic examples of the drama genre. Any attempt at humor fails catastrophically, further diminishing what little possibility there was for audiences to enjoy this narrative slog. The tension that crucially underpins a good drama flick is notably absent, leaving the viewer frantically searching for any semblance of a pulse. Visually, the film seems lethargic and averse to risk-taking. Ostentatious and unnecessary camera movements disconnect the viewer from the story, while the gloomy color palette only adds to the numbness. The use of overly melodramatic music aims to manipulate our emotions, but instead just feels like a desperate attempt to salvage this already irreparably sunk ship. The editing seems to have been done with no regard for pacing or tonal consistency. The film stumbles from one disjointed scene to the next with little sense of rhythm, making it difficult to engage with the characters or empathize with their struggles. The climax, if it can even be called that, leaves audiences with more questions than answers and no resolution worth celebrating. In conclusion, The Disappointment's Disappointment reeks of mediocrity and is an exercise in wasted potential. What could have been a thought-provoking drama turned out to be a cobbled together collection of mind-numbing clichés, wholly uninterested performances, and tedious technical execution. This film is best left to the annals of history, serving as a warning to future filmmakers about the dangers of complacency and hubris. I cannot recommend this film to anyone with even a vague awareness of their own taste, or simply put, stay clear of The Disappointment's Disappointment, and save yourself from further disappointment."},{"question":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?

She finds a stand where a mother and her daughter work; they sell gifts to Marie for a dollar. Her lover Didier (Thierry Neuvic) looks over the balcony and witnesses the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami coming into shore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She grabs hold of the girl and runs away from the shore but is quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a near-death experience in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the mother and daughter holding hands. Marie and Didier are soon reunited as the disaster subsides and they return to Paris. Marie's experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sends her on a leave of absence to write the book they've discussed, which would add to her prestige.

Once fully dehydrated, it’s very difficult for bacteria to form, creating a food that can last for weeks or months without refrigeration. The content of the food, including fiber content and calories, stays the same with dehydrating (except for a loss of Vitamin C in some foods because of its solubility). With a food dehydrator, available at some grocery stores and at many places online, you can preserve fruits, vegetables, and meats. If you don’t want to buy a dehydrator, you can also get the same effect from a low-temperature oven. Use the oven on the lowest possible setting, place your food on a non-stick pan, and use a small fan to keep the air circulating and prevent any moisture buildup. The process takes all of the liquid out of the foods, preserving it in a new, chewier form. Once dehydrated, you can store these foods without refrigeration for weeks. Dehydrating is particularly good for backpacking trips or other times when you need to carry your food with you. . Smoked meats have been a way for people to preserve food for thousands of years. The kinds of wood for the fire and the spices you put on the meat itself can create an array of delicious flavors on the meat. There are two kinds of smoking – hot and cold. The differences are as follows: When you smoke meat using the “hot” method, you are cooking it at a low temperature (150 degrees Fahrenheit and up) for a long time. The “cold” method, on the other hand, is at less than 100 °F (37.8 °C) and is not really meant to cook the meat at all, but rather to seal the meat enough so that bacteria cannot grow in it. This method works particularly well if you’re planning to cook the meat at some other point in the future. . Like smoking, curing is a process that has been around for thousands of years. The process involves using salt to leach the water out of meat, essentially dehydrating it. There are two main ways of curing meats: Dry curing involves rubbing the meat with salt and sodium nitrite and other spices of your choosing. The meat is then typically hung to dry. For safety, it’s best to purchase a prepared mixture of salt and nitrate -- the amount should be about 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds of meat, but follow any directions on the mix that dictate amounts. Wet curing or brining also uses salt, but in a liquid solution. Meat is placed into a “brine” made of water, salt, sodium nitrite, and other spices to cure. The typical mixture is about 1 ¼ cups of kosher salt per gallon of water.","response":"This article talks about ways to make food last longer without using a refrigerator.

It is a type of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, which occurs when the heart's ventricles contract earlier than they should, interrupting the regular heartbeat cycle. The ventricles are the lower chambers of the heart that pump blood to the rest of the body. Normally, the heart has an organized and synchronized rhythm of contractions, but in some cases, this rhythm can be disrupted. There are several potential triggers for PVCs, such as stress, anxiety, caffeine or alcohol intake, drug use, and certain medical conditions like an electrolyte imbalance or heart-related issues. In addition, PVCs can also be idiopathic, which means they occur without an identifiable cause. Patients who experience Premature Ventricular Contractions may feel palpitations, skipped beats, fluttering, or an irregular heartbeat. However, they can also be asymptomatic, making the PVCs difficult to detect without medical tests like an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a Holter monitor. Although most PVCs are generally considered benign and do not require extensive treatment, they can sometimes signify more serious heart conditions or increase the risk of other complications. When PVCs are frequent, sustained, or symptomatic, further investigations are needed to assess if there is any underlying structural heart disease. Treatment or management of PVCs depends on the underlying cause and severity of the symptoms. In some cases, lifestyle changes might be recommended, like reducing stress, avoiding caffeine and nicotine, and modifying alcohol intake. For those with a high burden of PVCs, medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed. In more severe cases where PVCs are related to other significant heart conditions or when medications fail, procedures like radiofrequency catheter ablation can be performed to correct the abnormal electrical pathways.

West Ham enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure after that and deserved Chiekhou Kouyate's equaliser. Kouyate hit the post in the second half, but King turned in Jamie Vardy's mis-hit shot with four minutes to play. It was the Wales midfielder's first goal of the season, and ended Leicester's run of eight league matches without a win, stretching back to 10 January. Nigel Pearson's side remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety, but the attacking threat they showed will give their manager hope that they can yet avoid the drop. Pearson's need for victories prompted him to play an extra attacking midfielder in Riyad Mahrez, rather than bring in a direct replacement for injured centre-back Matthew Upson. The result was a first-half display full of attacking vigour, but marked by defensive vulnerability. Leicester's decision to bring on Marc Albrighton for Mahrez at half-time did at least reduce the threat that Aaron Cresswell had been providing down the West Ham left, although both teams continued to create openings in a terrific match. The hosts should have been two goals up inside the first 15 minutes of a breathless contest, yet could have been behind by the break. Cambiasso's strike gave them the ideal start, as he steered a shot into the corner after Nugent's attempted pass had bounced off the back of defender James Collins. Within moments, Hammers full-back Carl Jenkinson conceded a penalty with a mistimed sliding challenge on Leonardo Ulloa, but keeper Adrian - who looked to have come off his line early - dived to his left to save Nugent's spot-kick. The visitors had several chances to equalise before they did, eventually scoring when Jeffrey Schlupp got underneath Alex Song's diagonal ball in, leaving Kouyate unmarked to control and finish at the far post. The final 25 minutes brought a glut of opportunities at both ends, with Leicester substitute Jamie Vardy passing up three in quick succession. West Ham rode that spell of pressure to create several good openings of their own, the best of which ended with Kouyate hitting the post after being set up by Diafra Sakho. Kasper Schmeichel made a terrific flying save to tip over Downing's deflected shot, and Jenkinson headed Morgan Amalfitano's cross straight at the Leicester keeper. But in a gripping finish, Andrej Kramaric had a shot cleared off the line moments before fellow substitute King scrambled in a winner to Pearson's delight. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson: \\"In the first half, we got off to a good start and missed a penalty - and I think the players had a moment of doubting themselves. \\"That allowed West Ham to have a dominant spell. But in the second half, we did a good job of taking the initiative again, and I think we deserved to win the game.\\" West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: \\"I just can't believe we missed so many chances. When you're in control of the game, you have to take the chances when you get them. \\"Against a team battling for survival such as Leicester, if you get the lead, it kills them. They start to think: 'Here we go again.' That's how ruthless you have to be. Because we didn't do that, it gave them the chance.\\" Match ends, Leicester City 2, West Ham United 1.

After a long weekend, there's nothing like hitting the taco shop for a quick treat. Roberto's is no different. This one is close to my neighborhood so I frequent it quite often. Those of you who go to Roberto's know that a lot of em aren't that clean, and this one is getting there. But right now it's not so bad. Not-the-cleanest-place-in-the-world aside....this place has GREAT food! Our fav is the nachos with carne asada. They take a plate of tortilla chips, smother it with cheddar and Mexican queso then put a HUGE serving of steak on top. It also gets the guacamole and sour cream treatment. So amazingly ONO! Too bad it's a bit greasy...and they tend to not give you enough chips. The ratio of meat and cheese to chips is a little off....like only 1 layer of chips for 4 layers of chees and meat. No matter though when you're hungry and it tastes good. And it only sets you back about 6, and can feed at least 2 folks. Another one of my favs are the tortas, sort of a Mexican sandwich if you will. You can choose to put shredded chicken or beef, carne asada, machaca, or carnitas in them. The chicken and beef ones are 3, and the carne asada and carnitas ones are 3.95. Anyway, the meat goes on one of their oval shaped Mexican buns (which is grilled to make it crispy) and gets the fixings of some lettuce, guacamole, and salsa. They're pretty good, but watch out because the meat can be hot! I nearly burned myself the last time. They also got a lot of different combo platters as well, all ranging from the 4 - 7 range. They have tacos (the shell makes em great), enchilada, burritos, rolled tacos (taquitos to you), all kinds of stuff. Their big attraction is their salsa bar though. They got your basic mild green tomatillo salsa, and their hot red salsa. Don't get them mixed up on your first visit like I did years ago! Red is HOT, no Pico Di Gallo! Both go with your food quite well. They also have pickled carrots & onions on the bar (so nice), along with fresh cucumbers, green onions(still uncut on the stalk!), and cut limes. The gf's kids love the Mexican drinks on tap with unlimited refills if you eat in: Horchata (their fav-it's like Cinnamon Milk), Tamarindo (tamarind), Pina (almost like pina colada), and Jamaica (tastes like Jamaicans, just kidding! it's actually Hibiscus tea). The drinks compliment your food in a way you wouldn't think it could. Most Roberto's are open 24 hours a day (could be the reason why a lot of em are surrounded by bulletproof glass at the counter-keep off robbers) and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Their breakfast burritos are killer! The service may not be greatest or the quickest (sometimes the person taking your order doesn't know much English) but that's no problem. Just say EXACTLY what you want from the menu the way it's listed on there. The people at the one I go to are nice and courteous and treat us like regulars (well...because we are I guess). Don't forget to check your mail for the Valpak envelope, there's almost ALWAYS a coupon for Roberto's. The last one I got had a beef taco for 1, and 5 rolled tacos (with tons of cheese and guacamole on top) and a 20 oz. soda for 5.50. Very good for the price. So the next time you get a craving for some fast Mexican, forget Taco Bell and go for some Roberto's!","response":"To analyze the sentiment of the review, I will break it down into various aspects discussed and identify positive or negative sentiments for each: 1.

Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim.

Context: You may have read some of the scary research recently that links parabens (a preservative ingredient found in loads of health and beauty products) with breast cancer, and whilst there is no evidence yet to prove that using parabens causes breast cancer more and more people are choosing to ditch parabens in favour of something more natural. I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.

These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - The Milwaukee Road 's class F7 comprised six ( # 100 -- # 105 ) high - speed , streamlined 4 - 6 - 4 \`\` Baltic '' or \`\` Hudson '' type steam locomotives built by Alco in 1937 -- 38 to haul the Milwaukee 's Hiawatha express passenger trains . Following on from the success of the road 's class A 4 - 4 - 2s , the F7s allowed the road to haul heavier trains on the popular Chicago -- Twin Cities routes . The F7s are major contenders for the fastest steam locomotives ever built , as they ran at over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) daily . One run in January 1941 recorded by a reporter for Trains magazine saw 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) achieved twice -- in the midst of a heavy snowstorm . Baron Gérard Vuillet , a French railroading expert , once recorded a run between Chicago and Milwaukee where the locomotive reached 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) and sustained an average 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) for 4.5 miles ( 7.2 km ) . However , the British locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is officially accepted to be the world 's fastest , with a run recorded at 125.88 mph ( 202.58 km / h ) in 1938 . The Milwaukee F7s are accepted as the fastest steam locomotives by a different measure -- scheduled speed between stations . In 1939 , shortly after they were introduced into passenger service , the Twin Cities Hiawatha schedule was modified such that the engines would need to run the 78.3 mi ( 126.0 km ) between Portage and Sparta , Wisconsin in 58 minutes -- a start - to - stop average of 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) . First - built # 100 was also the first withdrawn from service , on November 10 , 1949 ; last - built # 105 was the final one in service , withdrawn August 10 , 1951 . All were scrapped . - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels. In France, where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic, while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America. What is the relationship between 'milwaukee road class f7' and 'steam engine'? A:","response":"The relationship between 'Milwaukee Road Class F7' and 'steam engine' lies in the fact that the Milwaukee Road Class F7 is a specific type of steam locomotive that utilizes a steam engine for its propulsion. As a steam locomotive, the Class F7 relies on the combustion of fuel, such as coal or oil, to produce steam in a boiler which then powers the main wheels (drivers) through reciprocating pistons. Milwaukee Road Class F7 comprises six high-speed, streamlined 4-6-4 \\"Baltic\\" or \\"Hudson\\" type steam locomotives. These locomotives were built by Alco in 1937-38 to haul the Milwaukee Road's Hiawatha express passenger trains. The F7s were designed to allow the Milwaukee Road to haul heavier trains on the popular Chicago-Twin Cities routes with speeds over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) daily. The Milwaukee Road Class F7 locomotives are considered to be some of the fastest steam locomotives ever built. In summary, the Milwaukee Road Class F7 is a particular class of steam locomotives that employ a steam engine for power generation and propulsion. This class of steam locomotives achieved remarkable speeds, making them prominent examples in the history of steam-powered railway transportation."},{"question":"Q:\\"The Orchard of Lost Souls\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","response":"To examine whether it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's first analyze and understand both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: Gross national saving is a good indicator of resources available both to The premise implies that gross national saving is a reliable measure to assess the resources available to a nation. Gross national saving is the sum of personal saving, corporate saving, and governmental saving, which is the difference between a nation's income and its spending, including consumption and investments by the public and private sectors. When gross national saving is high, it indicates that the nation is producing more than it consumes and that it has resources to share, invest, or lend. Conversely, when gross national saving is low, it suggests that the nation is consuming more than it produces and may need to borrow resources from other countries, leading to potential economic challenges. Hypothesis: Gross national saving shows if a country has remaining resources. The hypothesis states that gross national saving provides information about whether a country has resources left over. In this context, \\"remaining resources\\" probably refer to the overall availability of resources not immediately consumed in the economy, including factors such as the accumulation of capital, external assets, or potential funds for future investment projects and economic development. Now, let's consider whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. If we accept the premise that gross national saving is a good indicator of resources available both to a nation, then we can infer that a higher gross national saving would mean that a nation has adequate resources remaining. In this case, when the gross national saving rises, the amount of remaining resources in the economy goes up. This would mean that countries with high gross national saving are more likely to have higher remaining resources. Similarly, if we accept the premise, we can also infer that a lower gross national saving would mean that a nation has fewer resources remaining. In this case, when the gross national saving falls, the amount of remaining resources in the economy goes down. This would mean that countries with low gross national saving are less likely to have significant remaining resources. Thus, considering the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Gross national saving can indeed show if a country has remaining resources, as a high gross national saving rate indicates the presence of available resources not immediately consumed by the nation, while a low gross national saving rate suggests that the nation may have fewer resources left over. This conclusion relies on accepting the premise that gross national saving is a reliable indicator of resources available to a country and understanding that remaining resources refer to the overall availability of unconsumed resources that can be used for various purposes in the economy."},{"question":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

For example, if you’re trying to find a weighted average for a series of grades in a class, first write down each of the grades. For instance, maybe your total grades are 82 for quizzes, 90 on your exam, and 76 on your term paper. Once you have your numbers, you’ll need to know how much each of them weighs, or is worth, as part of your final average. For instance, in your class, the quizzes might be worth 20% of your total grade, while the exam is 35% and the term paper is 45%. In this case, the weights add up to 1 (or 100%). In order to use these percentages in your calculation, you’ll need to convert them to decimal form. The resulting numbers are called “weighting factors.” Once you have all your numbers, pair up each number (x) with its corresponding weighting factor (w). You’ll be multiplying each set of numbers and weights together, then adding them all up to find the average. For example, if your total quiz score is 82 and quizzes are worth 20% of your grade, multiply 82 x 0.2. In this case, x=82 and w=0.2. The basic formula for a weighted average where the weights add up to 1 is x1(w1) + x2(w2) + x3(w3), and so on, where x is each number in your set and w is the corresponding weighting factor. To find your weighted average, simply multiply each number by its weight factor and then sum the resulting numbers up. For example: The weighted average for your quiz grades, exam, and term paper would be as follows: 82(0.2) + 90(0.35) + 76(0.45) = 16.4 + 31.5 + 34.2 = 82.1. This means you have a grade of 82.1% in the course.","response":"To find a weighted average, first, write down the numbers you want to average, like your grades: quizzes (82), exam (90), and term paper (76).

Now, multiply each grade by its worth, like 82 x 0.2, and add all the results together: 16.4 + 31.5 + 34.2 = 82.1.

His lawyer MacCaulay would receive phone calls instructing him to give large sums of money to Julia, who claimed that she saw him often and was acting on his orders. But Julia was suspected to be not only cheating on Clyde, but also stealing from him, for gangster boyfriend Joe Morelli.And the Wynant family was as happy as Nick last left them. Clyde's affair with Julia gave wife Mimi good grounds for divorce and endless opportunities to pester him for money; even after her marriage to Chris Jorgenson, a penniless man living off his wife and her ex-husband's money. Clyde's son Gilbert was an eccentric bookworm, with little thoughts for his own family. His daughter Dorothy was close to him, and engaged to be married to Tommy. Dorothy was having a secret struggle with Mimi and was the first Wynant to come and ask for Nick's help.Mimi had gone to see Julia on the day she died, and was the first to find her dead. Mimi recognised the watch chain...

(i) negative; (ii) positive; Short movie review: haphazardness Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","response":"From the given information, it appears that the critic is thinking negatively of the movie. The term \\"haphazardness\\" suggests disorganization, lack of order, or planning, which are generally considered to be undesirable traits in a movie. Although a short review, the word choice here indicates dissatisfaction with some aspect(s) of the film. A longer, more detailed review might look like this: Title: Haphazardness - A Chaotic Cinematic Experience Review: Haphazardness, a film that had the potential to enthrall its viewers with its unique premise, unfortunately falls disappointingly short of expectations. The title itself appears to be an accurate description of the disorganization and lack of order that permeates the film. One of the most jarring issues with Haphazardness is its disjointed narrative. While nonlinear storytelling can be employed effectively to create intrigue and suspense, the movie's convoluted plotline only serves to confuse and disengage the viewer. The transitions between scenes are abrupt, and critical elements of the storyline are often left unclear or entirely unexplained. In addition to the mishandled narrative, Haphazardness is marred by inconsistent character development. The protagonists appear to undergo dramatic shifts in personality, motivation, and decision-making, seemingly at random. This lack of continuity results in characters who are difficult for the audience to connect with or invest in emotionally. The film's technical aspects, while occasionally showing flashes of brilliance, ultimately fail to save it from its structural shortcomings. The cinematography is at times captivating but is often marred by erratic and confusing choices in camera angles and movements. The soundtrack, although featuring some standout tracks, is jarringly mismatched to the on-screen action and mainly serves to contribute to the overall sense of disorder. Despite a few moments of poignant dialogue and some gripping action sequences, Haphazardness ultimately cannot rise above the chaos of its own design. The film's disorganized approach to storytelling and character development, along with several questionable technical choices, leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied and longing for what could have been if the creative forces behind the movie had opted for a more structured and cohesive vision. In conclusion, the critic's use of the term \\"haphazardness\\" indicates a negative assessment of the film, primarily due to its disorganization, lack of order, and poor execution of its premise and characters. This brief review, while limited in scope, successfully communicates the critic's dissatisfaction with the movie, and puts forth the recommendation to approach this cinematic experience with caution or consider other options for more fulfilling entertainment."},{"question":"Question 1: How do I know if a guy like me?

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","response":"To determine the most reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of finding an impromptu or makeshift crochet stick, here are some possible alternatives: 1. Chopsticks 2. Thick skewers or wooden dowels 3. Pencils or pens with rounded edges Step 1: Assess the availability of each alternative. - Chopsticks: See if you have any takeout or disposable chopsticks around the house. - Thick skewers/wooden dowels: Look for skewers in your kitchen or wooden dowels in your toolbox or craft supplies. - Pencils/pens with rounded edges: Verify if there are any available in your desk or workspace. Step 2: Evaluate the viability of each alternative. - Chopsticks: These are often made of wood or bamboo, which are smooth and suitable for crochet. They typically have a tapered end, which can work to catch and pull the yarn. - Thick skewers/wooden dowels: They may be suitable if they are thick enough for the yarn and project size. The ends may need to be sanded or filed down to create a smooth surface and a slight taper. - Pencils/pens with rounded edges: Pencils or pens with smooth, rounded edges could work, but the lack of a taper may make it slightly more difficult to catch and pull the yarn. Also, writing instruments might be uncomfortable to grip for long periods. Step 3: Choose the most reasonable method. Based on the assessment of the alternatives and their viability, using chopsticks as makeshift crochet sticks seems to be the most reasonable method. They have the most suitable shape and material, are commonly available in households, and require little to no modification. However, the best option still depends on individual circumstances and what items are readily accessible within a specific context."},{"question":"Given the question: Determine the topic of the passage. \\"The series follows local politician Mel Burke (Melissa Joan Hart) and Joe Longo (Joey Lawrence), whom Mel hires to look after her niece and nephew after a Ponzi scheme leaves him broke.\\" Topic: The answer is:","response":"The topic of the passage revolves around the premise of a television series, featuring a local politician and her newly-hired nanny navigating through challenging situations involving family dynamics and overcoming personal financial struggles due to a Ponzi scheme.

Options: - oil machine with grease - oil engine - machine parts - machine tool - tools The answer is \\"machine parts\\" because Answer:","response":"As a mechanic, one is likely to order \\"machine parts\\" and \\"tools\\" to their place of work. These options are the most relevant to their profession, as they specialize in repairing and maintaining various types of machines, vehicles, and equipment. Machine parts include items such as spare parts, components, and consumables required for repairing or maintaining a vehicle or a piece of machinery. These may consist of engine parts, belts, filters, bearings, electrical components, and more. A mechanic needs these parts to replace worn or broken components and keep the machines in good working condition. Tools are essential for the mechanic to carry out diagnostic tests, repairs, and maintenance tasks efficiently. These include items like wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers, diagnostic tools, jacks, and other specialized tools needed in their day-to-day work. In some cases, a mechanic might also require or benefit from \\"machine tools,\\" which are devices or instruments used to shape, cut, or machine a raw material like metal into a desired shape or finished part. Examples include lathes, milling machines, and drill presses. However, not all mechanics use machine tools, as they may not be necessary depending on their specific job requirements. Although options like \\"oil machine with grease\\" and \\"oil engine\\" may seem relevant at first glance, these terms are less clear in meaning and application within the context of a mechanic's profession. \\"Oil machine with grease\\" might refer to machines that use or distribute lubricants, which could be useful in some circumstances, but it is not something a mechanic would typically order. As for \\"oil engine,\\" it might refer to an internal combustion engine that runs on oil.

However, it is important to consider that reduced logging activities alone would not fully address the issue of global warming, as burning fossil fuels remains a significant contributor to the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The following long answer aims to provide a more elaborate and inclusive response: The overall party strategy for a minority leader can be categorized into several key areas: 1. Coordinated Communications Strategy: As mentioned in the initial sentence, this strategy involves creating a unified and consistent message on key issues. This is important as it ensures that the leader and party members speak with one voice, thus reinforcing the party's stance and avoiding confusion. It may include the use of social media, press releases, public appearances, and other channels to disseminate the party's message effectively. 2. Policy Advocacies: The minority leader is responsible for presenting an alternative policy vision to that of the ruling party. This involves advocating for legislation that reflects the party's stated priorities and values. The minority leader must work closely with party members to draft policy proposals that can garner broad support not only within the party but also across the political spectrum. 3. Building and Maintaining Party Unity: The minority leader plays a significant role in maintaining party cohesion amidst varying and sometimes conflicting interests of its members. This entails acknowledging diverse viewpoints, settling disputes, and fostering internal communication channels, ultimately presenting a united front on key issues. 4. Liaising with other Opposition Parties: The minority leader's role also includes forging alliances and building consensus with other opposition parties. This is essential for galvanizing broader support and demonstrating a collaborative approach to challenge the ruling party. Strategic partnerships can strengthen the minority leader and opposition parties' position in debates, negotiations, and policy-making processes. 5. Public Engagement: The minority leader serves as the public face of the party, and hence, must effectively connect with the public and convey the party's vision and stance on crucial issues. This includes engaging with constituents, attending community events, speaking at public forums, and leveraging media outlets to further the party's message and increase visibility. Cultivating a strong public image is vital for the minority leader to maintain credibility and demonstrate leadership. 6. Holding the Ruling Party Accountable: The minority leader's main objective is to scrutinize the ruling party's decisions, policies, and actions, and drive accountability. This can be achieved by pushing for transparency, challenging controversial decisions, and advocating for investigations into malpractices or misuse of power. In conclusion, the overall party strategy for a minority leader encompasses a variety of interconnected approaches including a coordinated communications strategy, policy advocacies, party unity, liaison with other opposition parties, public engagement, and holding the ruling party accountable. These elements, when applied effectively, can strengthen the party's position and credibility, ultimately contributing to the overall political landscape."},{"question":"Anquetil was the son of a builder in Mont-Saint-Aignan, in the hills above Rouen in Normandy, north-west France. He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at Boisguillaume in a two-storey house, \\"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\\" In 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near Quincampoix. Anquetil's most humiliating race was the Trofeo Baracchi in Italy in 1962, when he had to be pushed by his partner, Rudi Altig, and was so exhausted that he hit a pillar before reaching the track on which the race finished. The Trofeo Baracchi was a 111 km race for two-man teams. Anquetil, the world's best time-triallist, and Altig, a powerful rider with a strong sprint, were favourites. But things soon went wrong. The writer Rene de Latour wrote: I got my stopwatch going again to check the length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check -- and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport -- something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front -- and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times. The pair reached the track on which the race finished. The timekeeper was at the entrance to the stadium, so Anquetil finished. But instead of turning on to the velodrome, he rode straight on and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds.

Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice.

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down.

Article: Below is a selection from a popular science book. If blood is red, why are veins blue? Actually, veins are not blue at all. They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison. Which works harder, your heart or your brain? This question depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much energy as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it. Do old people shrink as they age? Yes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity . Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3-4 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again?No, because old people don't really shrink!It is not that they are growing backwards--their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved. Why does spinning make you dizzy ? Because your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity and motion sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But when you suddenly stop spinning , the system goes out... Question: Why do some old people look a little shrunken as they age? Answer: Answer:","response":"Some old people look a little shrunken as they age because their spine becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity. This is not a shrinking all over, but rather a loss in height."},{"question":"Are the following two questions the same? Why is Bogota cold?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wood is in a desert climate happens, how will it affect more luster stays. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","response":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have a significant direct and indirect effect on the process. Given that the original process takes place in an environment where rainfall is consistent or substantial, changing the climatic condition to a desert environment will significantly reduce or possibly halt the facilitation of the process for the following reasons: 1. Direct effect: In desert climates, the rate of rainfall is significantly lower compared to other regions. The difference in the frequency of rainfalls and water availability would lead to less direct moisture and water impact on the wood. This would minimize or eliminate the seeping of water into the wood surface, therefore affecting the process from the onset. Furthermore, there would be less water permeating the wood, reducing any damage or alterations to the wood's composition and finish caused by the absorption and eventual evaporation of the rainwater. This could ultimately result in the finish and luster of the wood staying intact for a longer duration. 2. Indirect effect: By preserving the finish and luster of the wood, the process of the wood looking bad, having pieces of paint missing, and getting worse each time it rains, would be slowed down considerably or eliminated entirely due to the lack of rainfall. The durability of the paint may improve due to more stable conditions, thereby keeping the wood more aesthetically pleasing for a longer time. 3. Moreover, the reduced humidity typical in desert climates could also help to extend the paint's life by decreasing the likelihood of moisture-related issues, such as mold and mildew that are known to affect paint durability negatively. 4. However, increasing the wood's exposure to high temperatures and sunlight (which characterizes desert climates) can cause the finish to fade or crack over time - a new kind of weathering that was not part of the original process. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can deteriorate and break down the paint over time, leading to fading colors and slow degradation of the wood surface, potentially reducing its luster. In conclusion, the perturbation of moving the wood into a desert climate would lead to a considerable change in how the wood's luster is maintained. With less threat from rain, the wood's luster will last longer, although it will need to endure a different kind of weathering from the hard sunlight and heat usually experienced in a desert environment. To mitigate this, protective measures, such as UV-resistant finishing or paint, would be a beneficial adaptation to this new climate, contributing to maintaining the luster and appearance of the wood."},{"question":"How to beat anorexia<br>Seek emergency treatment if needed. Anorexia can cause severe, life-threatening health problems. If you are in need of urgent care, the absolute first thing you need to do is get to an emergency room. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Eating some hamburgers might help. Options: a). Yes; b). It's impossible to say; c). No;","response":"c). No; The sentence \\"Eating some hamburgers might help\\" does not follow appropriately after the emergency treatment instructions because of a few reasons and might inadvertently appear dismissive of the seriousness of anorexia. Anorexia is a serious mental health condition that usually requires professional help and support to cope with and recover from. The process of addressing anorexia is more comprehensive and multifaceted than just focusing on food consumption, especially in the form of hamburgers. Here are some suggestions for a more appropriate way to continue from the initial text: 1. Seek professional help: Speak with a mental health professional such as a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. They can help you understand the underlying causes of anorexia, develop healthier thoughts and patterns around food, and provide coping strategies for dealing with anxiety and triggers. 2. Establish a support system: Surround yourself with friends, family members, or support groups who can help you through the recovery process. A strong support system can provide encouragement, understanding, and accountability as you work on recovering from anorexia. 3. Create a meal plan: Develop a structured meal plan that meets your nutritional needs and is approved by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian specializing in eating disorder recovery. This plan should be realistic, feasible and support gradual improvements in eating habits. 4. Prioritize self-care: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being as you work toward recovery. This can include engaging in enjoyable activities, regular exercise (as recommended by your healthcare team), practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining healthy sleep habits. 5. Address co-occurring conditions: Anorexia often co-exists with other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and self-esteem concerns, which may contribute to the development or persistence of the disorder. Working with your mental health professional to address these co-occurring conditions can help improve your overall recovery. Remember that recovering from anorexia is a process, and it takes time, commitment, and ongoing support. It is crucial not to oversimplify the condition, as it requires a comprehensive approach to treatment and recovery."},{"question":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: GreatHDqualityanddownloadpornphotosandvideoswithcelebritiesfromletitbit","response":"Great HD quality and download porn photos and videos with celebrities from let it bit."},{"question":"There are 30 players on a football team.

Number 13 has always been considered unlucky , mainly as a result of it being associated with various occurrences in mythology . While some associate it with the instance of Norse mythology , in which the god of joy and gladness - Balter , was killed in a dishonest manner by Loki - the god of discord and mischief , who was the 13th guest , others associate it with the Last Supper , in which the 13th guest was Judas , who betrayed Jesus to his enemies for 30 pieces of silver . Similarly , Friday has also been a sign of bad luck to many people , with incidents like Jesus being crucified on this unfaithful day , contributing to this belief . It is also widely believed that Cain killed Able on this very day of the week . The fear of Friday the 13th is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia , the former combining the words frigga , meaning Friday , and triskaidekaphobia , meaning the phobia of number 13 .

Plot title: Miami Vice Movie plot: While working an undercover prostitute sting operation in a nightclub to arrest a pimp named Neptune, Miami-Dade Police detectives James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett and Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Tubbs receive a frantic phone call from their former informant Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes). Stevens reveals that he's leaving town, and, believing his wife Leonetta to be in immediate danger, asks Rico to check on her. Crockett learns that Stevens was working as an informant for the FBI but has been compromised. Crockett and Tubbs quickly contact FBI Special Agent in Charge John Fujima (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and warn him about Stevens' safety. Tracking down Stevens through a vehicle transponder and aerial surveillance, Crockett and Tubbs stop him along I-95. Stevens reveals that a Colombian cartel had become aware that Russian undercovers (now dead) were working with the FBI, and had threatened to murder Leonetta via a C-4 necklace bomb if he didn't confess. Rico, learning of Leonetta's death by telephone call, tells Alonzo that he doesn't have to go home. Hearing this, the grief-stricken Stevens commits suicide by walking in front of an oncoming semi truck. En route to the murder scene, Sonny and Rico receive a call from Lt. Castillo (Barry Shabaka Henley) and are instructed to stay away. He tells them to meet him downtown, where they are introduced in person to John Fujima, head of the Florida Joint Inter-Agency Task Force between the FBI, the DEA, and ICE. Crockett and Tubbs berate Fujima for the errors committed and inquire as to why the MPD wasn't involved. Fujima reveals that the Colombian group is highly sophisticated and run by JosÃ© Yero (John Ortiz), initially thought to be the cartel's leader. Fujima enlists Crockett and Tubbs, making them Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force deputies, to help, and they continue the investigation by looking into go-fast boats coming from the Caribbean, delivering loads of narcotics from the Colombians.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully.

With the 20th pick of the second round and the 51st pick overall in the NFL draft on Friday night, the Jets selected Penn State’s Christian Hackenberg, making him the 37th quarterback in a checkered team history that has not included many good ones at the most important position the field. Maybe the Jets were reaching for a little bit of mojo when they had Chad Pennington, one of the best quarterbacks in their history, announce the pick in Chicago. But, unless you believe Hackenberg will be ready to step in immediately as the starter — and you should not — the Jets now lead the league in backup quarterbacks on their roster. They have three of them, including two projects who are not yet ready for NFL prime time, and no starter. With 2015 starter Ryan Fitzpatrick still locked in a contract squabble with the Jets, Geno Smith, Bryce Petty and Hackenberg are the quarterbacks on their current roster. Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan called Hackenberg “a prospect we’re excited about,’’ adding, “We think he has lot of potential and upside.’’ The drafting of Hackenberg does not affect the Fitzpatrick situation. The Jets still want him back. They need him. But he needs them, too, because no team is knocking down his door with a 15 million offer to have him start in 2016. But the drafting of Hackenberg is a damning indictment of both Smith, their second-round pick in 2013, and Petty, whom they drafted in the fourth round last year. It’s not fair and too soon to rip this move, because the potential for Hackenberg is obvious based on his physical skills and the fact he has played three years at a big-time program. But this is the first controversial move of the Maccagnan era, with most of the maneuvers he has made to date somewhat conventional and conservative by comparison. This one raises eyebrows in that a valuable second-round pick was spent on a player who has little to no chance of helping the team in 2016. Speaking to reporters on a conference call shortly after the pick, Hackenberg sounded humbled at being chosen after his well-documented struggles of the last two seasons in Happy Valley. “It’s a new opportunity and a new environment,’’ Hackenberg said in what was probably the most telling statement he made, referring to finally extricating himself from the negative atmosphere Penn State had become in his final two seasons, which included NCAA sanctions and a head coaching change. “I’m super grateful.’’ Jets fans will be the grateful ones if Hackenberg works out eventually, because no team has had more instability at the quarterback position across its history than the Jets. Hackenberg is the 11th quarterback the Jets have drafted since 2000 and the ninth in the past 10 years. The Jets have had 11 different starting quarterbacks since 2000. Other than Mark Sanchez (2009-2012), none has held the job for more than two consecutive seasons. Hackenberg comes to the Jets as damaged goods of sorts — psychologically damaged. Based on his declining numbers in his three seasons at Penn State, negativity and questions persisted. In three years at Penn State, Hackenberg’s completion percentage worsened each season with his 53.5 percent last season the lowest of his career, raising questions about his accuracy. He, too, was sacked 82 times over the last two seasons, raising questions about his mobility. His best year was as a freshman in 2013, when he threw for 2,995 yards with 20 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. “He needs to be rebuilt,” ESPN analyst Todd McShay said on a recent conference call. “He’s just got to regain his confidence,’’ former NFL coach and current ESPN analyst Jon Gruden said before the draft. “I’m just really looking forward to getting better with this opportunity,” Hackenberg said. “A lot of hours have gone into this. This is just the beginning.” Hopefully it is not the beginning of the end of yet another failed attempt by the Jets searching for that elusive franchise quarterback.","response":"The New York Jets are on the hunt for their 37th quarterback. With some interesting maneuvering at the NFL draft on Friday, they selected Christian Hackenberg from Penn State as the 51st pick overall. The general manager, Mike Maccagnan, called Hackenberg “a prospect we’re excited about”, hoping that he will become a good addition to a team that already has several quarterbacks on the roster. This selection, however, doesn't mean they're giving up on their 2015 starter, Ryan Fitzpatrick, who is currently in a contract dispute with the team. This recruit indicates the team’s lack of confidence in their current lineup. It’s hoped that Christian, with his promising physical skills, will help bring some stability to a team that has had quite a fluctuating history in terms of quarterbacks. To explain this story for a little one: The New York Jets are a football team who are looking for a really great player to throw the ball, a person called the quarterback. They have decided to choose a new player called Christian Hackenberg who they hope will be really good at this job. They have lots of other quarterbacks as well, but they hope this new little guy can be really great, even better than the rest. For now, they still want their old player, Ryan Fitzpatrick, to come back, but they are very excited about their new player, Christian."},{"question":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow and 330 acres of marsh?, using the article: The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre. The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","response":"Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln.

The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, and I am pleased to provide a comprehensive review that considers both the negative and positive aspects of the film. a) Negative Sentiment: Despite the film's noticeable strengths, there are elements that dampen the overall experience. One of the setbacks lies in the pacing of the story, which could have been more finely tuned. The editing appears disoriented in certain scenes, creating a jarring experience for the audience and momentarily disrupting the natural flow of events. Moreover, the subplot involving the protagonist's pursuit of love, while emotional and well-acted, detracts from the central theme and occasionally feels forced. The lack of strong character development in the supporting cast contributes to this distraction and occasionally makes it challenging to invest in their backstories. b) Positive Sentiment: On a brighter note, \\"A Tale of Two Worlds\\" shines in various aspects that cannot be overlooked. The film excels in delivering a powerful message by exploring the stark contrast between the two interconnected worlds and expertly elaborates on the themes of inequality, resilience, and hope that bridge human experiences across disparate societies. The cinematography in the movie is simply breathtaking. Several sequences of stunning visuals propel the narrative forward, making it a visual treat for the eyes and amplifying the emotions portrayed by the characters. Exceptional performances by the lead actors add to this masterpiece, allowing the audience to feel the depth of their struggles and their eventual triumph. A beautifully crafted soundtrack further enhances the emotional impact of the film, imbuing each scene with subtle power and grace. In summary, the movie \\"A Tale of Two Worlds\\" may falter in certain aspects, such as pacing and subplot, but it more than compensates with its thought-provoking themes, visually stunning cinematography, and excellent performances. It is a film that is worthy of the praise it has received and is likely to leave its audience contemplating long after the credits roll."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: \\"Tryin' to Hide a Fire in the Dark\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Billy Dean.

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian archaeologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology, he later became the first exponent of Marxist archaeology in the Western world. Born in Sydney to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied classics at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study classical archaeology at the University of Oxford. There, he embraced the socialist movement and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Labor Party as the private secretary of the politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture—the idea that a recurring assemblage of artefacts demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Ask three people to look out the same window at a busy street comer and tell you what they see. Chances are you will receive three different answers. Each person sees the same scene, but each perceives something different about it. Perceiving goes on in our minds. Of the three people who look out the window, one may say that he sees a policeman giving a motorist a ticket. Another may say that he sees a rush-hour traffic jam at the intersection. The third may tell you that he sees a woman trying to cross the street with four children in tow. For perception is the minds' interpretation of what the senses -- in this case our eyes -- tell us. Many psychologists today are working to try to determine just how a person experiences or perceives the world around him. Using a scientific approach, these psychologists set up experiments in which they can control all of the factors. By measuring and charting the results of many experiments, they are trying to find out what makes different people perceive totally different things about the same scene. Answer: in every person's mind Student:","response":"Teacher: To create the fill-in-the-blank question, first identify the main point of the article and the answer provided. In this case, the main point is that perception varies among people and it's a process that occurs \\"in every person's mind.\\" Based on the article and answer, you can create a question like this: \\"Perception, which can make different people see distinct aspects of the same scene, occurs _____________ ____ ____________ ___________.\\" Now, the blank spaces can be filled with \\"in every person's mind\\" to complete the question."},{"question":"Translate from English to Spanish: Pamplona most well known attraction is the Festivity of San Fermín, this festivity is based on the running of the bulls .","response":"To translate the given sentence from English to Spanish, I will first identify the main components of the sentence, then find the appropriate Spanish translations for each component, and finally construct the sentence in Spanish while maintaining the proper grammar and sentence structure.

Festivity of San Fermín (proper noun) - Fiesta de San Fermín 4. this festivity (pronoun) - esta festividad 5. based on (prepositional phrase) - basada en 6. the running of the bulls (noun phrase) - el encierro de toros Finally, I will construct the sentence in Spanish: \\"La atracción más conocida de Pamplona es la Fiesta de San Fermín, esta festividad está basada en el encierro de toros.\\" Step by step, the translated sentence is constructed as: - \\"La\\" is the definite article for the feminine noun \\"atracción.\\" - \\"atracción más conocida\\" is the noun phrase for \\"most well-known attraction.\\" - \\"de Pamplona\\" is the proper noun for \\"Pamplona.\\" - \\"es\\" is the verb \\"to be\\" (ser) in its conjugated form for the subject \\"La atracción.\\" - \\"la Fiesta de San Fermín\\" is the proper noun for \\"Festivity of San Fermín.\\" - \\"esta festividad\\" is the pronoun for \\"this festivity,\\" agreeing in gender with the feminine noun \\"Fiesta.\\" - \\"está basada\\" is the verb \\"to be\\" (estar) in its conjugated form for the subject \\"Festividad,\\" followed by the past participle \\"based.\\" This construction emphasizes the condition or state of being based on something. - \\"en\\" is the preposition for \\"based on.\\" - \\"el encierro de toros\\" is the noun phrase for \\"the running of bulls.\\" By putting all the components together, I arrive at the Spanish translation of the given sentence: \\"La atracción más conocida de Pamplona es la Fiesta de San Fermín, esta festividad está basada en el encierro de toros.\\""},{"question":"Here is an article: This transcript is automatically generated MARTHA: SO ALL OF THIS RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IN SELLING HIS PLAN, BECAUSE JUST YESTERDAY HE SAID THAT IT'S NOT JUST HIS REPUTATION AND HIS CREDIBILITY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE. >> MY CREDIBILITY'S NOT ON THE LINE. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S CREDIBILITY IS ON THE LINE. AND AMERICA AND CONGRESS' CREDIBILITY'S ON THE LINE BECAUSE WE GIVE LIP SERVICE TO THE NOTION THAT THESE INTERNATIONAL NORMS ARE IMPORTANT. MARTHA: THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THE RED LINE WAS CROSSED, THERE WOULD BE ACTION. THEN HE SAID THE RED LINE WAS CROSSED X HE BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ACT IN THIS CASE, AND I'M JOINED NOW BY ILLINOIS GOP CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER WHO'S A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND WAS IN THAT HEARING YESTERDAY.

HOW IS IT FEELING RIGHT NOW IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES? >> LOOK, IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD RIGHT NOW FOR THIS THING TO PASS. AS YOU KNOW, I SUPPORT IT, I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AMERICA HAS PUT DOWN A RED LINE FOR THREE DECADES WHETHER IT'S THE GULF WAR, WHETHER IT WAS THE NO-FLY ZONES IN IRAQ. BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS ON THIS, I DON'T SEE A LEVEL OF REAL PASSION TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

SO, LOOK, WHILE I AGREE THAT THE STRIKE NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE BASHAR al ASSAD NEEDS TO SEE THAT THE COSTS OF USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXCEEDS THE BENEFITS OF USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS, THE PRESIDENT'S GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SELLING THIS. SECRETARY KERRY'S DOING A GREAT JOB OF TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE INTEREST IS, BUT HE'S A SECRETARY OF STATE. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS GOT TO BE THE PERSON.

LOOK, I WISH HIM LUCK AT THE G20 SUMMIT, I HOPE HE CAN BRING MORE FOLKS ONBOARD, BUT THE REALITY IS IS THIS, ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THE UNITED NATIONS, RUSSIA'S GOING TO SHUT DOWN. AND THE REASON OUR ALLIES AREN'T FOLLOWING US IS BECAUSE OUR ALLIES LOOK FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND FOLLOW IT. THEY DON'T SEE LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW, SO WHAT DO THEY HAVE INVESTED IN THIS TO BACK US? I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TO BE A SALESMAN FOR WHAT AMERICAN POWER AND STRENGTH AROUND THE GLOBE MEANS.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YEAH, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE REBELS -- PROBABLY 15-20% OF THEM WAS THE LATEST ESTIMATE I HEARD -- ARE ACTUALLY EXTREMISTS. BUT THAT MEANS A HUGE MAJORITY ARE MODERATES AND PEOPLE THAT REALLY WANT A SECULAR GOVERNMENT. THIS IS WHY TWO YEARS AGO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NEEDED TO COME OUT AND HAVE CIA VETTING OPPOSITION GROUPS FOR THOSE THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF AMERICAN CAUSES AND WANT TO GET RID OF BASHAR al ASSAD WITH A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, AND HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. HE PUT THIS RED LINE OUT A YEAR AGO. I DIDN'T WANT HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT THEN, BY THE WAY. BUT HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY ABSENT IN TERMS OF SUPPLYING THE REBELS. ARE THERE BAD FACTIONS IN SYRIA? YES. IS THERE ANY GOOD OUTCOME TO SYRIA? NOT REALLY AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN ABSENT IN LEADERSHIP. MARTHA: YOU RAISE A GREAT POINT AND SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT, DID WE MISS OUR MOMENT IN SYRIA? AND IF YOU DO MISS YOUR MOMENT, CAN YOU GET IT BACK, AND IS IT MORE DANGEROUS TO ACT THAN NOT TO ACT? >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE MISSED OUR MOMENT.

AMERICANS HAVE NEVER FACED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THE BATTLEFIELD SINCE WORLD WAR I BECAUSE WE'VE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE DO NOT TOLERATE. SO IF ASSAD HAS GOT TO KNOW THAT ANY USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS WILL BE MET WITH A COST THAT FAR EXCEEDS ANYTHING HE CAN GAIN BY USING THEM. MARTHA: CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

Harold's partner","response":"Title: \\"Finding Victoria\\" Genre: Action, Thriller, Mystery Plot: Act 1: Harold White, an ex-military intelligence officer, now working as a private detective in his late 40s, receives a mysterious letter from an unknown source. The letter contains a simple question, \\"Who is Victoria?\\". Haunted by the past, Harold is intrigued, as he believes the sender is referring to the memory of his late partner, Victoria Goldstein, who tragically died during a failed undercover mission ten years ago. Knowing there must be more to the story, Harold starts investigating the mysterious note. His first lead takes him to a classified military file with new information surrounding the mission. The file reveals that there was a third person involved in the mission, who somehow managed to stay under the radar until now. Additionally, there are rumors that Victoria might still be alive, but in grave danger. Act 2: Motivated by the possibility of Victoria's survival, Harold tracks down a former military informant named \\"Nemesis\\" known for his connections to various criminal organizations. After a dangerous encounter with Nemesis, Harold finds out that Victoria is actually alive and is being held in a remote location known as the \\"The Sanctuary\\" controlled by a criminal mastermind named Arthur Vasiliev. Arthur, a dangerous and influential figure, is known for his illegal human experimentations and is using Victoria for her intelligence expertise to gain access to top-secret military information. Further investigating drives Harold to discover that Arthur is planning an attack at a great scale. Reaching out to his last remaining allies to help break Victoria out of The Sanctuary, Harold and his team manage to pull off an intricate and action-packed rescue mission, with tense shootouts and narrow escapes. Finally, Harold is reunited with Victoria, but a betrayal from within reveals that one of their team members is a mole working for Vasiliev. Act 3: Struggling to deal with the betrayal, Victoria and Harold work together to stop Vasiliev's evil plans. Utilizing their combined intelligence and skills, the duo infiltrates Vasiliev's organization, acquiring the details about Arthur's plan to commit a major terrorist attack. As the clock ticks down, Victoria and Harold engage in heated gunfights and covert operations to stop the attack. They manage to reach Arthur at the critical moment, narrowly averting the tragedy and apprehending him. In the aftermath, Victoria and Harold grapple with the wounds that their pasts have caused them. Despite their time apart, they both recognize that their deep bond has never faded. The two decide to continue working together, forming a formidable detective partnership to make the world a safer place. In the final scene, Harold receives another mysterious letter, this time reading, \\"Who is Nemesis?\\". The movie ends on a cliffhanger with Harold and Victoria ready to embark on their next adventure."},{"question":"The release of its report led to calls for a complete ivory trade ban, and at the seventh conference in 1989, the African Elephant was moved to appendix one of the treaty.

The initial text states that Jamiel Shaw II was shot by two Hispanic men while returning home from the Beverly Center. However, it does not mention whether a verbal communication took place or if it escalated, leading to Shaw's murder. To confirm the validity of this subsequent sentence, more information is needed, such as eyewitness accounts or police reports regarding the incident. The murder of Jamiel Shaw II on March 2, 2008, in Arlington Heights, Los Angeles, California, has garnered significant attention due to its tragic nature. Shaw, a 17-year-old Los Angeles High School football player, was fatally shot by two Hispanic men while on his way home from the Beverly Center. He was transported to a hospital, where, unfortunately, he later succumbed to his injuries. To better understand the context of the murder, it's essential to examine the events leading up to it. On the evening of March 2, Shaw had been shopping at the Beverly Center and was walking back to his home in Arlington Heights. As he approached his destination, he encountered two Hispanic men. Although the provided information does not specify whether any altercation or verbal communication occurred between Shaw and the two men, it is stated that the situation culminated in Shaw's murder. Following the shooting, Shaw was rushed to a nearby hospital, but despite the efforts of medical professionals, he did not survive his injuries. The tragic event left his family, friends, and the community searching for answers and justice for the young football player. In response to the murder, law enforcement launched an investigation into the incident. Detectives worked to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and piece together the chain of events that led up to Shaw's senseless murder. From these efforts, they were able to identify the two Hispanic men responsible for the shooting.

The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic. Which groups atom's poles would align in more orderly fashion, group A or group B? Hint: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. The answer is:","response":"Group A"},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In the second act of Tosca, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually... answer the following question: What is the name of the aria Puccini considered eliminating because it held up the action?

However, Sam struggles to connect with his workaholic nature and family responsibilities, feeling an ever-growing divide within himself. One day, Sam takes on a high-profile case involving the potential wrongful conviction of a man named Henry Matthews. Henry, a kind-hearted blue-collar worker, has been accused of a hit-and-run that resulted in the death of a young woman named Emily Davis. Henry's defense relies heavily on testimonies and circumstantial evidence, as security cameras could not capture the crime.

As Sam is starting to connect the dots, he starts receiving anonymous threats, warning him to back off or risk consequences for him and his family. Emma, fearing that Sam's work is now putting their family in jeopardy, demands that he drop the case. Torn between his dedication to justice and his love for his family, Sam decides to pursue the case in secret. Act Three: The Climax Sam, working tirelessly, follows the trail of evidence leading him to a prominent businessman and city council member, Richard Hughes. Sam struggles to gather enough solid evidence, as Richard has presented a benevolent public image and maintains strong ties to the community. However, with the help of a trusted colleague and an investigative journalist, Sam discovers the morbid truth: Richard was behind Emily's murder and framed Henry to protect both his image and shady business dealings. With the help of his allies, Sam takes the evidence to court, exposing the truth about Richard to the public. Despite the high stakes and numerous setbacks, Sam finally wins the case, exonerating Henry and ensuring that Richard pays for his crimes. Act Four: Resolution The movie ends with Sam reuniting with his family, his love for them strengthened by adversity.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the possibility of traveling faster than the speed of light, we have to take into account Einstein's theory of relativity. According to this theory, as an object's velocity approaches the speed of light, its mass increases, which means it would require more and more energy to continue accelerating. Consequently, if an object were to truly reach the speed of light, it would require infinite energy, making it impossible to surpass this barrier. Additionally, there are certain time and space distortions that occur when approaching the speed of light, leading to theoretical time dilation and length contraction which cause further complications in breaking this barrier. While there have been some hypothetical particles called tachyons that are believed to travel faster than light, their existence has never been confirmed. So, taking these factors into consideration, can we travel faster than the speed of light? Answer: No."},{"question":"What most naturally follows? How to stay in shape Establish your goals.

The Christians set it afire before abandoning it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession on 5 May 1109. The event was commemorated in a poem by Ibn Khafaja in which he thanked Yusuf ibn Tashfin for the city's liberation.The declining power of the Almoravids coincided with the rise of a new dynasty in North Africa, the Almohads, who seized control of the peninsula from the year 1145, although their entry into Valencia was deterred by Ibn Mardanis, King of Valencia and Murcia until 1171, at which time the city finally fell to the North Africans.

Answer: While the statement \\"It cannot be a group of women and a man simultaneously\\" seems to refer to different genders being physically present in the same individual, it is important to note that gender identity and expression can be more fluid and complex than binary male or female categories. Some individuals identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or genderfluid, meaning their gender identity may not be strictly tied to the traditional categories of man and woman. In such cases, a person might experience changes in their self-perception and expression of gender, sometimes identifying as a man, a woman, both, or neither at different times. Therefore, the concept of gender is not always limited to strictly male or female classifications, and there is a diversity of gender experiences and expressions that can exist outside of the binary spectrum."},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -21*b - 1230 - 2488 = -164*b for b.","response":"Let's solve the given equation for b: -21*b - 1230 - 2488 = -164*b First, simplify the left side of the equation by combining the constant terms: -21*b - 3718 = -164*b Now, to solve for b, we need to isolate the variable b on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 164*b to both sides of the equation: -21*b + 164*b - 3718 = -164*b + 164*b This simplifies to: 143*b - 3718 = 0 Now, add 3718 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with b: 143*b = 3718 Finally, divide both sides by 143 to find the value of b: b = 3718 / 143 b ≈ 25.993 Therefore, b is approximately 25.993."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Let's solve step-by-step:","response":"To answer this question, let's first analyze both statements to determine if there is a direct connection or correlation between the two. Statement 1: \\"A man trying to jump into a floaty in beautiful water.\\" This statement describes a man attempting to jump onto a floatation device, likely in a swimming pool, lake, or ocean. This suggests a possible recreational activity occurring in a water-based environment. Statement 2: \\"A man pitches a tent in an isolated desert environment.\\" This statement describes a man setting up a tent in a remote desert location, likely for camping or exploration purposes. This suggests an outdoor activity happening in an arid, land-based environment. Now, let's examine the options for whether these two statements are equivalent: Option 1: Yes It might seem tempting to assume that both statements refer to a person engaging in outdoor activities, but the two activities and environments differ significantly. One is based around water and leisure, while the other is set in a desert environment and may involve exploration or camping.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: ; Power in electricity is the voltage multiplied by the current. Choices: - power - wattage - amperes - the current A: Answer:","response":"The current Explanation: Power in electricity is a measure of the rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electrical circuit. This concept can be understood using the power law in electricity, which defines that the power (P) in an electrical circuit is equivalent to the product of voltage (V), which is the potential difference, and current (I), which is the rate of flow of electric charge. This relationship is expressed mathematically as P = V x I. In the paragraph provided, it is stated, \\"Power in electricity is the voltage multiplied by the current.\\". This statement implies that the product of voltage and current is what determines the power in an electric circuit. Therefore, if we consider the provided range of options, we see that 'the current' aligns with the context of the statement given. Let's go through the other choices and understand why they cannot be the correct answer: 1. Power - It's the result of the multiplication of voltage and current, not one of the multiple. 2. Wattage - It is a measure of power, not a factor in the multiplication. 3. Amperes - Though 'Amperes' is the unit of electric current and technically correct, an option provided specifically mentions 'the current'. It's more appropriate to select 'the current' as the answer in the specific context of the question, as it precisely explains the relationship between power, voltage, and current.

Plot title: The Fifth Element Movie plot: In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for safekeeping, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000 years. The weapon consists of four stones, representing the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the element stones in time to stop the great evil when it returns. In 2263,[b] the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), informs the President of the Federated Territories (Tom Lister Jr.) of the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), who has been instructed by the great evil to acquire the stones. The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, though the stones are not on board; the only item recovered is a hand of The Fifth Element. Scientists take it to a New York City laboratory and use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a former major in the special forces. Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David (Charlie Creed-Miles), whereupon Cornelius learns that the Mondoshawans entrusted the four element stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna (MaÃ¯wenn Le Besco), an opera singer.

But it wasn't an ordinary bike. As he pedaled, the President stayed in place, while the energy from his pedaling powered a water filtration system. He was testing an invention created by a team of 14 students from Northeast High School, in Oakland Park, Florida. Payton Karr, 16, and Kiona Elliot, 18, attended the fair as representatives of the project.\\"We were hoping President Obama would ride the bike, but we didn't actually expect him to,\\" Payton told TFK. \\" It really meant a lot.\\" Kiona agreed. \\"It was pretty awesome to see the invention, which was invented by a group of 14 high school students and one teacher, along with the help of community members, got the interest of the leader of our nation,\\" she said. The project was an idea that came about after one of the Northeast students, Kalie Hoke, visited Haiti after the terrible 2010 earthquake and saw how difficult it was to find clean water. The students invented a portable , bicycle-powered emergency water filtration system, which can provide 20-30 people with drinking water in a 15-hour period. The teens hope their invention will one day be used by relief organizations like the Red Cross. \\" They can take it to places after natural disasters so that water can be clean for the people there,\\" said Payton. Payton and Kiona were among the 100 students from more than 40 states invited to the third annual White House Science Fair, in Washington, D.C., which is also attended by leaders in science and education.

Options: - art show - classroom - labyrinth - corner - paint store Reasoning process:","response":"To find inspiration for original paintings to put on your wall, let's consider the options: 1. Art show: Art shows typically display a variety of original artwork from different artists, which can provide you with a source of inspiration and potentially give you an opportunity to buy a suitable painting. This seems like a logical choice for your purpose. 2. Classroom: Depending on the type of classroom, you may or may not find inspiration here. For example, an art classroom might have examples of student work that could inspire you, but a math classroom probably wouldn't provide the same level of inspiration. It's a possibility, but not as reliable as an art show. 3. Labyrinth: A labyrinth is a confusing and complicated maze-like structure. While it might provide inspiration for certain creative work, it's unlikely to directly help you find original paintings to put on your wall. This option is not recommended. 4. Corner: A corner is an ambiguous term in this context and isn't likely to be a good source of inspiration for original paintings. It could mean a street corner, a room corner, or a metaphorical corner. Either way, this option doesn't seem promising for your purpose. 5. Paint store: While a paint store might provide you with materials to create your own artwork, it is not typically a place to find original paintings to buy or gain inspiration from other artists' work. Based on the reasoning above, the most suitable option for finding original paintings to put on your wall and seeking inspiration would be an art show."},{"question":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Fitzbillies eatType coffee shop; Fitzbillies food Indian; Fitzbillies priceRange more than £30; Fitzbillies customer rating high; Fitzbillies area riverside","response":"Fitzbillies is a type of coffee shop where you can eat yummy Indian food by the beautiful riverside, but it can cost more than £30, and lots of people love it because it has a high customer rating."},{"question":"What is the subject line for this email? Ken, As you'll recall, during the September 10th advisory board meeting, we discussed the need for strong, senior-level support to ensure an opportunity for Xcelerator's success. At the conclusion of the meeting, we agreed you and Greg Whalley would discuss the support level with the Management Committee on the 13th. Of course, the sad events of the 11th understandably delayed that timeline. Since September 10th, I've revisited the Xcelerator with several members of the Management Committee including Louise Kitchen, John Lovorato, Jim Fallon, John Sheriff, and Andy Fastow. In summary, they are supportive contingent on support from you and Greg. Additionally, other Xcelerator board members are supportive - specifically Jeff Donahue and Kevin Garland - but all agree the sincere support from you and Greg will be necessary for success. Greg Whalley and I have also discussed the Xcelerator on two occasions. Greg is concerned that I will be unable to attract good talent from within Enron to this \\"risky\\" initiative, especially given the trajectory of the economy and scarcity of new jobs within the company. I agree with him. Greg asked if I would try the Xcelerator understanding that most if not all of the full-time team members would need to be hired from the outside. Although not optimal, I think it is doable and told him I'd be willing to proceed under those circumstances. While Greg was quite supportive, he was appropriately distracted by the upcoming board meeting and close of the quarter. As a result, he and I are planning on discussing the future of the Xcelerator this Tuesday. (Of course, the earnings announcement may delay that discussion to next week.) As I mentioned in the Xcelerator's board meeting, I am excited about this opportunity and am committed to giving it my all, with the support of the senior team. This effort could create tremendous value for Enron. However, I have no delusions about how difficult it will be and the patience it will require. If we are successful over '02, we will definitely create value for our shareholders, but are almost certain to be a drag on earnings -- albeit a small one. If you and Greg are not able to be supportive, then let's acknowledge that and discontinue the Xcelerator's operations. As we discussed on the 10th, lukewarm senior support will not be sufficient for success.","response":"Subject: Seeking Confirmation on Senior-Level Support for Xcelerator Initiative"},{"question":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: who uses her confidence with the king to steal back the key ? Movie title: The Court Jester Movie plot: Set in medieval England, the plot concerns the struggle to restore to the throne the rightful heir, a baby with a distinguishing birthmark, the purple pimpernel on his posterior. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, an ex-carnival entertainer who becomes minstrel to the Black Fox, a Robin Hood-type character who leads a band of rebels in the forest in support of the true infant-king. The usurping King Roderick (Cecil Parker) wishes his daughter, Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), to marry his neighbour, Sir Griswold of MacElwain (Robert Middleton), and to enlist Griswold's aid against the band of forest rebels. Princess Gwendolyn refuses, since she dreams of a more handsome, gallant lover, and her personal maid Griselda (Mildred Natwick), who is a witch, has predicted that her true love will arrive at the castle to court her. The Griswold marriage plan also displeases Lord Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), who fears that Griswold's presence may cost him his privileged position with the king. The Black Fox orders Hawkins to carry the infant-king across the country to safety, accompanied by his captain, the maid Jean. On the journey, a romance blossoms between Hawkins and Jean. They encounter the King's new jester, \\"Giacomo, 'King of Jesters and Jester of Kings'\\" (John Carradine) on his way to the castle. They knock him out and Hawkins impersonates him, hoping to gain entry to the King's castle. He is assigned to steal the key to a secret passage into the castle, through which the Black Fox could then attack. However, Hawkins is unaware that the jester he is impersonating is also a famous assassin whom Lord Ravenhurst plans to employ to murder his rivals at court: Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee. Upon Hawkins' arrival, Griselda hypnotizes him and changes his personality for that of a gallant, dashing lover, who sneaks into the Princess Gwendolyn's chambers and wins her affections, though he rapidly switches in and out of this personality whenever anyone (including himself) snaps their fingers. Maid Jean is captured... A:","response":"In the movie \\"The Court Jester,\\" it is Maid Jean (played by Glynis Johns) who uses her confidence with the king to steal back the key. Jean, who initially accompanies Hubert Hawkins (played by Danny Kaye) on his mission to carry the infant-king to safety, plays a crucial role in the plot. As Hawkins impersonates the King's new jester, Giacomo, to gain entry into the castle, he is caught in a web of deception and intrigue, being mistaken for a skilled assassin, whom Lord Ravenhurst (played by Basil Rathbone) intends to use to eliminate his rivals. At the same time, Griselda (played by Mildred Natwick) hypnotizes Hawkins, causing his personality to switch back and forth between his regular self and a dashing lover whenever someone snaps their fingers. While navigating the complexities of the castle, Jean manages to blend in as one of the servants and creates a strong bond with King Roderick (played by Cecil Parker), who has no idea of her alliance with the Black Fox and the infant-king. This bond and her skills as a persuasive and resourceful woman allow her to gain the king's trust and confidence. As the story unfolds, Jean sees an opportunity to steal the key to the secret passage, which would allow the Black Fox to launch an attack and reclaim the throne for the rightful heir. Jean's success in stealing the key is a testament to her intelligence and her ability to adapt to the situation. As she and Hawkins face the various obstacles inside the castle, they maintain their loyalties to each other and to the mission of restoring the true infant-king to the throne. In conclusion, Maid Jean is the one who uses her confidence with the king to steal back the key, which ultimately enables the Black Fox and his band of rebels to infiltrate the castle and overthrow the usurper, King Roderick. The film highlights the importance of teamwork, cunning, and loyalty, while also providing a humorous and engaging exploration of medieval court life."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The game took place on December 6, 2008, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The participating teams were winners of their respective divisions within the Big 12 Conference: Oklahoma Sooners representing the South Division and Missouri Tigers representing the North Division. Under the guidance of head coach Bob Stoops, the Oklahoma Sooners entered the game as the #2 ranked team nationally with an impressive 11-1 overall record. The Missouri Tigers, coached by Gary Pinkel, came into the game with a 9-3 overall record and ranked #19 nationally. The game featured a high-powered Oklahoma offense led by quarterback Sam Bradford, who would go on to win the Heisman Trophy that year. The Sooners' offense, which consisted of wide receivers Juaquin Iglesias and Ryan Broyles, tight end Jermaine Gresham, and running back DeMarco Murray, lived up to its reputation by putting up 62 points in a highly dominant game. On the other hand, Missouri's quarterback, Chase Daniel, and star receiver, Jeremy Maclin, failed to keep up with the Sooner's offensive onslaught. The final score of the game was a lopsided 62-21 victory for the Oklahoma Sooners, earning them the Big 12 Championship title for the third straight year and their sixth overall title since the conference's formation in 1996.

Options: - compliments - more leisure time - not feel pain - make money - successful in life Explain why a human would choose \\"not feel pain\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human might choose \\"not feel pain\\" as the reason for taking drugs due to several factors. These factors can range from physical and emotional pain relief, coping with stress and interpersonal issues, and lessening the burden caused by chronic illnesses or injuries. Let us dissect the motivations that lead an individual to take drugs to not feel pain in a more detailed manner. 1. Physical Pain Relief: One of the most fundamental reasons people take drugs is to alleviate physical pain. This pain could stem from an injury or resulting from a medical or surgical procedure. In these cases, drugs may be prescribed by medical professionals to help patients manage pain effectively. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, are common for minor aches and pains. On the other hand, prescription opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine may be suggested for moderate to severe pain relief. While these medications can be helpful in managing pain, there also exists the potential for misuse, leading to addiction in some individuals. 2. Chronic Illness or Injury: Millions of people around the world suffer from chronic illnesses or long-term injuries that cause them to experience pain daily. Conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathy are just a few examples of situations where individuals may feel persistent pain. In such cases, drugs might be taken to help manage this pain and somewhat improve the quality of life for these individuals. 3. Emotional Pain Relief: Emotional pain can be as debilitating as physical pain, and some people may turn to drugs as a way to numb their feelings or escape reality. For instance, individuals facing mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might use drugs as a coping mechanism in order to feel temporary relief from their emotional distress. This use of drugs to self-medicate is a possible precursor to addiction and dependence. 4. Coping with Stress and Interpersonal Issues: Life is inherently full of both major and minor stressors. These stressors can be compounded with interpersonal problems, such as issues within familial or romantic relationships, challenges at work, or social pressures. As a result, some individuals might take drugs as a way to briefly escape from or manage these pressures, thus alleviating any associated pain or emotional discomfort. 5. Peer Pressure and Social Acceptance: In some cases, a person might take drugs in an attempt to fit in with a particular group or gain social acceptance. This drive to belong is an innate human desire, and while it is not specifically related to pain relief, it can be motivated by the fear of rejection, exclusion, or loneliness—all of which are uncomfortable emotional experiences. In conclusion, the choice to take drugs to not feel pain is multifaceted and complex, with roots in both physical and emotional well-being. While some individuals may rely on drugs for legitimate medical reasons related to pain management, others may misuse drugs in an attempt to find relief from emotional distress, manage stress, or seek social acceptance. It is essential to understand these motivations and provide support and resources to those in need to prevent addiction and promote overall well-being."},{"question":"Summarize this article in one sentence. The debate over net neutrality, the principle that all traffic on the network be treated equally, has intensified in recent days. President Obama has said this week that he wants the FCC to impose strong rules to protect net neutrality. Service providers said they would fight moves to impose stricter regulation. FCC press secretary Kim Hart confirmed to the BBC that the decision on the issue will be put off until the new year. \\"There will be no vote on open internet rules in the December meeting agenda. That would mean rules would now be finalised in 2015.\\" Earlier the FCC had said that it would make a decision by the end of the year. The debate hinges on whether service providers should be allowed to charge some net firms in order to prioritise their traffic on the network. Internet service providers (ISPs) argue they should be allowed to charge more for data-heavy services such as Netflix but net advocates say that doing so would undermine the principles of a free and equal internet for all. Many ISPs were stunned when President Obama made a statement urging the FCC to reclassify them so that they could be regulated more like other utilities. \\"Net neutrality has been built into the fabric of the internet since its creation,\\" the president said. \\"We cannot allow ISPs to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas.\\" The FCC has received four million public comments urging the same. In response, the telecommunications industry said that it would lobby the FCC not to go down that route and is willing to go to court if that does not work. \\"We are stunned the president would abandon the long-standing bipartisan policy of lightly regulating the internet,\\" said National Cable and Telecommunication Association president Michael Powell. The new rules are yet to be written but the FCC has hinted that it is paving the way to allow some traffic to be prioritised. FCC head Tom Wheeler is seen as keen to pacify huge internet providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon. The Washington Post reported that he told a group of internet firms that he favoured a more \\"nuanced\\" solution than the one proposed by President Obama. The need for the new rules came about following a legal challenge from Verizon which the court ultimately agreed with. While the court did not disagree with the need to protect net neutrality, it questioned the FCC's legal approach.","response":"The debate over net neutrality intensifies as President Obama calls for strong FCC rules, service providers oppose stricter regulations, and the FCC's decision is postponed until 2015."},{"question":"Given the question: What key details about peter cartwright -lrb- footballer -rrb- can be extracted from the following bio?

When a penguin wants to walk through its neighbor's ground, it must ask for permission . If it does not, it will have to fight. Penguins come and go all day. They fight for fish and look after their children. All penguins are good parents--the male penguins are perhaps the best parents in the world. They choose their wives in the dark They can only hear them--not see them. Then the female penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months. The males look after the eggs. If the eggs get cold, there will be no chicks. There is no food. The snow falls and the wind blows--sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour. The penguins do not move. When the females return from the sea, they will not remember their husbands. It doesn't matter. Only one thing-- their eggs. Male penguins never fight--unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute. Then they fight because they all want it. They are strange and wonderful birds. It seems interesting and unusual that the male penguins choose their wives _ . A) when the female penguins return from the sea B) just by hearing in the darkness C) each time they see their lovely females D) after they have had their own grounds A:","response":"B) just by hearing in the darkness Penguins are fascinating creatures with unique social dynamics and behaviors. One of the most interesting aspects of penguin life is the way that they choose their mates, which adds to their appeal and mystery. In many penguin species, such as the Emperor and Adélie penguins, males select their wives solely based on vocalizations in the dark. During the mating season, penguins gather in large colonies, and male penguins use unique vocal calls to attract potential mates. Female penguins respond to these calls with their own distinct vocalizations, allowing males to locate them. This method of mate selection solely based on auditory communication is an unusual and captivating behavior of penguin mating rituals. The darkness of the environment in which penguins choose their mates is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it affords both male and female penguins some level of anonymity, ensuring that the focus remains on the quality of their vocal communication rather than their physical appearance. This can help eliminate biases based on looks and prevents more aggressive males from dominating mating opportunities. Secondly, the need to rely on auditory cues in the absence of visual ones can help foster stronger and more meaningful pair bonds. In challenging environments like the Antarctic, where temperatures can plummet and food can be scarce, penguins must rely on each other for survival. By choosing mates based on vocalizations alone, penguins are more likely to form bonds based on factors like trust and compatibility, which can be crucial for the survival of their offspring. Moreover, the act of choosing a mate through vocal communication in the dark showcases the penguins' remarkable auditory abilities. Penguins possess advanced hearing skills, allowing them to pick up and distinguish between various vocalizations, even in the middle of a crowded colony. This highlights the importance of communication among these remarkable birds and underscores their capacity for forming strong social bonds. In conclusion, penguins demonstrate a fascinating and unusual aspect of mate selection by choosing their wives solely based on hearing in the darkness. This method of mate selection allows them to focus on auditory communication and compatibility, fostering strong pair bonds crucial for the survival and well-being of their young. The unique and captivating behavior of penguins in selecting their mates is just one of many reasons why these birds continue to captivate and intrigue scientists and animal lovers alike."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: A jet, carrying French Caribbean islanders home from a Panama vacation, crashed in rural Venezuela early Tuesday, after the pilot reported trouble with the engines.

Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","response":"The supposed perturbation in this situation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. It is important to understand the process of nest-building and the different steps involved, as you have mentioned: 1. The bird picks a tree 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside 6. The nest is done. Now, if more people do not like trees and it leads to actions like cutting down trees or not planting enough trees, it would result in fewer trees for birds to choose from for nest-building. This situation would not directly impact the nest-building process itself, as birds are adaptable and resourceful creatures. Birds might resort to building nests on other structures like buildings, utility poles, or even in bushes and shrubs if necessary. However, the reduction in suitable trees would indirectly impact the first step of the process: the bird picking a tree. As there are fewer trees available for nest-building, the competition among birds for the optimal nesting spots would increase, which could lead to various consequences, such as: 1. Birds may resort to building nests in less ideal locations, potentially increasing their vulnerability to predators or exposing them to harsher environmental conditions, which could impact their reproductive success and population stability. 2. Birds may have to invest more time and energy in searching for suitable trees, leading to a decrease in their overall time and energy available for other essential tasks like foraging and caring for their young. 3. Certain bird species that are more specialized in their nesting habits or have specific tree preferences might struggle to find suitable nest sites, leading to a decline in their populations. 4. As a result of increased nest density in the remaining trees, diseases and parasites could spread more easily among bird populations, ultimately affecting their overall health and survival rates. In conclusion, the perturbation of more people not liking trees, and as a result, a decline in the number of available trees for nesting would indirectly impact the first step of the nest-building process. It would force birds to adapt to the changing environment and alter their strategies for securing suitable nesting sites, which could have numerous consequences on their overall well-being and population dynamics."},{"question":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954.

What is this text about?","response":"This text is about a failed flight attempt in June 2001 involving a vehicle named X-43A, which is an experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft developed by NASA as part of its Hyper-X program. The X-43A was designed to explore technologies related to hypersonic flights, which are speeds of at least five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). The ultimate goal of the program was to advance the knowledge and understanding of hypersonic aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion systems. The incident mentioned in the text refers to the first flight test of the X-43A that took place on June 2, 2001. During this test, the aircraft was attached to a modified Pegasus rocket, known as a booster rocket, which was supposed to propel the X-43A to the desired altitude and speed before the X-43A's own scramjet engine could be engaged. The rocket and aircraft combination is referred to as the \\"full stack.\\" Unfortunately, the flight test did not go as planned. Shortly after launch, the booster rocket started to become unstable and deviated from its intended flight path. As the rocket lost control, the situation became dangerous, posing a potential risk to public safety and the integrity of the mission. To avoid further complications and protect the people and property on the ground, the mission was terminated by ground controllers who remotely activated the rocket's self-destruct mechanism. The destruction of the full stack resulted in a loss of both the booster rocket and the X-43A experimental aircraft. Although this setback was a significant disappointment and represented a substantial financial loss, it also provided valuable data and information that was used to improve the design, control, and understanding of the X-43A and hypersonic flight technology in general. Following the failure of the initial flight attempt, two more flight tests were conducted with improved X-43A aircraft. The second test, held on March 27, 2004, was successful and the X-43A reached a top speed of Mach 6.83. The third and final test, on November 16, 2004, achieved a remarkable top speed of Mach 9.65. In conclusion, the text is about a failed first flight attempt of the X-43A, an experimental hypersonic aircraft developed by NASA. The 2001 incident involved an out-of-control booster rocket and resulted in the destruction of the rocket and the X-43A. Nonetheless, the learnings from this failure aided in the success of subsequent flight tests and helped advance the field of hypersonic flight technology."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate.

Via a flashback, we learn about the couple's humble beginnings and discover how they worked their way into the world of the nouveau riche. David is a Santa Rosa attorney with no clients, working on construction jobs with his law partner Robert Townsend to support his bride, who serves as the struggling firm's secretary. Finding herself pregnant, Joyce schemes to land Swanson, a former factory worker with a valuable steel-making patent, as a client. She succeeds at getting him to hire David alone, and when her plot eventually is discovered, Robert quits. David is furious with his wife, but she placates him by convincing him her sole intent was to help him and their unborn child. Back in the present, Joyce is forced to admit to her daughters their father has left her when a society columnist questions his move. She learns from a friend David has been seen with another woman and hires a private detective to investigate. Another flashback, and David, now an executive in Swanson's company, announces he has been transferred to San Francisco but wants to live in the suburbs.

Their attempts to warn humans of the danger are tragically misinterpreted as sophisticated tricks or amusing gimmicks for tidbits.

The foreman (Mark Longhurst) impatiently informs Arthur that the damage sustained to the bulldozer would be unnoticeable should it run over him. At that moment Arthur's best friend, Ford Prefect (Yasiin Bey), arrives with a shopping cart full of beer.

Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often). According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What school did Dr Nagoski graduate from? Options: - Harvard - Stanford - not enough information - Yale Answer:","response":"not enough information"},{"question":"Math Problem Solve -178*t - 254*t = 227*t - 141*t - 37296 for t.","response":"To solve the problem, we need to simplify the equation and isolate t. I'll walk you through the process step-by-step. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. The equation is: -178*t - 254*t = 227*t - 141*t - 37296 Combining like terms on both sides, we get: (-178 - 254)*t = (227 - 141)*t - 37296 Calculating those values: -432*t = 86*t - 37296 Step 2: Move terms with \\"t\\" on one side and the constant to the other side. To do this, we'll add 432*t to both sides: -432*t + 432*t = 86*t - 37296 + 432*t This simplifies to: 0 = 518*t - 37296 Step 3: Isolate t. Now, we'll move the constant 37296 to the left side by adding it to both sides: 37296 = 518*t Next, we'll divide both sides by 518 to isolate t: 37296 / 518 = 518*t / 518 Calculating this gives us: t ≈ 72 So, the value of t is approximately 72."},{"question":"Given the question: Fact 1: Aprism is used for refracting light.

Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless, though the number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area. It was the deadliest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed at least 240,000 people, and the strongest in the country since the 1950 Chayu earthquake, which registered at 8.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. It is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time.

It was the strongest earthquake in China since it occurred in 1950. It registered at 8.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale used to denote the strength or magnitude of an earthquake. Therefore, an earthquake measuring 8.5 is extremely powerful and damaging. The numbers present the energy that an earthquake releases - as the number increases by 1, the energy release is roughly 31.6 times more intense. Therefore, an earthquake of 8.5 would entail catastrophic damage. The Chayu earthquake was referred to in relation to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, noting that the latter was the deadliest since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, but not as strong as the 1950 Chayu earthquake.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.

Using a circular object like a cup, place the object down on the piece of paper and trace around it. The first solution is better for drawing a perfect circle because using a circular object as a guide ensures that the shape will be as close to a true circle as possible.

A coach containing Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol), a solicitor from London, and two Transylvanian natives, rocks up a mountanous path. Renfield says he's feeling queasy and one of the helpful natives leans out the window to tell the driver to slow down. Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town.When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition.By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats. Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count. Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps. He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed.

Answer:","response":"To address your concerns about investing in the film proposal for 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It,' I will provide you with information on the expert in obscure diseases, offer analysis on the film's potential, and answer any other questions you may have. Expert on Obscure Diseases: In the context of this specific film proposal, the expert on obscure diseases appears to not be explicitly mentioned in the provided plot synopsis. The focus is primarily on the classic figures associated with the Dracula story, such as Count Dracula and Thomas Renfield, rather than a character specializing in obscure diseases. In the context of the broader Dracula literary and cinematic universe, it could be argued that Professor Abraham Van Helsing functions as the expert on obscure diseases, particularly those related to vampirism. Film Potential Analysis: 1. Genre: This film takes a comedic approach to the classic horror tale of Dracula. Comedy films have a broad audience appeal, making them a moderately safe investment. A mix of horror and comedy can create a unique experience, appealing to fans of both genres. 2. Cast: Leslie Nielsen, known for his roles in comedy films such as 'Airplane!' and 'The Naked Gun' series, plays Count Dracula. His presence may attract his fans and those who appreciate his style of humor. 3. Plot: The Mel Brooks-directed movie appears to be a parody of the more traditional renditions of Dracula. Parody films can resonate with audiences familiar with the source material, potentially generating interest and positive word of mouth if executed well. 4. Director: Mel Brooks, the director, has a track record of successful comedic films, such as 'Young Frankenstein,' 'Blazing Saddles,' and 'Spaceballs.' His involvement in the film could be an indicator of its potential quality and appeal to a wide range of audiences. However, it's important to note that comedy preferences vary, and not all of Mel Brooks' films have been box office successes. 5. Marketability: Films surrounding the Dracula myth have had varying degrees of success, but the character is widely recognized, which increases marketability. A comedic take on a familiar and well-loved story can breathe new life into the tale and create opportunities for fresh marketing campaigns. Additional Points to Consider: 1. Budget: Look into the proposed film budget and whether it aligns with similar successful films in the genre. Striking a balance between production value and costs can impact profitability. 2. Distribution Strategy: Consider the plan for the film's release and distribution. A wide release or a targeted marketing approach may have different implications for return on investment. Ultimately, the decision to invest in the film proposal for 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It' depends on factors such as your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and personal preferences. The comedic approach distinguishes it from other Dracula films, and factors like a known director, established cast, and a recognizable story could contribute to its potential success. However, audience preferences for comedy and the execution of the film's humor are subjective and could dictate its reception in the market."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.

After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and is scolded by Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee), he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root.

But celebrating a victory that puts hundreds of dollars each year in the pockets of commuters is worth the trip, he says. McGovern plans to ride from Worcester to South Station on March 10 to draw attention to a recent increase in the amount of money train riders can set aside before taxes for their commuting costs. McGovern was one of the champions of the change, which Congress approved in December as part of broader tax legislation. Now, commuters across the country can set aside up to 255 a month from their paychecks, before federal taxes are taken out, for their train and van-pool passes. That’s up from 130 last year. This puts mass transit on par with a similar benefit that’s available for parking expenses, one that was 250 last year and is 255 this year. There’s one hitch, though: Commuters in Massachusetts can deduct the larger amount from their federal taxes, but not from their state taxes. The deduction remains stuck at 130, according to the state Department of Revenue, due to a quirk in state law. “The equalization doesn’t automatically happen under state law,” said Jay Darby, a tax attorney at law firm Sullivan & Worcester. “The [state] Legislature has to do something about it.” A McGovern spokesman referred questions on Monday about the hitch to Jason Pavluchuk, a lobbyist for the Association for Commuter Transportation. Pavluchuk said his group and McGovern’s team are trying to identify a solution at the state level. He said he’s aware of only two other states that face a similar issue. “It creates some administrative headaches [because] now you have to set up two tax systems, one you’re reporting to the feds and one you’re reporting to Massachusetts,” Pavluchuk said. “But it shouldn’t be a huge impediment to the adoption of this mass transit benefit.” In an interview earlier in the month, McGovern said he’s been pushing the transit-parity bill for five years. The mass transit subsidy had been increased in the past, but only temporarily. This time, McGovern said, the change is permanent. “The benefit for somebody who took their automobile to work was greater than for somebody who used public transportation, [and] it just seemed to me that it was backward,” McGovern said. “At the very minimum . . . somebody who is taking public transportation ought to get the same benefit.” Employers need to opt into the program for the cost of the passes to be deducted from workers’ paychecks. But more than 1,000 employers in Greater Boston already do so, with some offering their own subsidies. There are tax benefits for the companies, too, with the amount of total payroll taxes they owe to the federal government being reduced. Supporters of the change estimate that the increase in the transit subsidy could cost the federal government as much as 1.9 billion over 10 years. Write a one or two sentence summary.","response":"The US Congress approved an increase in the amount of money train riders can set aside before taxes for their commuting costs from 130 last year to 255 a month, making mass transit more affordable and on par with parking expenses benefits. This change could encourage more people to use public transportation, helping to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, while also potentially saving commuters hundreds of dollars each year."},{"question":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the nephew of Tyrconnel?

On the following night on \`\` Raw '' Daivari and Hassan Shawn interrupted Michaels during a promo . The following night on \`\` Raw '' , Shawn interrupted Michaels Daivari and Hassan during a promo . Available options: (a). no; (b). yes;","response":"(a). No; The two sentences provided do not mean the same thing, as they describe two different events. Let me explain the subtle differences between the two statements: 1. \\"On the following night on \`Raw\`, Daivari and Hassan Shawn interrupted Michaels during a promo.\\" This sentence describes an event in which Daivari and Hassan Shawn interrupted Michaels while he was performing a promo. In this case, Daivari and Hassan Shawn are the ones who initiate the interruption of Michaels, emphasizing their actions and involvement in the scene. 2. \\"The following night on \`Raw\`, Shawn interrupted Michaels Daivari and Hassan during a promo.\\" In this sentence, the event is reversed. Now, Shawn is interrupting Michaels, Daivari, and Hassan during a promo. The focus here is on Shawn's actions and how he interrupts the promo being performed by the three other individuals - Michaels, Daivari, and Hassan. In conclusion, although both statements seem similar at first glance, the subjects and objects of each sentence are different, resulting in different meanings. The first statement emphasizes Daivari and Hassan Shawn's interruption of Michaels, while the second statement highlights Shawn's interference with the promo featuring Michaels, Daivari, and Hassan. Thus, the correct option is (a) No, they do not mean the same thing."},{"question":"Ticoz is another favorite place to take out of town folks or people from outside the CenPho area.

The place was packed so we made the most of it. We offered to switch sides, but he wouldn't hear of it. The portions are good sized and they bring you chips (not even the best store bought) and salsa. The salsa has three varieties. When they first opened they had the best salsa in town with huge stewed tomato chunks. Now it is good, but... We like to get different things and share them here. One of the things that we often get is the tamale. We like it even meatless. I have had much better food, but they have a good mix of food, ambiance and service.

Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out! Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization, particularly of the shooting event? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at? Prince Albert's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here. The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full? 'Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. Yet loved the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? I always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so than with \\"Mrs. Brown\\" or even \\"The Queen\\". Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time.","response":"So, this review about the movie is mixed - that means the person has both good and bad things to say about it. The person enjoyed the movie and wanted to learn more about the history. They really liked the costumes and sets, the main actors were great too, and despite some parts they found distracting, they couldn't stop watching! On the other hand, they thought the movie may have overdramatized some things and didn't give enough information about the characters. They were also unsure about some of the behavior they saw on screen, like a princess talking with food in her mouth. So overall, it sounds like they liked watching the movie but felt it could have been even better!"},{"question":"Read this and answer the question Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested, with varying weight assigned by experts. The U.S. Senate's Levin–Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of \\"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\\" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by \\"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\\", \\"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\\", \\"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\\" by financial institutions, ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that \\"added to the uncertainty and panic\\", a \\"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\\", \\"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\\", deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps, and \\"the failures of credit rating agencies\\" to correctly price risk. The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States. Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets. Research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads. What practices should have been adjusted by governments to address 21st-century financial markets?","response":"In simple words, governments needed to change some rules and ways they watched over the money world to make sure everything is safe and fair in the 21st-century. Some of the things they should have done are: 1. Make better rules for checking on banks and other money businesses, so they don't take too many risks that can cause problems. 2. Make sure that big important banks and financial companies are managed in a good way, and that they are careful with the risks they take. 3. Help everyone understand more about the money stuff that banks and companies are doing, so that people don't get surprised when something goes wrong. 4. Teach and guide the people who are controlling the money businesses, so they can make better decisions and keep everything safe. 5. Make sure that the people and companies who give ratings or scores to different money products do a good job, so everyone knows if those products are safe or risky. 6. Fix the rules about home loans, so that people can't get loans they can't really afford, and then have troubles when they can't pay the loans back. 7. Keep an eye on new money products like insurance for loans (credit default swaps) and set some rules for them, so they don't become a big problem. By doing these things, governments could have done a better job at making the money world safer and more stable for everyone."},{"question":"In this task, you will be presented with a context passage, a question about that paragraph, and a possible answer to that question.

They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. I am facing a new situation today: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species would have higher chance of passing their genes on to the next genertion, rhino or impala? A:","response":"To answer the question correctly, we need to consider the key points from the background article: 1. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive increase their fitness. 2. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. 3. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. Now, let's apply these points to the new situation with rhinos and impalas: Both species, rhinos and impalas, have acquired behaviors in response to human encroachment of wildlife habitats. However, the impalas' behaviors help them and their young to survive, while the rhinos' behaviors mostly fail them in that aspect. Based on the information provided and by considering the key points from the background article, we can infer the following: - The impalas' acquired behaviors are more effective for survival, which increases their fitness. - As a result, impalas have a higher fitness level than rhinos in this context. - Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation (point 2 from the background article).

At 138 stories (1,800Â ft/550Â m), it is the world's tallest building. Shortly after his arrival, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door, leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings (and who is later disclosed to have died). Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation. Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze, which soon spreads out of control. SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor, directing them to express elevators. A guest, Lisolette Mueller, who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget. Duncan, aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey, directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe.

Question: suppose more encouragement is given to people who recycle happens, how will it affect people will be motivated. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","response":"If more encouragement is given to people who recycle, it would likely have a positive impact on their motivation to participate in recycling processes such as placing aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins. This encouragement could come in the form of increased public awareness campaigns, financial incentives, or social recognition for individuals or communities that excel in recycling efforts. Moreover, if the amount of support is considerably enhanced on an extensive scale, it can contribute to the creation of a stronger recycling culture and a more environmentally conscious society. This would likely lead to more people engaging in recycling activities, making it a more perceived norm and a socially valued behavior. Consequently, people who were previously not recycling might join the effort out of a desire to conform, feel included, or to make a positive impact on the environment. Additionally, the increased encouragement and heightened awareness of recycling benefits can also improve people's understanding of the critical role recycling plays in reducing resource waste, lowering energy consumption, and mitigating environmental issues such as pollution. An informed and educated public will be more inclined to engage in environmentally-friendly activities and may even spread the message to their peers, amplifying the impact of the original encouragement. Now, considering the second effect mentioned in the process – \\"Your town or a private company collects and transports the aluminum to a recycling facility\\" – the increased participation and motivation to recycle aluminum as a result of more encouragement can lead to a larger volume of aluminum being collected and transported to recycling facilities. This increased supply will likely result in more efficient recycling processes, as economies of scale come into play. Recycling facilities will be able to operate at a larger capacity, ultimately optimizing their production and output. In conclusion, more encouragement given to people to recycle aluminum would result in more people being motivated to participate in the recycling process, leading to a higher volume of aluminum collected and transported to recycling facilities. Consequently, the larger scale of recycling operations would positively influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the second step mentioned (collection and transportation), resulting in a more sustainable aluminum recycling system overall."},{"question":"Given the question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

Options: a ) 100 pi , b ) 144 pi , c ) 196 pi , d ) 80 , e ) 90","response":"First, we need to find the radius of the original circular green. We're given that the area of the original green is 49π square feet. We can use the formula for the area of a circle: Area = π * (Radius)^2 49π = π * (Radius)^2 (49π)/π = (Radius)^2 49 = (Radius)^2 Radius = 7 feet In August, the groundskeeper doubled the distance from the center of the green to the edge of the green, so the radius of the renovated green is now twice the original radius: New Radius = 2 * 7 = 14 feet Now we can find the area of the renovated green using the same formula: Area = π * (New Radius)^2 Area = π * (14)^2 Area = π * 196 Area = 196π So the total area of the renovated green is 196π square feet.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota. However, before Spota can be questioned, he is murdered. Montone is then found garroted. O'Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs in a meat locker that was shipped from the space station, but is... My question: How does O'Neil get rid of the hitmen? Answer:","response":"In the movie \\"Outland,\\" after uncovering the drug distribution ring and the involvement of Sheppard and Montone in it, O'Niel becomes a target for hitmen. Sheppard hires two professional assassins to eliminate O'Niel to stop him from interfering with the drug operation. To get rid of the hitmen, O'Niel utilizes his knowledge of the mining outpost and its technology to his advantage. He first suspects the hitmen's arrival due to the unusual docking of a cargo shuttle and prepares himself by planting explosive charges around the outpost. He also disables some of the outpost's security cameras to create blind spots in the surveillance system. As the hitmen arrive, O'Niel faces them both individually and engages in intense fights. During the battles, O'Niel lures them into the traps he has set. One of the hitmen is killed when O'Niel lures him into an area rigged with explosives, detonating them just as the hitman enters the area. For the second hitman, O'Niel confronts him directly, ultimately overpowering and killing him as well. By using his tactical skills and strategic planning, O'Niel overcomes the odds and successfully eliminates the hitmen sent to kill him."},{"question":"Consider the question.

It is a \`\`hard'' cap, meaning there are no exemptions (and thus no luxury tax penalties are required). Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you go over the salary cap in the nhl?","response":"Based on the information provided, you cannot go over the salary cap in the NHL. The NHL employs a \\"hard\\" cap, which means that there are no exemptions, unlike in some other sports leagues that have a \\"soft\\" cap with luxury tax penalties for exceeding the cap. The hard cap system ensures that all NHL teams operate under the same financial constraints, promoting competitive balance and preventing wealthier teams from monopolizing talent by outspending their rivals. The NHL salary cap is calculated based on the league's hockey-related revenues, with the aim of maintaining a stable financial environment for both the players and the franchises. Teams must ensure that their total player salaries remain within the limits of the cap, which is adjusted annually to reflect changes in revenues. This financial constraint forces teams to carefully manage their roster and make strategic decisions in order to stay compliant with the cap. There are, however, certain situations where teams may have temporary relief in case of injuries or other unforeseen circumstances. For example, teams can place a player who suffers from a long-term injury on the Long-Term Injured Reserve (LTIR), which allows the team to temporarily exceed the salary cap to replace that player. Nevertheless, once the injured player returns, the team must once again be compliant with the cap. In conclusion, you cannot go over the salary cap in the NHL, as it uses a hard cap system without any exemptions. This system is designed to promote fairness and competitive balance across the league, requiring teams to make strategic decisions when managing their roster and player salaries. Though there may be temporary solutions for unforeseen circumstances like injuries, the overall cap structure remains a key element in maintaining a level playing field in the league."},{"question":"Given the following reasoning and answer, what was the question?

On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted... answer the following question: What date did Jimi Hendrix play Maple Leaf Gardens?

Its main scriptures are the Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana. Some scholars disagree, and have proposed many other theories.\\" Answer: A:","response":"In addition to the key teachings mentioned in the context, Gautama Buddha taught several other principles and practices that formed an integral part of Pre-sectarian Buddhism. These include: 1. Mindfulness and meditation: Buddha emphasized the importance of mindfulness and meditation in achieving a deeper understanding of oneself and the world. These practices help individuals develop concentration, insight, and mental tranquility, which are essential for spiritual progress. 2. The practice of loving-kindness (Metta): Buddha taught the importance of cultivating loving-kindness towards all sentient beings. This practice fosters compassion, empathy, and understanding, which are essential for personal growth and harmonious relationships with others. 3. The Middle Way: Gautama Buddha advocated for a balanced approach to life, known as the Middle Way. This philosophy emphasizes avoiding extremes of indulgence and self-denial, focusing instead on finding a moderate and balanced path to spiritual development. 4. Morality (Sila): Buddha stressed the importance of ethical conduct as a foundation for spiritual progress. This includes following the Five Precepts, which are basic moral guidelines for Buddhists to live by. These precepts are: abstaining from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and consuming intoxicants. 5. The practice of generosity (Dana): Buddha encouraged his followers to practice generosity as a means to cultivate letting go of attachment and developing a sense of interconnectedness with others. This can include giving material support to others, offering emotional support, or sharing knowledge. 6. The Six Perfections (Paramitas): In order to progress on the path to enlightenment, practitioners are encouraged to develop six qualities known as the Six Perfections. These are generosity, morality, patience, effort, concentration, and wisdom. By combining these additional teachings with the central doctrines like the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, karma and rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and nirvana, Gautama Buddha provided a comprehensive spiritual framework for his followers to achieve liberation from suffering."},{"question":"Given the following passage \\"Raymond B.

However, at some point during or after the construction, the ship was transferred to the United States Navy. Nevertheless, the navy decided not to commission it, and \\"Puritan\\" never attained the status of an active naval vessel serving the navy's fleet. As a result, it was classified as an auxiliary minelayer, but never officially became a \\"United States Ship\\" or received the USS prefix. In conclusion, taking the provided paragraph into account, it is accurate to say that \\"Puritan\\" was not commissioned. Despite being transferred to the United States Navy and classified as an auxiliary minelayer, the ship did not become an actively operational part of the navy's forces and lacked the customary USS prefix denoting commissioned status."},{"question":"Q:What are the full names of the people who have a father who dies of a stroke?

Can we infer the following? the aboriginal people are glad to go back to the Charlottetown accord","response":"Based on the provided information and the context, it is not entirely accurate to infer that all aboriginal people are glad to go back to the Charlottetown accord. Nonetheless, we can analyze the case being made, the significance of the territories in the bill, the rights of aboriginal people as established in the constitution, and the relevance of the Charlottetown accord to understand the complexities surrounding this issue. Firstly, the mention of the territories in the bill is essential in recognizing their unique position within the country and emphasizing the importance of their inclusion in legislative measures. Territories have distinct rights and responsibilities compared to provinces and, as such, need to be considered carefully in legal processes and agreements. By listing the territories explicitly, the bill acknowledges the distinctions and demonstrates a commitment to preserving the rights and cultural heritage of the people living there. The rights of aboriginal people are firmly enshrined in the constitution, which provides a solid legal foundation for upholding their rights and protecting their interests. By identifying their constitutional rights, the state acknowledges the historical context that has shaped their lives and commits to safeguarding those rights in the present and future. When it comes to the Charlottetown accord, different perspectives and opinions come into play. The accord was an effort to address the constitutional concerns of several groups, including aboriginal peoples, and in many ways, it sought to advance their rights. Indigenous leaders like Ovide Mercredi were involved, giving the accord a sense of representativeness and inclusivity. However, the accord ultimately failed to gain the approval that it needed and never became law. Despite its failure, the Charlottetown accord's inclusion and consideration of aboriginal people still hold historical significance. In particular, it marked an important step in recognizing indigenous rights and the need for meaningful engagement with aboriginal leaders in the broader political context. Given this background, some aboriginal people might feel positively about the Charlottetown accord because of the engagement it represented and its attempt to advance indigenous rights. However, it would be an overgeneralization to assume that all aboriginal people are glad to go back to the accord. People's opinions and perspectives will vary depending on various factors, including personal experiences, political views, and cultural perspectives. In conclusion, while it is not accurate to infer that all aboriginal people are glad to go back to the Charlottetown accord, its historical significance and role in recognizing and advancing indigenous rights cannot be ignored. The bill's acknowledgment of the territories and the constitutional rights of aboriginal people are essential components in fostering an environment that respects and addresses the unique needs of indigenous communities."},{"question":"Q: For many kids playing baseball is an American pastime, it brings them great what to play? Options: - sore muscles - injury - errors - happiness - sadness A: happiness Explain how we arrive at this answer:","response":"We are given a list of options regarding the effects of playing baseball for many kids. We are looking for a positive outcome associated with playing baseball as an American pastime. Let's analyze each option step by step: 1. Sore muscles: This is a physical outcome, and not necessarily a positive or enjoyable aspect of playing baseball. 2. Injury: This is a negative outcome and not related to the enjoyment kids might find in playing the game. 3. Errors: This refers to mistakes made during the game, which is also not directly related to the enjoyment of playing. 4. Happiness: This is a positive emotional outcome that can be associated with enjoying baseball and having a good time while playing. As the question refers to baseball as an American pastime, which is often seen as a source of entertainment and pleasure, this option makes the most sense. 5.

Context: What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon.

Australia. D). Austria. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

Shortly after his court vindication, Senator Mike Duffy returned to charging taxpayers for some of his Ottawa living expenses. According to the Senate's quarterly proactive disclosure report, Duffy claimed 1,691.59 in National Capital Region expenses between March and June of 2016. These are the types of claims that led to the Senate expenses scandal in the first place, and prompted an overhaul of the rules and regulations for the Upper Chamber. \\"I filed my claims as the Senate rules provide, and was approved by Senate administration, and as Judge Vaillancourt agreed were valid,\\" Duffy told CBC News in an email. Before the scandal broke in 2013, it had been widely known that Duffy, who represents Prince Edward Island, had lived in Ottawa for more than two decades during his time as a television broadcaster. Duffy's previous expense claims led to a criminal investigation, and he was charged with 31 counts of fraud and breach of trust. After a year-long legal saga, Duffy was found not guilty on all charges in a resounding victory issued by Justice Charles Vaillancourt. While Duffy's previous claims landed him in court, there appears to be no uncertainty about whether he is entitled to make Ottawa living expense claims now. Senate administration confirms Duffy is well within the rules, as he has proved he is a resident of Prince Edward Island. In an email to CBC News, Senate spokeswoman Jacqui Delaney says \\"as per the new rule adopted in May 2013, Senator Duffy has submitted a Declaration of Provincial/Territorial Residence and National Capital Accommodation with the following supporting documents: \\"This declaration and supporting documents must be submitted annually,\\" Delaney added. After learning of Duffy's new Ottawa expense claims, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation is questioning whether the Senate's new rules on expenses go far enough. \\"After Mr Duffy was acquitted, there was a lot of concern about the rules and whether the rules were tight enough,\\" said Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the CTF. \\"We were assured by the Senate that the rules had been tightened, and that they had been changed. But if he's still able to claim, that suggests that the rules haven't been tightened enough,\\" Wudrick added. \\"It's the same issue with his trial. He was technically within the rules, but that just casts aspersions on the rules. It suggests the rules mean nothing if you can actually live within them and still get away with this,\\" Wudrick said. Mike Duffy's residency - whether he lives in Ottawa or P.E.I., the province he represents in the Senate - was at the centre of his long-running fraud and breach of trust trial. In the end, the judge saw it his way, finding the Senate rules unclear. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) But some of Duffy's colleagues are more supportive of his claims. \\"He is able to claim expenses in accordance with Senate rules like any other senator,\\" said Senator Peter Harder, one of the Upper Chamber's newest members. \\"As you know, these [rules] have been significantly clarified and made for more transparency in the past two years,\\" Harder added. The Prime Minister's Office wouldn't comment specifically on Duffy's new expense claims. \\"We remain confident in the prime minister's new approach to make the Senate less partisan and more independent,\\" PMO spokesman Cameron Ahmad said in an email to CBC News. What was this article about?","response":"This article discusses Senator Mike Duffy's return to claiming living expenses in Ottawa after being vindicated in court. In 2013, Duffy was involved in the Senate expenses scandal, which led to an overhaul of the expense claim rules for the Upper Chamber in Canada. According to the Senate's quarterly proactive disclosure report, Duffy claimed 1,691.59 in National Capital Region expenses between March and June of 2016. Duffy faced 31 counts of fraud and breach of trust in relation to his previous expense claims, but he was found not guilty on all charges. Currently, he is allowed to make living expense claims as he has proven to be a resident of Prince Edward Island, and the Senate administration confirms he is acting within the rules. However, his new expense claims have raised concerns among the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, questioning whether the Senate's new rules on expenses are sufficient. Aaron Wudrick, the federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, raises doubts over the effectiveness of the rules and calls for more scrutiny. On the other hand, Senator Peter Harder and other colleagues support Duffy's claims, arguing that he is claiming expenses according to the Senate rules like any other senator. They point out that the rules have been significantly clarified and improved transparency in the past two years. The Prime Minister's Office did not comment on Duffy's new expense claims directly but reaffirmed the prime minister's approach to making the Senate less partisan and more independent."},{"question":"Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die.

The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Want more information on the brief story? A simple touch makes the entire text appear. Save it in your own personal computer if you like. These are among the predictions from communication experts working on the newspaper of the future. Pictured as part of broader home based media and entertainment systems, computer newspapers would unite print and broadcast reporting, offering news and analysis with video images of news events. Most of the technology is available now, but convincing more people that they don't need paper to read a newspaper is the next step. But resistance to computer newspapers may be stronger from within journalism. Since it is such a cultural change, it may be that the present generation of journalists and publishers will have to die off before the next generation realize that the newspaper industry is no longer a newspaper industry. Technology is making the end of traditional newspapers unavoidable. Despite technological advances, it could take decades to replace news-print with computer screens. It might take 30 to 40 years to complete the changeover because people need to buy computers and because newspapers have established financial interests in the paper industry.

The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand.

Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed.

First, you will need to know whether your television even has the features required to make it mountable. Find out if your plasma tv is vesa compatible to ensure that it can be mounted.","response":"If your plasma TV is indeed VESA compatible, begin by selecting the appropriate wall mount or bracket that corresponds with your television's dimensions and weight capacity. This is crucial to ensure the stability and safety of the mounted TV. Take the time to research and invest in a high-quality mounting bracket, as it will serve as the foundation for your television setup and greatly influence the integrity of the installation. When purchasing a mounting bracket, look for one that is adjustable to provide flexibility in positioning the TV for optimal viewing angles. Once you have your mount, gather the necessary tools and materials for the installation, such as a power drill, stud finder, level, screwdriver, tape measure, and wall anchors. Before you proceed with mounting, evaluate the layout of your room and the desired height of the TV in relation to the fireplace. Ensure that you have ample distance between the TV and fireplace to prevent damage from heat, soot, or smoke. It is highly recommended to consult your television's user manual for specific guidelines on heat and clearance requirements. Now that you have determined the position of the TV, use your stud finder to locate the wall studs, as these will serve as the secure anchor points for the mounting bracket. Mark the spots where you will drill holes into the studs. Make certain that the holes are evenly spaced and can accommodate the bracket's screw holes for an even and balanced installation. Next, hold the mounting bracket against the wall at the desired height and marked locations, using the level to confirm that it is perfectly horizontal. After this, drill pilot holes into the wall studs and proceed to mount the bracket securely using the provided screws and wall anchors. Ensure the bracket is firmly fastened to the wall and can support the weight of your plasma television. With the mounting bracket securely in place, you can now proceed to attach the corresponding mounting plates or rails to the back of your TV. This may involve removing or loosening any existing stands or bases that may interfere with the attachment. Follow the instructions provided with the mount for proper alignment and attachment of the mounting plates or rails, ensuring that they are properly tightened and secured according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, with the help of a friend or family member, carefully lift and position the plasma TV on the wall mount, aligning the mounting plates or rails with the bracket. The TV should slide into place smoothly and lock securely, either with built-in mechanisms or the provided mounting hardware. Double-check that the locking mechanism is engaged, the screen is level, and the TV is stable against the wall.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.\\", answer the following question.

Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death. - The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year. - \`\` The Canterville Ghost '' is a short story by Oscar Wilde , widely adapted for the screen and stage . It was the first of Wilde 's stories to be published . The story is about a family who moves to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman , who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife 's brothers . - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'the canterville ghost'? Choices: - account - activity - category - censorship - classification - concrete - culture - death - degree - embedding - fiction - five - genre - history - hundred - idea - incident - invention - july - literature - magazine - mode - monthly magazine - mood - narrative - novel - novella - october - person - play - prose - public - publication - sentence - sharing - short story - synonym - term - variety - video - work - year","response":"The object entity that has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'the canterville ghost' is \\"short story.\\""},{"question":"Information: - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming.

The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 .

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Sire Records is an American record label, owned by Warner Music Group and distributed by Warner Bros.

Marni Kinrys, a U.S. dating coach, says holding in urine for five seconds at a time strengthens the Kegel, or pelvic, muscles. This, in turn, can improve a man’s performance in the bedroom if practised often enough. Holding in urine can control and prolong a man's ejaculation, as this strengthens the Kegel muscles. Previous studies show 40 per cent of men will suffer premature ejaculation at one point (file photo) Kegel, or pubococcygeus (PC) muscles help with bladder function and ejaculation, but become weaker or stretched as men and women age. Ms Kinrys says strengthening these muscles, just as one would strengthen any other muscle group, allows men to last longer between the sheets. When a person stops urinating mid-stream, the Kegel muscles are activated. In a video posted to Youtube, Ms Kinrys explains: ‘Kegel exercises are something you can do everywhere, at every moment in your life. Driving in a car, in your office, sitting at the doctors. ‘They control your pubococcygeus (PC) muscles so you can control ejaculation and prolong ejaculation’ ‘You want to work your way up to 50 reps a day, a rep being clenching your PC muscles for three to five seconds, and then releasing. Working these muscles has been shown to help with premature ejaculation. To identify the muscles sit relaxed and tighten the muscle around the back passage, as if trying to control wind. You should be able to feel the muscle move. With the correct technique you should feel a dip at the base of the penis, while the scrotum moves up slightly. To perform the exercises: sit, stand or lie with your knees slightly apart. Slowly tighten and pull up the pelvic floor muscles as hard as you can for as long as you can. Rest for four seconds then repeat. Build up until you can do 10 slow contractions at a time, holding them for 10 seconds each. Results are only likely to be seen after daily practice for three months. Source: Bladder and Bowel foundation. ‘You start off by doing 1 to 20 reps then work up to doing 50 reps. ‘Then you want to increase the time from 5 to 7 seconds. Keep increasing from there.’ ‘This will help strengthen your PC muscles so you never have to worry about premature ejaculation again.’ Up to 40 per cent of men suffer from premature ejaculation - defined by the International Society of Sexual Medicine as ejaculation 'within a minute' - at some point in their lives. In most men, the cause is simply being unable to control the ejaculatory response, explains Wendy Hurn, urology nurse consultant at Bristol Royal Infirmary. ‘Some may have more sensitive nerve endings, however stress or pressure can also make the problem worse,' she said. Pelvic floor exercises are often used to help male incontinence, especially after surgery such as operations for prostate cancer. Italian research published last year found that carrying out Kegel exercises daily for 12 weeks increased the average ejaculation time four-fould. The average ejaculation time was 31.7 seconds at the beginning of the trial, but after 12 weeks of exercises this had increased to 146.2 seconds (two minutes and 26 seconds). In total, 33 of the 40 men improved within 12 weeks. Only five men showed no significant improvement. Two had dropped out of the trial early, after showing an improvement. Ms Kinrys recommends clenching when going to the loo for three to five seconds, and repeating this 50 times throughout the day. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"1. Strengthening Kegel muscles can help men control and prolong ejaculation. 2. Holding in urine for five seconds at a time can help strengthen these muscles. 3.

Consider a gay couple that marries in one state and retires in another; or the couple whose marriage is recognized within their military base in Mississippi but not in Mississippi itself. One possible solution: The Human Rights Campaign vows to make gay marriage legal in all 50 states within five years, reports the Los Angeles Times. For now, the immediate game plan is to roll out campaigns in Illinois, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, and Hawaii in the coming months to try to increase the number of states where gay marriage is legal. But ultimately, it's a good bet that this is going back to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruing on whether gay marriage is a constitutional right, reports the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Congress may have to clarify rules to accommodate the DOMA decision, making sure that gay couples get their federal benefits. But at least one House conservative hopes to clarify things in the opposite direction: Tim Huelskamp plans to file a constitutional amendment within a week to reinstate DOMA, reports the Washington Post. President Obama, meanwhile, touched on the overall issue today in Africa, notes Poltico: “It’s my personal belief—and I’m speaking now as a president [not] as a lawyer—if you’re married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you’re still married.\\" But he cautioned that White House lawyers were still unraveling yesterday's decisions. Expand this summary.","response":"Yesterday's Supreme Court rulings in favor of recognizing gay marriage have brought attention to the complex patchwork of state and federal laws that often conflict with each other. Various scenarios, such as couples marrying in one state and retiring in another or military personnel confronting different regulations on and off-base, create significant confusion. The Human Rights Campaign is striving to legalize gay marriage in all 50 states within five years, with an immediate focus on Illinois, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, and Hawaii. In the meantime, Congress may need to clarify rules addressing the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) decision to ensure that gay couples receive federal benefits. However, conservative voices, like House member Tim Huelskamp, are pushing back and seeking to reinstate DOMA through a constitutional amendment. President Obama, speaking in Africa, expressed his personal belief that marriage should be recognized across state borders, adding that White House lawyers are still deciphering the implications of the court rulings. It is highly likely that the issue of whether gay marriage is a constitutional right will eventually return to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruling. This complex legal landscape reflects the nation's ongoing struggles and debates surrounding the recognition and rights of gay marriages. The recent Supreme Court decisions offer some progress and victories for gay rights advocates, but the road to nationwide legalization and acceptance is still far from complete. Advocacy groups, politicians, and the courts will continue to navigate the intricacies of state and federal laws in an effort to create a more cohesive and equitable legal framework for all."},{"question":"Poté se Harry začal pomalu a klidně probírat ze svých snů, takže pot, který mu vyrazil po těle, měl čas uschnout, a když na dveře zaklepal Darcy Clarke a mumlal něco o snídani, byl už zcela vzhůru, ale také již věřil, že konečně přišel na to, jak má celou tu záležitost dál hrát….

Cult run by Otto Mühl who was later jailed for sexually abusing minors. Made experiences into documentary, My Fathers, My Mother And Me. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Discovering Paul-Julien Robert's Story: A Little Boy's Life in a Big Commune Once upon a time, in a place near Vienna, there was a group of people living together in a large house called the Friedrichshof commune. They all believed in sharing everything with each other, like food, clothes, and even parents. In this big family, a little boy named Paul-Julien Robert was born, and he had many other kids to play with. The man who started this group where people lived together was Otto Mühl. He thought that living in a big family and sharing everything would make people happy. Many people believed Otto and chose to live with him and others in the Friedrichshof commune. However, after some time, it was discovered that Otto Mühl had done very bad things. He hurt some children who were living in the commune by touching them in ways they didn't like. This made people very sad and angry, and Otto Mühl was sent to jail for his actions. As Paul-Julien grew up, he wanted to share his experiences with the world. He decided to make a movie called \\"My Fathers, My Mother And Me,\\" which is like a family album that he can show to others. In this movie, Paul-Julien tells the story of his childhood, both the good times and the bad times. He talks about the games he would play with his friends and how he felt living in the Friedrichshof commune. The movie also shows how life changed for Paul-Julien when people discovered the bad things Otto Mühl did. It tells the story of how the big family that Paul-Julien lived in broke apart and how he had to find a new way to live. Through his movie, Paul-Julien teaches us about the courage to face difficult memories and how important it is to talk about them. In conclusion, \\"My Fathers, My Mother And Me\\" is a very special movie that shares the story of a little boy and his life in the Friedrichshof commune. It shows us that, even when we experience tough situations, we can find the strength to move forward and create a better life. Just like Paul-Julien, we should always remember to be brave and share our stories with others. This way, we can learn from each other and make the world a better, more loving place for everyone."},{"question":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), now 32 years old and head of his late uncle's international conglomerate, is appointed Ambassador to Great Britain, the same position his adoptive father held in the first film. Unlike the previous Omen films, the adult Damien is now entirely aware of his unholy lineage, and his destiny.An alignment of the stars in the Cassiopeia region of the night sky causes the generation of a 'superstar', described in the film as a second Star of Bethlehem. Thorn realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming of Christ and he orders all boys in England born on the morning of March 24, 1982 (the morning when, in the story, the Cassiopeia alignment occurred) to be killed in order to prevent the Christ-child's return to power.A subplot deals with one of Thorn's disciples, Harvey Dean, attempting to hide the fact that his own son was born at the appointed time; Dean not only fails at hiding that fact about his child from Damien, but is killed by his own hypnotized wife - likely in retaliation for refusing to go through with Damien's command to murder his son as a test of loyalty (the last child whom Damien suspects).Thorn has also become romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), a complex relationship which undermines his plans for political dominion for the time being. But Damien is not deterred from his plans and even focuses his attention on her preadolescent son Peter (Barnaby Holm), whom he takes as a disciple, partly by manipulating and exploiting the boy's internal desire to have a father-figure.Meanwhile, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi) and six other priests armed with the seven daggers of Megiddo - ancient holy weapons which are the only Earthly weapons which can harm the Antichrist - hunt Thorn in the hope of killing him before he can destroy the Christ-child. However, one by one, Damien kills off all the priests (some in horrific circumstances) until only DeCarlo survives.Finally, in spite of Thorn's efforts, DeCarlo informs Reynolds that the Christ-child is out of his...

Step 2: Evaluate the options - To complete this task, I will consider each available option and assess whether it aligns with the typical feeling a human might experience in the described situation. A. let down - This option seems appropriate, as a person may feel betrayed or disappointed when their friends ditch them. B. better himself - This option doesn't directly address the emotions a person feels when their friends ditch them. It may be an outcome of the situation, but it's not an emotional response. C. bored - This option could be a possibility, as a person might feel bored if their friends aren't present. However, it doesn't fully address the emotional impact of being ditched.

And I was wondering What will happen to Others? Choose your answer from: *swim *bored *loved Answer:","response":"Your question is slightly ambiguous, and it seems like you're asking what will happen to other people around or related to the couple - Lee and the teacher whose honeymoon location was Hawaii. If we are discussing three options — swim, bored, or loved — none of them can provide a precise answer directly as none individually outlines a standard reaction to someone else's honeymoon unless put into context. Still, I can provide a detailed analysis based on each of them. If we choose \\"Swim\\" and interpret it literally, it could mean that since Lee and his spouse are off on their honeymoon, others might take advantage to have their own mini vacations too. With Hawaii as an influence, those who enjoy water-related activities might see this as an opportunity to engage in swimming, whether it's going to a local swimming pool, a nearby beach, or organizing their own trips to destinations that allow swimming. \\"Bored\\" seems to suggest that, in the absence of Lee and the other teacher, people in their circle, such as colleagues or students, might feel a void and thus be bored, especially if the couple played significant roles in their daily lives. If they were engaging or charismatic, their absence might make the usual day-to-day life less interesting during their honeymoon period. On the other hand, if we go with \\"Loved,\\" it would imply that the other people might feel a sense of happiness or joy for the couple. Love, in this sense, would be more of emotional support and well wishes for their union. People often feel a sense of love when they see a happy couple, especially if there's a strong relationship between them. This could strengthen the bonds of their community, inspire others to become closer with their loved ones, or motivate single people to pursue their romantic interests. Again, these are interpretations based on the options provided and the broader context might alter the reaction. However, it's unusual that the responses would be so limited. People's reactions to others' life events can be very diverse and multifaceted."},{"question":"Find the right ending to this passage. Shocking footage has emerged of an Ohio woman handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest after sheriff’s deputies pinned her down on the floor pried open her mouth to retrieve a Tylenol tablet. Surveillance video shows Siobhan Householder, 35, of Akron, being confronted last week by a police officer after she took the prescription medication – the altercation left her injured and arrested. Householder was in a holding area while waiting to make a court appearance when she took the medication for a tooth infection, she told the Akron Beacon-Journal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Forced to the ground: Siobhan Householder is shown on the ground as the sheriff's deputy tries to force her mouth open","response":"The situation escalated quickly as the police officer noticed Householder taking the Tylenol tablet and deemed it as a potential violation of the rules within the holding area. Despite her attempt to explain that she was in pain from a tooth infection, the officers were concerned that the medication she had could be illicit drugs. In the surveillance video, the sheriff's deputies confronted Householder, who appears to be in distress, attempting to communicate her medical issue. The deputies, however, seemed to be unresponsive to her plea and proceeded to take physical action against her. They forcibly pinned her down on the floor and pried her mouth open, in a desperate attempt to retrieve the Tylenol tablet from her mouth. Householder sobbed and cried out in pain, as the deputies continued with their aggressive intervention. The horrifying scene was captured on video, which has since sparked outrage and debate about the use of excessive force and police misconduct. Householder sustained injuries during the altercation, including bruises and a swollen face. The incident has raised questions about the necessity of such brutal force to handle a situation where the individual claims to be in pain and is merely trying to alleviate their discomfort. Critics argue that Householder posed no significant threat to the officers or herself, and the deputies had no reasonable basis to treat her in such a demeaning and violent manner. Following the incident, Householder was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing official business. The victim and her family, along with several civil rights advocates, demanded that the charges against her be dropped and that the deputies be held accountable for their actions. Ultimately, after an extensive review, the charges were dismissed, as the prosecutor's office acknowledged that there were demonstrable errors in the handling of Householder's case. In the wake of this disturbing episode, the Akron Police Department asserted their commitment to learning from the incident and implementing necessary changes to prevent such cases of excessive force in the future. The department pledged to conduct thorough and comprehensive training for both new and existing officers, focused on de-escalation techniques and better communication skills with individuals in distress. As the video went viral and calls for police reform grew louder in the community and nationwide, the Akron Police Department found itself in the spotlight once again. The incident served as a clear reminder of the urgency to address the systemic issues within law enforcement to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of all citizens. In summary, the distressing encounter between Siobhan Householder and the sheriff's deputies ended with her charges being dismissed and acknowledgment of misconduct by the officers involved. The incident prompted renewed calls for police reform and successful implementation of de-escalation techniques, ultimately paving the way for improvements in police practices and procedures in Akron and beyond."},{"question":"News article: 300 vials labeled influenza, dengue found at lab The same federal scientist who recently found forgotten samples of smallpox at a federal lab also uncovered over 300 additional vials, many bearing the names of highly contagious viruses and bacteria. Food and Drug Administration officials said Wednesday the undocumented collection contained 327 carefully packaged vials, listing pathogens like dengue, influenza and rickettsia. Last week the government only disclosed that it had recovered six glass vials of smallpox dating from the 1950s. The new revelations raise serious concerns about the government's ability to secure its collections of potentially deadly pathogens. \\"The reasons why these samples went unnoticed for this long is something we're actively trying to understand,\\" said FDA deputy director for biologics Dr. Peter Marks. The samples, including those labeled smallpox, were found in 12 boxes in a corner of a cold storage room at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, that has been used by the Food and Drug Administration since 1972. FDA officials estimate the collection was assembled between 1946 and 1964 by government scientists. \\"The fact that these materials were not discovered until now is unacceptable,\\" said Karen Midthun, of FDA's director for biologics. \\"However, upon finding these materials our staff did the right thing - they immediately notified the appropriate authorities who secured the materials and determined there was no exposure.\\" FDA scientists said they have not yet confirmed whether the newly disclosed vials actually contained the pathogens listed on their labels. The agency is conducting a nationwide search of all cold storage units for any other missing samples. Investigators destroyed 32 vials containing tissue samples and a non-contagious virus related to smallpox. Several unlabeled vials were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing and the remaining 279 samples were shipped to the Department of Homeland Security for safekeeping. FDA officials said there is no evidence anyone was exposed to any of the agents, which were packed in heat-sealed glass vials with no signs of leakage. The finding of freeze-dried smallpox samples was disturbing because smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia. It was the second recent incident in which a U.S. government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous biologic agent. Last month, scores of employees at the CDC in Atlanta were feared exposed to anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse. The CDC began giving them antibiotics as a precaution. In separate congressional testimony Wednesday, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden acknowledged that systemic safety problems have for years plagued federal public health laboratories that handle dangerous germs such as anthrax and bird flu. Frieden added that his agency had long thought of the lapses as unrelated accidents.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

Here is the chain of thought and solution for this question: 1. Define key terms: - \\"Fake news\\": False or misleading information that is presented as genuine news. - \\"Accelerated learning\\": Improved or faster learning or skill development. - \\"The arts\\": Various forms of creative expression, including visual arts, performing arts, and literary arts. 2. Analyze the potential connection between fake news and learning in the arts: - Fake news can potentially inspire artistic expression as a response or criticism of false information. This may push artists to create more thought-provoking work. - It is possible that fake news could make people more discerning of information, which indirectly may improve critical thinking skills. These skills could, in turn, have an impact on learning in the arts. - Alternatively, fake news might obstruct learning in the arts as it could distort the truth and history of artistic movements or works, making it harder for people to learn and appreciate them. 3. Consider evidence and research on the topic: - There is limited evidence that directly links fake news to accelerated learning in the arts. Most research on fake news focuses on its impact on politics and public opinion, not necessarily on creative processes or learning outcomes in arts education. 4. Conclusion: - While it's possible to construct hypothetical scenarios in which fake news might have an indirect, tangential effect on learning in the arts, there is insufficient evidence to support a definitive causal relationship. - As a result, the statement \\"Fake news accelerated learning in the arts\\" cannot be considered conclusively true."},{"question":"Q:Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less global warming happens, how will it affect a BIGGER cake. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","response":"The perturbation hypothesis presented here examines the potential impact of less global warming on the process of making a bigger cake. We will consider each step of the process individually to determine if the supposed perturbation has direct or indirect effects on the overall process. 1. Gather the ingredients for the cake: A reduction in global warming could lead to changes in agricultural production. As temperatures stabilize, there may be a shift in agricultural zones, potentially affecting the availability and cost of certain ingredients. For example, if wheat production moves to more suitable climate regions, it could impact the accessibility and cost of flour. However, this effect would be indirect and likely minimal for most individual consumers. 2. Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make the batter: This step is unlikely to be affected directly by changes in global warming. However, if changes in agricultural production do occur (as discussed above), there may be subtle differences in the taste or texture of the final product due to fluctuations in ingredient quality. This would remain an indirect effect. 3. Pour the mixture into a cake pan: As cake batter contains water, it would lose some water to evaporation during cooking, but any effect of global warming would be negligible. Regardless of the external environment, the process of pouring batter into a pan will remain unaffected. 4. Place the cake in the oven to cook: Cooking a bigger cake is similar regardless of the amount of global warming. The temperature within the oven is controlled, and it will not be directly influenced by external temperature fluctuations. Indirectly, less global warming could potentially impact energy sources fueling the oven or the efficiency of the oven insulation, but the overall effect on this step should be minimal. 5. Take the cake out when it is cooked through: Less global warming will have no direct or indirect effect on this step, as the decision to take the cake out is primarily dictated by its internal temperature and visual cues like browning. 6. Let the cake cool: A larger cake will require longer cooling times, and less global warming could minimally influence this step. Cooler and more stable external temperatures could speed up the cooling process without any substantial negative effects on the overall process. 7. Serve the cake: The impact of less global warming on cake serving will be negligible. Any potential influences, such as improved ingredient quality or slight changes in taste or texture, would arguably be too small to significantly impact the consumer experience. In summary, while there may be a few indirect effects from less global warming to the process of making a bigger cake, these impacts are limited and relatively minimal. Most of the process remains unaffected by the supposed perturbation, and any potential changes would not drastically change the overall method or quality of the final product."},{"question":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie opens with a still photo of 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon:Rifleman Pvt.

I had decided to try for a job in radio. One day, I wanted to host a sports program. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I got turned down every time. In one station, a kind lady said my problem was that I hadn't got enough experience. \\" Get some work with a small station and work your way up,\\" she said. I went back home. I couldn't get a job there, either. Then my dad told me a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job. I felt really down. \\" Your luck will change,\\" Mom said to me. Dad lent me the car to help me to look for my job. I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone. As I left his office, I asked, \\"How can someone be a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station?\\" I was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call. \\" What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\\" He put me in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, I succeeded. On my way home, Mom's words came back to me, \\"One day your luck will change, Son.

Question: Who was the plaintiff in Baze v. Rees? Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

I met him about three years ago. After knowing me for six months, he told me about his struggles with depression . Sadness was not the only feeling that came over me; I was shocked. He seemed so outgoing and happy all the time. I soon learned that he was hurt physically and mentally as a young child, causing him to have the thought of killing himself. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. However, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak. Therefore, when it comes to helping him, convenience is not in my vocabulary. It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, for he always comes first. Many students at his school laugh at him when they notice scars on his arms from cutting. As he sees it, other kids have every right to make fun of him.

These questions are designed to encourage critical thinking, advanced research, and clear communication of ideas and perspectives. Here's an example of a grad-school level question in the field of cognitive psychology: \\"How do culture and context influence the cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and problem-solving, and what are the implications of these influences for education and intervention strategies?\\" This question has several components that require a nuanced understanding of cognitive psychology and its intersection with culture and context: 1. Identification of cognitive processes: The question specifically refers to attention, memory, and problem-solving as examples of cognitive processes. However, the student may also want to address other relevant processes, such as perception, language, and decision-making. 2. Exploration of cultural influences: The student must understand how the cultural background, beliefs, and practices of individuals or groups can shape cognitive processes. For example, research has shown that some cultures prioritize holistic thinking, while others emphasize analytical thinking. 3. Examination of contextual influences: It is important to recognize that cognitive processes can also be influenced by the immediate environment or context, such as the social setting, physical location, or time constraints. For example, a person's ability to focus attention may be affected by the presence of distracting stimuli or the amount of stress they are experiencing. 4. Assessment of educational implications: Given the cultural and contextual influences on cognitive processes, the student should discuss how these factors should be considered when designing educational programs, teaching strategies, or interventions to enhance learning. For instance, an understanding of cultural differences in cognition may help educators tailor their teaching methods to better accommodate the diverse needs of their students. 5. Consideration of intervention strategies: The student should also consider how insights from the study of culture and context may inform the design of interventions for individuals experiencing difficulties with cognitive processes. This might involve the development of culturally sensitive assessment tools, the adaptation of evidence-based interventions to a particular cultural context, or the implementation of strategies that leverage cultural strengths to support cognitive functioning. In answering this grad-school level question, the student is expected to synthesize various sources of literature, draw on empirical evidence, and offer a well-reasoned and comprehensive discussion that reflects the complexity of the topic."},{"question":"News article: Stocks stage a rebound as tech sector rallies A strong rally Tuesday lifted the market’s main indexes, in particular driving the tech-rich Nasdaq composite index up 2.4 percent.

Hypothesis: According to a Time piece, Levi Strauss lost a third of its customers to Diesel and Polo. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","response":"Step 1: Identify key information in both the premise and hypothesis. - Premise: Levi Strauss faces stiff competition from trendier competitors (Diesel, Tommy Hilfiger, Polo). - Hypothesis: According to a Time piece, Levi Strauss lost a third of its customers to Diesel and Polo. Step 2: Compare key information in both statements to see if there is a direct correlation. - Both statements mention Levi Strauss, Diesel, and Polo as relevant parties. - The premise mentions Levi Strauss facing stiff competition from said competitors. - The hypothesis mentions Levi Strauss losing a third of its customers specifically to Diesel and Polo, based on a Time piece. Step 3: Determine entailed status. - The premise does not provide any specific information about market share loss or customer count loss for Levi Strauss. - The hypothesis, on the other hand, provides a specific quantity (a third of its customers) as well as an explicit loss to only Diesel and Polo. It also cites a Time piece that is not mentioned in the premise. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as it provides specific information about Levi Strauss losing customers to Diesel and Polo that is not present in the premise, along with citing an external source.

Let Mel's weight be m. Brenda’s weight is 3 * m + 10 = 220 pounds. Thus 3m = 220 - 10 = 210 pounds. Therefore Mel's weight is m = 210 / 3 = 70 pounds. The answer: 70","response":"The question for this implicit rationale is: How much does Mel weigh if Brenda weighs 3 times as much as Mel plus 10 pounds, and Brenda weighs 220 pounds? Here's the justification for the answer: 1. We are given two pieces of information: Brenda weighs 3 times as much as Mel plus 10 pounds, and Brenda's weight is 220 pounds. 2. Let Mel's weight be represented by the variable m. 3. We express Brenda's weight in terms of Mel's weight: 3 * m + 10. 4. Since Brenda's weight is 220 pounds, we set the expression for Brenda's weight equal to 220: 3 * m + 10 = 220. 5. We solve for Mel's weight (m) by rearranging the equation: 3m = 220 - 10 -> 3m = 210 6. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get Mel's weight: m = 210 / 3 -> m = 70.

Available choices: (a). 0. (b). 1. (c). 2. (d). 3. (e). 4. (f). 5.","response":"To evaluate the similarity between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2, let's break down and analyze the meanings of each sentence. Sentence 1: If evidence is not provided to support a position; then it should be rejected. This sentence states that if there is no proper evidence available for supporting a particular stance or argument, it is recommended to dismiss or reject that stance. Sentence 2: If a position is unverifiable; then it should be rejected. This sentence suggests that if the validity of a position or argument cannot be confirmed or verified, rejecting this stance is advised. Now, let's consider the similarities and differences between the two sentences. Both sentences deal with the idea of dismissing or rejecting a position or argument under specific conditions. Sentence 1 focuses on the lack of supportive evidence as the primary reason for rejecting a position, while Sentence 2 emphasizes the unverifiable nature of a position as the reason for rejection. Although the two sentences are not identical in meaning, they share a core idea of rejecting a position based on insufficient rationale or substantiation. Taking this into account, the similarity between the two sentences can be rated as the following choice: (d). 3. The rating of 3 signifies that, while the sentences do not mean the same thing, they still share a meaningful overlap in theme and convey a similar concept."},{"question":"Answer the question...when do the 12 days of christmas begin??","response":"To answer the question about when the 12 days of Christmas begin, I will first gather information about the origins and traditions of the 12 days of Christmas.

Step 2: Narrow down the subject To focus the context and develop a hypothesis, I will narrow the subject down to air pollution and its effects on human health. Step 3: Generate a context The context should present a situation or problem related to the narrowed subject. Here it is: Context: In recent years, urban air pollution has become a significant concern for people living in densely populated cities around the world. It has been observed that pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ground-level ozone have risen consistently due to increasing traffic, industrial emissions, and other human activities. As a result, concerns have been raised on the potential impacts of urban air pollution on public health and the necessity to develop strategies to mitigate these effects. Step 4: Develop a hypothesis A hypothesis should be a proposed explanation or a prediction relating to the context, and it should be testable. Here it is: Hypothesis: Prolonged exposure to high levels of urban air pollution is positively correlated with an increase in the prevalence of respiratory diseases among city dwellers, and the implementation of stricter air quality regulations could lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of such illnesses."},{"question":"Q: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Removing floor tile can cause injuries if you’re not properly protected, so put on leather work gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, and pants to protect your hands, arms, and legs from getting cut.

Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie. In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie. I believe it gets old, and that is the case here. There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining. However, because De Niro is IN this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at his best, see \\"Midnight Run\\", \\"Goodfellas\\", or \\"Cop Land\\", or even go way back and check out \\"Taxi Driver\\" or \\"Godfather II\\".

Tool kit: A saw is a common tool for cutting wood or other materials. It is often part of a tool kit that includes various tools and equipment necessary for different types of tasks.

This option is also plausible. C. Tool shed: A tool shed is a small structure used to store garden tools and equipment. A saw might be kept in a tool shed if it's used primarily for outdoor woodworking tasks or for trimming branches. This option could be suitable too. D. Hardware store: A hardware store is a retail business that sells tools, equipment, and various materials for construction and home improvement projects. A saw might be for sale in a hardware store, but it's not a part of the store itself. This option is less appropriate. E. Bathroom: A bathroom is a room in a building for personal hygiene activities. A saw is not commonly found or used in a bathroom. This is not a fitting option. Based on these justifications, the best answer is A.

Spread melted butter in a pan and spread evenly across the pan. You may need to work quickly to incorporate this butter without sticking to the side of the pan.. B). Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in. You can use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening to grease the pan.. C). Using a butter knife, lightly grease your pan. If you do not have a butter knife, you can use your fingers, which are readily available on counter tops.. D). Use a butter knife to gently grease the pan using a circular motion as you grease it with butter. If you're using a pinch-of-salt, place the pinch of salt on the inside of the pan before you begin cooking..","response":"To prevent your cheesecake from cracking, take the time to ensure that the pan is greased properly. Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in, reducing the likelihood of the center cracking. You can use various methods to grease your pan effectively. One option is to spread melted butter in the pan, ensuring an even coat across the entire surface. Be mindful that you may need to work quickly so that the butter does not stick to the side of the pan. Another option is to use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening as your greasing agent. Each of these options will provide a lubricated surface for the cheesecake to release from after baking. No matter what you choose, be sure to coat the sides and bottom of the pan comprehensively to avoid any potential sticking. If using a butter knife to grease your pan, a light touch will suffice. If you don't have a butter knife at hand, you can also use your fingers to spread the grease evenly, as long as your hands are clean and the surface is well-covered. In case you're incorporating additional ingredients, such as a pinch of salt, place those on the inside of the pan before starting the cooking process. In summary, proper pan greasing is essential in preventing cheesecakes from cracking. Make sure to thoroughly apply your choice of grease (cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening) to the pan's sides and bottom. Addressing this issue will not only result in an aesthetically pleasing cheesecake but also one with a smooth and velvety texture, perfect for every special occasion or simple dessert craving."},{"question":"Given the question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I love it!!! 😊\\" The answer is:","response":"5"},{"question":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish . - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\"). - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

At all. \\"During pregnancy: no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; [and] all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk,\\" the study states. That's because, researchers explain in a press release, alcohol intake while pregnant can result in a wide array of problems from growth retardation to developmental delays and learning disabilities to problems with the brain, heart, bones and spine, kidneys, vision, or hearing.

In fact, there are any number of so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that are linked to drinking while pregnant, and any time a child experiences a delay or a behavioral disorder, she explains, an FASD could be to blame—but FASDs are more difficult to diagnose than FAS. The new study points out that more than three decades of research links alcohol intake while pregnant with birth defects, she says, far more than any evidence suggesting it's no big deal.

Some of the school's students had visited Cancun on a spring break trip two weeks ago. Officials reported 68 U.S. cases of swine flu in five states so far, with the latest in Ohio and New York. Unlike in Mexico, cases in the United State have been mild and U.S. health authorities can't yet explain why. In New York City, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that there were 45 cases, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. About 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School complained of flu-like symptoms; further tests will determine how many of those cases are swine flu. St. Francis is the largest private Catholic high school in the nation, with 2,700 students. The school canceled classes on Monday and Tuesday in response to the outbreak. Bloomberg stressed that the New York cases were mild and many are recovering, but said that some family members of students also had flu symptoms. In Mexico, health officials say a strain of swine flu has killed up to 160 people and sickened over 2,000. New York officials said the flu strain discovered in the patients here is the same strain as in Mexico, though all the New York cases are mild. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A flu viruses. Human cases are uncommon but can occur in people who are around pigs. It also can be spread from person to person.

Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we’ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our “would likes” and our “must haves.” That way, when we are house hunting, we’ll already know what we’re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you’re preparing a lot of food, you’re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well.

Translate to English","response":"In the year 2007, a total of 58 million passenger cars were sold worldwide, and the production capacities amounted to 72 million. This sentence, originally in German, refers to the sales and production capacities of passenger cars in the global market during the year 2007. The given information highlights two aspects: the number of vehicles sold and the capacities for production. The number of passenger cars sold in 2007 (58 million) demonstrates a significant demand for automobiles in the global market. The term \\"passenger cars\\" usually refers to vehicles designed for transporting passengers and their belongings, typically having four wheels, an enclosed cabin, and an engine located at the front. The worldwide sales figure suggests that these types of vehicles were popular and widely sought-after during that particular year. On the other hand, the production capacities were mentioned to be 72 million. This number, larger than the number of cars sold, indicates that the global automotive industry had a surplus in terms of production capabilities. In other words, they were able to produce more vehicles than the actual demand required. This surplus of production capacities can be attributed to a variety of factors, including advancements in technology, manufacturing efficiencies, and increased investments in the automotive sector. Additionally, the year 2007 was right before the global financial crisis, which severely impacted the automotive industry. However, during this pre-crisis period, the automotive sector was performing relatively well. The strong sales figure highlights the stable market condition for passenger cars prior to the downturn. In conclusion, it can be deduced that in 2007, there was a relatively healthy demand for passenger cars, with 58 million being sold worldwide. The production capacities in this sector were also robust, amounting to 72 million.

Discovered in 1899 by Friedrich Oskar Giesel, Actinium is a radioactive metal that is silvery-white in appearance and is part of the actinide series of elements. Actinium earned its name from the Greek word \\"aktinos,\\" which means \\"ray\\" or \\"beam,\\" as a nod to its radioactive properties. It is an extremely scarce element, and its natural occurrence in the Earth's crust is due to traces resulting from the decay of uranium and thorium. This rarity means it has minimal commercial applications. Despite this scarcity, Actinium plays an essential role in important scientific applications. Most notably, this element serves as a neutron source in nuclear reactors due to its emission of a high number of neutrons per second when it is bombarded with alpha particles. Another vital use of Actinium is in targeted cancer therapy, where it is employed as a radioactive isotope, Actinium-225, in alpha particle-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. These radiopharmaceuticals target cancer cells with precision, sparing healthy tissues from radiation and thus minimizing damage to noncancerous cells. Actinium, like other actinide elements, mostly exists in an oxidation state of +3. It forms a layer of actinide oxide (Ac2O3) when exposed to air. It also reacts with water, making it challenging to store and handle. Its radioactive nature presents further challenges and requires strict protective measures during any experimentation or use. In summary, Actinium (element number 89) is the first element alphabetically in a list of naturally occurring elements. It is a silvery-white and highly radioactive metal that is found in trace amounts in the Earth's crust. Its significance largely lies in its scientific applications, such as its role as a neutron source in nuclear reactors and its use in targeted cancer therapy."},{"question":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A baseball player in a red jersey throwing a ball at the pitchers mound.\\", can we conclude \\"The baseball player was watching tv\\"?

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering whether a young child should be exposed to graphic and explicit content in movies, numerous factors come into play. On the one hand, developmental psychologists emphasize the crucial role of experiences and external stimuli in shaping a child's growing mind. As children absorb information from their surroundings, including the media they consume, they start to build their understanding of the world. On the other hand, an individual's emotional and cognitive development, in part, depends on age-appropriate exposure to content. During their early years, children's brains are generally unprepared to process intense, violent, and explicit imagery. Exposing them to such material could result in confusion, fear, and even evidence of psychological distress. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children below the age of six are not capable of distinguishing fantasy from reality. Consequently, they may internalize fears and misconceptions prompted by graphic content, generating potential long-term psychological effects. Furthermore, young children are highly impressionable, so the values and behaviors depicted in R-rated movies may lead to the adoption of negative behaviors and attitudes. Exposure to violent content has been linked to aggressive behavior in children or, at the very least, a desensitization to real-life violence. In addition to violent scenes, R-rated movies may contain explicit sexual content, which could introduce children to inappropriate sexual conduct. Such exposure might be confusing and distressing for a child who is yet to grasp the dynamics and nuances of healthy relationships and consensual sexual activity. Taking these factors into account, it is evident that exposing a 5-year-old to the graphic and explicit content in an R-rated movie could adversely impact the child's emotional, cognitive, and behavioral development. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Is it safe for 5-year-olds to watch graphic, R-rated movies containing extreme violence and explicit content?\\" is no."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Clockstoppers Movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in.

D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham identified the suspect as Anthony Crawford, 23, of Northwest, who has been charged with first-degree murder while armed. “We don’t have a motive,” Newsham said at a Thursday news conference. He also said that Crawford did not cooperate with police, has a criminal history and that investigators are still combing through it. They will look into whether or not Crawford has any mental health issues. “We feel very confident that we have in our custody the person responsible for this murder,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said.

Wendy Martinez, 35, was fatally stabbed while running shortly before 8 p.m. at 11th and P streets NW. “It’s unsettling for anyone who lives in this city to see this happen. It’s an isolated incident.

This is a woman who should have been going to work today,” she said. Bowser called the stabbing “damaging to our senses of safety.” Martinez’s family says she was recently engaged.

It's impossible to say; [C]. No;","response":"B. It's impossible to say; To look like Whitney Port from \\"The Hills,\\" there are several aspects of her appearance and style that you can incorporate into your own. Keep in mind that imitating someone's appearance should be done in a way that still celebrates your uniqueness and personal style preferences. Here are some steps to achieving a look similar to Whitney Port: 1. Hair: Whitney Port is known for her long, beachy blonde hair with platinum highlights. If your hair is not naturally blonde, you can consider dyeing it to a similar shade and adding highlights for a sun-kissed look. If your hair is shorter, try growing it out or using hair extensions to achieve the desired length. To get her signature beachy waves, use a wide-barrel curling iron or sea salt spray and scrunch your hair. 2. Makeup: Whitney often sports a natural, dewy makeup look. To achieve this, focus on using a lightweight foundation or tinted moisturizer that provides an even coverage. Use a soft champagne or bronze eyeshadow on the eyelids and add a subtle winged eyeliner for a touch of definition. Complete the eye makeup with a coat or two of mascara. For the cheeks, use a warm peach or pink blush, and finish the look with a nude or soft pink lip color. 3. Clothing: Whitney's style on \\"The Hills\\" was a mix of trendy, casual, and chic clothing items. Invest in some classic pieces, such as well-fitting jeans, a variety of tops, and tailored blazers or jackets. Also, incorporate trendy pieces like off-the-shoulder tops, boho-style dresses, and skirts. Remember to pick items that suit your body type and personal style, while still drawing inspiration from Whitney's look. 4. Accessories: Accessorize your outfits with statement pieces like bold necklaces, chunky bracelets, and large sunglasses. Whitney also often wears oversized handbags in neutral colors. Choose accessories that complement your outfits and add a touch of glamour. 5. Confidence: Perhaps the most essential element of achieving Whitney Port's look is to carry yourself with confidence. Stand tall, embrace your unique qualities, and wear your outfits with pride. Confidence can make any look more refined and closely resemble the persona of Whitney from \\"The Hills.\\" In response to the question about the agent being 35, it is impossible to say.

The infant smiled more when offered breastmilk than formula because the Pick your answer from: I. breastmilk made them sick.; II. formula made them sick.;","response":"II. formula made them sick. Step by step reasoning: 1. The infant smiled more when offered breastmilk than formula. This implies that the baby prefers breastmilk over formula for some reason. 2. We are given two options about what could be causing this preference: either the breastmilk made them sick, or the formula made them sick. 3. If the breastmilk made them sick, it would be more likely for the baby to show a preference for the formula, not the breastmilk. Therefore, this option does not align with the information given. 4. Thus, we are left with the option that the formula made them sick. In this case, it makes sense for the baby to prefer breastmilk over formula, as it would be a more comfortable, better-feeling option for them.

On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he bakes apple pies. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he bakes cherry pies. If he bakes 12 pies per day, how many more apple pies does he bake than cherry pies in one week? Your thoughts:","response":"Steve bakes apple pies on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which equals 3 days per week. He bakes 12 apple pies per day, so during those 3 days, he bakes a total of 12 pies/day * 3 days = 36 apple pies. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Steve bakes cherry pies, which totals 2 days per week. He also bakes 12 cherry pies per day. So, during those 2 days, he bakes a total of 12 pies/day * 2 days = 24 cherry pies. Now, we find the difference between the number of apple pies and cherry pies he bakes in one week. Difference = Apple pies - Cherry pies Difference = 36 pies - 24 pies Difference = 12 pies So, Steve bakes 12 more apple pies than cherry pies in one week."},{"question":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \\"vaccine\\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing... My question: Who is the only SWORD agent to evade capture?

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. a few weeks B. not enough information C. one night D. several months to a couple of years Answer:","response":"B. not enough information Based on the information provided, there is not enough detail to determine the duration of the affair, if it indeed occurred, between President Trump and the adult film star."},{"question":"Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere. After reading the above, is \\"First significant contribution to philosophy\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How does Camus view the absurd?\\"? Possible answers: (1). no. (2). yes.","response":"(1). no. Camus's view of the absurd is not explicitly detailed in the passage as his \\"First significant contribution to philosophy.\\" Rather, it is mentioned that his thought on the absurd revolves around the idea that the absurd arises from \\"our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither.\\" This idea is emphasized in his works such as The Myth of Sisyphus, The Stranger, and The Plague. While it is true that Camus's concept of the absurd was a significant contribution to philosophy, the passage doesn't directly answer how Camus views the absurd, but instead discusses its place in his works and philosophy."},{"question":"Please add punctuation to this: July 1 through September 15 2016","response":"July 1, through September 15, 2016."},{"question":"- instrument is bass guitar , guitar , keyboards , vocals - genre is progressive metalcore , death metal , technical death metal , deathcore metal , thrash metal , experimental rock , progressive rock , jazz fusion , - birth date is september 27 , 1984 - background is non_vocal_instrumentalist - associated acts is between the buried and me , orbs , trioscapes Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Context: Woodes Rogers (\\"ca.\\" 1679 – 15 July 1732) was an English sea captain and privateer and, later, the first Royal Governor of the Bahamas. He is known as the captain of the vessel that rescued marooned Alexander Selkirk, whose plight is generally believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe\\". Hypothesis: Woodes Rogers passed away in the summer of 1732. Pick your answer from: (a). Yes; (b). It's impossible to say; (c). No;","response":"(a). Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Woodes Rogers passed away in the summer of 1732 from the provided context. The context states that he died on 15th July 1732. In the Northern Hemisphere, which includes England where Rogers was from, July is considered to be within the summer season. Thus, it can be inferred that Woodes Rogers died in the summer of 1732. In addition to his death date, the context provides some of his prominent roles and achievements. As an English sea captain, privateer, and the first Royal Governor of the Bahamas, his significance extends beyond his maritime endeavors. His rescue of the marooned Alexander Selkirk is particularly notable as it is believed to have served as inspiration for \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" a seminal piece of Western literature penned by Daniel Defoe. So, the context offers both pertinent biographical details as well as more cultural and historical insight into Woodes Rogers' life and impact, one of which is the confirmed fact that he died on 15th July 1732, which falls within summer."},{"question":"News article: A Flickering 'Torch Song Trilogy' in London Long before America cuddled up with those wholesome gay pixies on “Will and Grace” and “Modern Family,” there was “Torch Song Trilogy,” a play that scratched the surface of a fierce drag queen to discover a lovable Jewish mother with good family values beneath. Arnold was this comforting creature’s reassuringly plain name. The man who created him on the page and the stage, Harvey Fierstein, won Tony Awards for both Best Play and Best Actor in 1983, giving daring and triumphant new breadth to the notion of theater queen. Now Arnold is back in London, a town he first visited in 1985 (when he was portrayed to huzzahs by Antony Sher). And though it may ungallant to say it about a sometime lady, 30 years on Arnold is showing his age. He seems thinner, too, and not just because David Bedella, the accomplished actor playing him at the Menier Chocolate Factory, is many dress sizes smaller than Mr. Fierstein was or because of cuts made to the original, elephantine text. With the shock waves he once set off stilled by the passage of time, Arnold now looks like surprisingly close kin to a couple of other characters who have invaded London in a revival this season: the wise-cracking vaudevillians of Neil Simon’s “Sunshine Boys.” The Menier Chocolate Factory, a hit-spawning napkin-sized theater in Southwark, is undeniably an appropriate place for the resuscitation of “Torch Song,” which runs through August. It was here that “La Cage Aux Folles,” the musical by Mr. Fierstein and Jerry Herman about another maternal female impersonator, was revived (and truly rejuvenated) in 2007. It went on to pick up most awards on offer in the West End and on Broadway, including a Tony for Best Actor for its cross-dressed leading man, Douglas Hodge. Mr. Hodge is the director of the current “Torch Song.” He has staged this production with an ingratiating, crowd-courting sweetness – a trait that was evident in, but only a part of, his barnstorming performance in “La Cage.” His “Trilogy” starts off bubbly – with Mr. Bedella’s Arnold confiding in us in the manner of the title character of “Shirley Valentine” (another Menier hit) – and it proceeds to percolate for nearly three hours. This is true even in scenes of angst-ridden confession and confrontation that touch on enduring hot-button issues like gay bashing, gay marriage and gay adoption. Outsize, neurotic Jewish characters who wisecracked through their tears were hardly new to Broadway when “Torch Song” opened there. Neil Simon had made a fortune from them. But none of these folks, to my knowledge, had been openly and unapologetically gay, or hung out in the backrooms of gay bars. That novelty made the mainstream embrace of “Torch Song” an important cultural milestone. There was also no denying the startling, high-voltage appeal of Mr. Fierstein, whom I first saw as a teenager Off Off Broadway, when he was playing the heroine of a raunchy romp called “Flatbush Tosca.” Even without singing, this foghorn-voiced, plus-size actor had musical-comedy star shine, the kind of lovable grotesqueness associated with the likes of Ethel Merman, Carol Channing and Zero Mostel. Mr. Fierstein may have tailor-made Arnold for himself, but he was such an overwhelmingly emotional presence that he burst the seams of the part. In full rant, his Arnold brought to mind accounts of legendary performances of Yiddish theater on the Lower East Side, where the audience wept and sweated buckets along with the actors. Mr. Bedella, who won an Olivier Award playing the Devil in “Jerry Springer: The Opera,” works hard at emulating Mr. Fierstein’s basso profundo, New Yawk accent and killer comic timing. He is, as he should be, the best reason to see this show. But he’s a precise and compact performer. And for “Torch Song” to have impact, it needs to be kind of a mess, to sprawl with a sense of big, untidy feelings let loose on a stage. Mr. Hodge’s production, attractively designed by the seriously talented Soutra Gilmour (“The Duchess of Malfi”), exudes a picturesque nostalgia for crazy Olde New York, where people went to discos and group therapy. And the cast members – who include Joe McFadden and Tom Harries as two of Arnold’s lovers and Sara Kestelman as his devoted but disapproving mother — often deliver their zingers with an exaggerated sprightliness that suggests what long-forgotten racy 1970s musicals like “I Love My Wife” must have been like. (Their American accents only enhance the sense of artificiality.) Arnold, though a creature of that era, connects with another kind of past, when divas with songs in their hearts and lumps in their throats ruled the screen and the radio. This sensibility is underscored by having the cast members wistfully sing standards like “My Funny Valentine” and “The Man That Got Away” between scenes. They could well have included “I’m Old Fashioned,” too. And why not “Isn’t It Romantic?” Even the group-groping backroom bars here registers as touchingly innocent, summoning a pre-AIDS, pre-Internet moment in gay culture when hook-ups were made in person, condoms had yet to become a life-saving necessity and outrageous guys like Arnold were not yet shrunken to prime-time proportions. What are the most important parts of this news article?","response":"This news article is about a play called \\"Torch Song Trilogy\\" in London. The play is about a character named Arnold, who is a drag queen with good family values. The play was first performed in 1983 and was very popular because it showed an openly gay character in a positive light. Now, the play has been brought back to London, and the article talks about how the play and its characters have changed over time. The most important parts are that the play is being performed in London at a theater called the Menier Chocolate Factory, it discusses the history of the play and its impact on gay culture, and it mentions the director and main actor of this new production."},{"question":"Information: - The American Marketing Association (AMA) is a professional association for marketing professionals with 30,000 members as of 2012.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Subtle Knife, the second book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series, is a young-adult fantasy novel written by Philip Pullman and published in 1997.

Jack Hansen-Bartel, 21, was at court on Friday for the first day of a hearing against two Asian-American students accused of the attack on June 10 last year. Mr Hansen-Bartel was required to undergo several operations to treat facial injuries after the attack on the resort island of Samui. The attackers were identified by witnesses as two Asian-American students visiting from an international school in China. Police quickly arrested the students as Mr Hansen-Bartel was taken to hospital, but the pair, both from wealthy families, have reportedly attempted to influence the case. Thailand's Office of the Ombudsman launched an investigation, resulting in the replacement of the public prosecutor overseeing the case amid allegations of irregularities. The two American men and their families were at the Samui Court on Friday to hear charges of serious assault on Mr Hansen-Bartel, but the hearing was postponed and Mr Hansen-Bartel was taken into custody in response to charges filed earlier this year by lawyers representing the two Americans. The lawyers had Mr Hansen-Bartel charged with assaulting the two students without causing them any physical or psychological harm and of disturbing the peace. Mr Hansen-Bartel's mother, Annie Hansen-Bartel, originally from Melbourne, says her son was traumatised after being thrown into cells with hardened criminals. \\"It's really difficult,\\" she told AAP. \\"Jack's a really gentle soul and when I see police ... twisting his arm up his back and throwing him on the floor it's not good.\\" Mr Hansen-Bartel's Melbourne-based brother, Jesse, in a Facebook posting called the jailing of his brother \\"a ploy clearly tactical in nature designed to detract from the severity of the charges against (the Americans)\\". Mr Hansen-Bartel was later released after posting 5000 baht (A200) bail. The American families are reported to have offered an out-of-court settlement but this was rejected by Mr Hansen-Bartel's lawyers. Ms Hansen-Bartel has said the attack on her son was unprovoked and had left the family facing medical and legal bills of more than 180,000. Do you have any news photos or videos?

Article: Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Question: If one of your baby teeth falls out, you_. Options: A: should have a false tooth fixed in its place B: have to put it under your pillow at once C: will gain a permanent tooth in future D: can exchange it for some money","response":"To find the correct answer, let us examine the article and identify the statement that is related to baby teeth falling out: \\"Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning.

Solve this problem.","response":"To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable 'k'. Let's do this step by step: Initial equation: -890*k = -1060*k - 5950 The first thing we need to do is to get all the k terms on one side of the equation. We can easily do this by adding 1060*k to both sides of the equation. This neutralizes the -1060*k on the right side and gives us a new equation: (-890*k) + (1060*k) = -1060*k - 5950 + 1060*k Which simplifies to: 170*k = -5950 We then want to isolate 'k', which is our variable. We can do this by dividing each side of the equation by 170: (170*k) / 170 = -5950 / 170 Which simplifies to: k = -35 So, the solution to the equation -890*k = -1060*k - 5950 is k = -35."},{"question":"Write the next sentence.

A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not... Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'inception' with '1999'.

Zetia and Vytorin are heavily prescribed despite a lack of proof the cholesterol drugs help to prolong life or prevent heart attacks. Schering-Plough says Food and Drug Administration has rejected Bridion, its drug to reverse effects of anesthesia that had been heralded as breakthrough product by analysts and was unanimously recommended by federal advisory panel The cholesterol-lowering drug Vytorin did not help people with heart-valve disease avoid further heart problems but did appear to increase their risk of cancer, scientists reported Monday. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether four drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system diseases might increase risk of cancer in children; says it has received reports of 30 cases of cancer over 10 years among children and young adults treated with those drugs; drugs involved are Enbrel, sold by Amgen and Wyeth, Remicade, sold by Johnson & Johnson and, in Europe, by Schering-Plough, Humira, sold by Abbott Laboratories and Cimzia, which is sold by UBC; photo House Democrats are questioning whether Merck and Schering-Plough made up information about a meeting of medical specialists to discuss Vytorin, after lawmakers began investigating a failed study of the drug.

The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings. - Sly and the Family Stone was an American band from San Francisco. Active from 1966 to 1983, the band was pivotal in the development of funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic music. The group's core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and featured Stone's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Gregg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. The band was the first major American rock group to have an \\"integrated, multi-gender\\" lineup. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Sly Stone (born Sylvester Stewart, March 15, 1943, Denton, Texas) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for Sly and the Family Stone, a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, funk, rock, and psychedelia in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group. - The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Larry Graham, Jr. (born August 14, 1946) is an American bass guitar player, both with the psychedelic soul/funk band Sly and the Family Stone, and as the founder and frontman of Graham Central Station. He is credited with the invention of the slapping technique, which radically expanded the tonal palette of the bass, although he himself refers to the technique as \\"thumpin' and pluckin'\\". - Cynthia Robinson (January 12, 1944 November 23, 2015) was an American musician, best known for being the trumpeter and vocalist in Sly and the Family Stone. Her voice and presence were featured in the hit \\"Dance To The Music\\". - Stevland Hardaway Morris (born Stevland Hardaway Judkins; May 13, 1950), known by his stage name Stevie Wonder, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. A child prodigy, he is considered to be one of the most critically and commercially successful musical performers of the late 20th century. Wonder signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, and he continued performing and recording for Motown into the 2010s. He has been blind since shortly after birth. - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated. - A chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of musical chords. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in Western musical tradition. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Rose \`\` Rosie '' Stone ( born Rosemary Stewart ; March 21 , 1945 ) is an African - American singer and keyboardist . She is best known as one of the lead singers in Sly and the Family Stone , a popular psychedelic soul / funk band founded by her brothers , Sly Stone and Freddie Stone .

Stone appears briefly in a deleted scene \`\` Judith 's Youth '' on the DVD of the movie 20 Feet from Stardom . - Jerry Martini (born October 1, 1943) is an American musician, best known for being the saxophonist for Sly and the Family Stone. - Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan. - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - The 5th Dimension is an American popular music vocal group, whose repertoire includes pop, R&B, soul, jazz, light opera and Broadwaythe melange was coined as \\"Champagne Soul.\\" - The Chambers Brothers are an American soul band, best known for its eleven-minute long 1968 hit \\"Time Has Come Today\\". The group was part of the wave of new music that integrated American blues and gospel traditions with modern psychedelic and rock elements. Their music has been kept alive through heavy use in film soundtracks. - Vet Stone (born Vaetta Stewart; May 2, 1950, Vallejo, California) is an African-American soul singer. - In music, extended chords are tertian chords (built from thirds) or triads with notes \\"extended\\", or added, beyond the seventh. Ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords are extended chords. The thirteenth is the farthest extension diatonically possible as, by that point, all seven tonal degrees are represented within the chord. In practice however, extended chords do not typically use all the chord members; when it is not altered, the fifth is often omitted, as are notes between the seventh and the highest note (i.e., the ninth is often omitted in an eleventh chord; the ninth and eleventh are usually omitted in a thirteenth chord), unless they are altered to give a special texture. See chord alteration. - The Supremes were an American female singing group and the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, HollandDozierHolland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. - A melody (\\"singing, chanting\\"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A keyboardist is a musician who plays keyboard instruments. Until the early 1960s musicians who played keyboards were generally classified as either pianists or organists. Since the mid-1960s, a plethora of new musical instruments with keyboards have come into common usage, requiring a more general term for a person who plays them. These keyboards include: - Freddie Stone (born Frederick Stewart, June 5, 1947, Vallejo, California, United States) is an African-American pastor and musician, best known for his role as co-founder, guitarist, and vocalist in the band Sly and the Family Stone, the frontman for which was his brother Sly Stone. His sisters Rosie Stone and Vet Stone were also members of the band. - Funkadelic is an American band that was most prominent during the 1970s. The band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the funk music culture of that decade. - Psychedelia is a name given to the subculture of people, originating in the 1960s, who often use psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline and peyote. The term is also used to describe a style of psychedelic artwork and psychedelic music. Psychedelic art and music typically try to recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted and surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke and convey to a viewer or listener the artist's experience while using such drugs, or to enhance the experience of a user of these drugs. Psychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar, electronic effects, sound effects and reverberation, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another. The term \\"psychedelic\\" is derived from the Ancient Greek words \\"psych\\" (, \\"soul\\") and \\"dloun\\" (, \\"to make visible, to reveal\\"), translating to \\"soul-revealing\\". - Bebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Denton is a city in and the county seat of Denton County, Texas. As of the 2010 United States Census, its population was 113,383, making it the 27th most populous city in Texas and the 11th-largest city in the DallasFort Worth metroplex. - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Does Stacie wish to keep the home after Laurel's death, or sell it? Movie plot title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners. According to Siegal, all New Jersey counties can choose whether or not to allow their employees to pass on benefits to their partners.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Shine\\" is a reggae pop and ska song that lasts three minutes and 24 seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \\"Pharrell's 'Happy\\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \\"without sounding overly patronizing\\". \\"Shine\\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics.

The authorities confiscated his passport in June when he tried to fly to Germany, during the president's visit there, to discuss human rights. He got off lightly, he says, by only getting a travel ban. Other leading activists here won't be following the visit because they are in jail - among them icons of the 2011 revolution. \\"We have never had such a dismal situation for human rights,\\" says the renowned Egyptian author and activist Ahdaf Soueif. \\"It's the worst it's ever been.\\" Her nephew, Alaa Abdel Fattah, is one of the key figures from the uprising who are now behind bars. The prominent blogger and pro-democracy activist has just marked one year in jail, and is due to serve four more, for attending an illegal demonstration. Ms Soueif - who is a citizen of Egypt and the UK - says that by hosting President Sisi, Britain will strengthen an authoritarian regime. \\"I think it definitely sends the wrong message,\\" she says, \\"because the regime needs acceptance, and if it has acceptance when it's disappearing people from the streets, and giving people ridiculous jail sentences and allowing people to die in prison for lack of medical attention - then it's definitely the wrong message.\\" The previous Egyptian President, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, was also invited to the UK, but was ousted before he could make the trip. Mr Sisi, then armed forces chief, removed him in 2013, after massive public protests, in what many regard as a coup. Now he and most of those who would have accompanied him are behind bars. Morsi - who was Egypt's first democratically elected president - is a one of hundreds of Islamists sentenced to death in summary mass trials. That is part of a brutal campaign to crush dissent in which more than 1,000 protestors, mostly Islamists, have been killed on the streets. As many as 40,000 people are estimated to have been detained in recent years. The US-based Human Rights Watch describes the crackdown as \\"ferocious\\". Egyptian officials - in Cairo and London - deny that the Arab world's most populous nation has returned to the repression of the past. Nasser Kamel, Ambassador to the UK, accused human rights groups of siding with the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. \\"We know where those campaigns are coming from,\\" said Mr Kamel, \\"and we know they are politically tainted, in a way reflecting a point of view of a certain group, or view, of the Brotherhood in Egypt. \\"Egypt is a state of law, has been applying the law, respecting the law.\\" The ambassador prefers to emphasise the common ground between the two countries. \\"We are partners in the war against Isil [so-called Islamic State],\\" he told the BBC, \\"we are partners in the war against terrorism at large. \\"Egypt and UK are talking closely to each other concerning so many issues like the crisis in Libya and the situation in Syria.\\" Egypt presents itself as a beacon of stability in a volatile region. And it has another selling point - it is an attractive market for British businesses. In Cairo shopping centres there are big name British brands - from Topshop to Debenhams and Marks and Spencer. But the UK's interests extend beyond retail - to oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and construction. Britain has a great deal at stake here. It is the biggest foreign investor in Egypt. The opportunities are expanding with the nation, according to Cairo-based investment consultant Angus Blair, of the Signet Institute. In the next 15 years, Egypt's population of 90 million is expected to swell to around 120 million. \\"That will be a major drain on the government,\\" Mr Blair said, \\"but it will also provide enormous opportunities for investors because the consumer sector is growing. \\"There's a lot of money around in supermarkets and shopping malls. People are looking to spend.\\" So when the prime minister sits down with the Egyptian leader, they will have plenty to discuss - from business interests to conflict in the Middle East. Downing Street says the stronger the working relationship, the more there can \\"be necessary and frank discussions on areas of disagreement\\".

The Ava Kingdom, the principal power in Upper Burma in the 14th and 15th centuries, had been fighting a long losing war against an alliance of its former vassal states: the Confederation of Shan States and Prome . Another former vassal state Toungoo , hemmed in by the Bago Yoma range in the west and the Shan Hills in the east, stayed out of the internecine warfare raging in Upper Burma.

Steve Robson. PUBLISHED:. 04:51 EST, 10 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:32 EST, 10 January 2013. Cryptic: Lance Armstrong has reportedly met with the US Anti-doping Agency to discuss 'a pathway to redemption' Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has. met with the US Anti-Doping Agency to discuss 'a pathway to redemption' following a report which cost him his seven Tour de France titles, it. has emerged. The head of the drugs authority Travis Tygart made the cryptic claim at the end of an interview with '60 Minutes Sport' last night. There was no further detail as to what this might mean or when and where a meeting was held. Speculation is rife that the shamed former cycling champion is ready to confess publicly that he consistently cheated throughout his career - having vehemently denied the accusation for years. Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'. Tygart said the cyclist's refusal to help in the probe was 'one of the lowest days of this investigation, quite honestly.' 'We were disappointed he didn't come in and be part of the solution,' he added. The New York Times reported last week. that Armstrong and Tygart had been meeting about a possible confession. Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied the meetings had taken place. He is due to give a no-holds-barred. interview with Oprah Winfrey next week. A special 90-minute episode of. 'Oprah's Next Chapter' will air on January 17 on Winfrey's OWN network. and it is widely expected Armstrong, 41, will give an emotional account. of the alleged doping scandal and use of performance enhancing drugs. that has ruined his once glittering career. It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2am UK time. 1992: Turned professional with Motorola Cycling Team and won his first race a year later. 1996: Diagnosed with testicular cancer aged 25. Beats the disease despite it spreading to his lungs, abdomen and brain and doctors giving him a less than 40 per cent chance of survival. 1998: Signs for US Postal team on salary of 200,000 a year. 1999: Wins first Tour de France. 2005: Retires after winning his seventh Tour de France. 2011: After several comebacks with mixed success, announces his retirement 'for good' 2012: After a two year investigation, US federal prosecutors dropped a doping investigation into Armstrong without filing any charges. June 2012: The US Anti-Doping Agency accuses Armstrong of 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'. January 17, 2013: Armstrong to appear on Oprah amid speculation that he will confess all. Bookmakers have been taking bets on which words Armstrong will use in the interview, with Ladbrookes offering 1/4 for 'sorry', evens for 'confess' and 'innocent' and 1/4 for 'apologise'. They were offering 8/11 that he will burst into tears. If Armstrong were to confess, there could be legal consequences, involving past and present civil cases and possibly perjury. Claim: CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency Travis Tygart said earlier this week that Armstrong offered the agency a 150,000 donation in 2004. The star's attorney denied the claim. Allegations: Travis Tygart said Armstrong had offered the drugs authority a donation of at least 150,000 during an interview with CBS 60 Minutes Sport. Anticipation: Lance Armstrong is due to appear on Oprah next week, he has spoken to the popular chat show host several times including in 2005. He has testified under oath. that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could. theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star. Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to. investigators about her drug use. Tainted success: Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after the report by the US Anti-Doping Agency. In addition to having his seven Tour de France titles stripped, Armstrong was banned for life from competing, which makes him ineligible for triathlons and other events sanctioned by USADA or the World Anti-Doping Agency. In the interview, Tygart said a representative of Armstrong's approached USADA in 2004 with an offer of a donation of more than 150,000. Asked if it felt like he was being. bought off, Tygart responded: 'It was a clear conflict of interest for. USADA and we had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' 'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA,' Tygart said. 'We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' Herman denied such an offer was made. 'No. truth to that story,' Herman wrote Tuesday in an email to the AP. 'First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution. or suggestion.' Tygart also said he had been subject to numerous death threats from anonymous emails and letters. 'The worst was probably putting a bullet in my head,' Tygart said when asked to recall specific details of the letter. He said the threatening letters were turned over to the FBI. Tygart also discussed the pressure he. felt while pursuing the investigation, even after federal officials. decided to shut down their probe. Last. year, two members of Congress called for stronger oversight of USADA,. which receives more than half its 15 million annual budget from the. government. Fall from grace: Armstrong has been accused of running a 'sophisticated' doping programme throughout his cycling career. 'We're always concerned about the grant we get from the federal government,' Tygart said. 'If we're unwilling to take this case and help this sport move forward, that we're here for naught. We should shut down. And if they want to shut us down for doing our job on behalf of clean athletes, and the integrity of competition, then shut us down.' Armstrong lost most of his personal. sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its. report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity. he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported 100 million. What are highlight points for this article?","response":"This article is about the cyclist Lance Armstrong and the doping scandal that took away his seven Tour de France titles. Here are some important things you might want to remember: 1. Lance Armstrong reportedly met with the US Anti-Doping Agency to talk about a 'pathway to redemption' or how he can make things right again. Kinda like when you have to apologize and make up for something wrong you did. 2. Lots of people think that Lance Armstrong might finally admit, or say yes, that he cheated during his cycling career. Even though he has always said no, he didn't, before. 3. Armstrong was accused of running the most clever, and successful doping program in sports. Doping is like when someone takes special medicines to make them play better in sports, but it's not allowed. 4. Armstrong has a chat scheduled with Oprah Winfrey where everyone thinks he'll talk about the whole doping scandal. It's a big deal because he used to be so famous and admired for his victories. 5. If Armstrong does admit he cheated, there could be trouble with the law too. 6. There's a claim that Armstrong once offered a large amount of money like, a donation, to the US Anti Doping Agency, which they rejected. 7. Armstrong has been banned forever from competing in races, so he can't do triathlons or other races managed by the USADA or the World Anti-Doping Agency. 8. As a result of this doping scandal, Armstrong lost a lot of his sponsorships and had to leave the board of the cancer charity he started. I hope that helps you! Remember, cheating is never a good thing to do."},{"question":"Well, I finally saw it. I didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying. I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I'll never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting. And that's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special. Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes. Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas is (The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). *****SPOILERS AHEAD******** The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome. First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the \\"chosen one\\". Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake. Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history--the great tragedy of Darth Vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end. How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the \\"dark one to be\\" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality. Well, of course he does. Sheesh. How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of \\"she's lost the will to live\\". Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with. But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO's mind is wiped, but not R2's--why????) stating \\"I think these droids belong to you\\", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be \\"the chosen one\\" and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says \\"strange, I don't recall owning any droids\\". Oh good grief. Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars. It's an afterthought, and it looks it. I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever.

His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958), often considered his best, is the most widely read book in modern African literature. He won the Man Booker International Prize in 2007. Raised by his parents in the Igbo town of Ogidi in southeastern Nigeria, Achebe excelled at school and won a scholarship to study medicine, but changed his studies to English literature at University College (now the University of Ibadan). Context: Once he returned to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition. In 1962 he attended an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. He met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, and US poet-author Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not \\"a very significant question\\", and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond. While at Makerere, Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student (James Ngugi, later known as Ngugi wa Thiong'o) called Weep Not, Child. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers \\"regarded West Africa only as a place where you sold books.\\" Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the African Writers Series, which became a significant force in bringing postcolonial literature from Africa to the rest of the world, and he continued in that role until 1972. As these works became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature - especially from Europe - began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: \\"no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view).\\" In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay \\"The Novelist as Teacher\\". Question: What else did they discuss?. Whats the answer?","response":"At the executive conference of African writers in English at Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda, several salient topics were brought up for discussion. One key issue revolved around the categorization of African literature - specifically, if works from the diaspora should be included in this category or if it should be limited to only those writings composed by individuals living within the continent of Africa. This important theme explored the concepts of identity, origin, and shared experiences in the definition of African literature. Chinua Achebe, himself a central figure in this conversation, downplayed the significance of this question to some extent. He posited that this query might not be \\"a very significant question\\" since it could potentially result in exclusionary practices or create a hierarchy of works based on geography rather than content or quality. Achebe suggested that scholars would do better to wait until a larger body of work had been established that could be more accurately and comprehensively assessed. The discussions at the conference were centered not just on the definition or boundaries of African literature, but also on the fostering of a sense of community and shared vision among African writers. Achebe underscored the importance of unity among isolated voices on the African continent and beyond, calling for collective action and understanding amongst writers scattered around the globe. This also served as an acknowledgment of the value of solidarity and connectivity in enriching and promoting African literature globally. Achebe was also asked to critique a new novel by a student, James Ngugi (later known as Ngugi wa Thiong'o). The book entitled \\"Weep Not, Child\\" impressed Achebe so much that he forwarded it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, leading to its publication two years later. This event underscores the conference discussions' impact on practical aspects of literature - such as publishing and promotion - not just the theoretical or philosophical aspects of African literature. Lastly, Achebe's role in the subsequent years as the General Editor of the African Writers Series is significant. This series played a pivotal role in introducing postcolonial literature from Africa to the rest of the world, serving as a practical manifestation of the issues discussed during the conference, such as accessibility, visibility, and recognition of African literature on a global scale. Overall, the conference discussions revolved around defining African literature, fostering a sense of community among African writers, creating platforms for greater visibility and accessibility, and challenging Western-centric perspectives in literature critique. These discussions provided impetus for significant milestones in African literature, such as the development of the African Writers Series, promotion of new writers like Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and publicizing strong positions on criticism in Achebe's essay \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\"."},{"question":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The post-election rout in U.S. stocks has driven the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) down so far that it would have to advance 26 percent to reach the valuation of bull markets since John F. Kennedy was in the White House. Investors have seen 806 billion erased from the value of American equities since President Barack Obama was re-elected Nov. 6 in the biggest decline since May. The combination of falling stocks and rising profits as the economy recovers has left the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio below the ending level of eight of the nine bull markets since 1962 and beneath the average of any since Ronald Reagan was in power. Bears say the 4.8 percent drop in the S&P 500 and valuations show investors are losing confidence that Congress and Obama will reach a budget compromise that would keep the recovery from stalling. Bulls, including the top strategists at six Wall Street firms, say that the declines are another reason to buy and that stock prices from Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Dollar Tree (DLTR) Inc. are bound to improve as earnings increase. “The stock market looks cheap because people are way too pessimistic about what growth looks like for the next 10 years,” said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee 208 billion as chief strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds and predicts the S&P 500 will rise 47 percent to 2,000 in 2014. “You can get big and rapid moves in the market when expectations are so low.” Concern about the so-called fiscal cliff -- 607 billion of spending cuts and tax increases that automatically go into effect Jan. 1 -- overshadowed better-than-estimated profit reports from Cisco Systems Inc. and Home Depot Inc. last week, sending the S&P 500 down 1.5 percent to 1,359.88. Obama began face-to-face talks with top Republicans and Democrats on Nov. 16 after he and House Speaker John Boehner said they will work toward an agreement. Boehner and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney described the meeting as “constructive.” Even as shares fall, strategists are optimistic about gains next year. The S&P 500 will rally 17 percent to a record 1,585 by the end of 2013, according to the average forecast. The index climbed 1.3 percent to 1,376.96 at 9:36 a.m. New York time today. Douglas Kass, the founder of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. in Palm Beach, Florida, who recommended buying stocks at the March 2009 low says the benchmark gauge may rise 18 percent to 1,600 next year as politicians reach a budget compromise and the economy continues to expand. “The No. 1 mistake that is being made is the old proverb, ‘Once bitten, twice shy’,” Kass said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene. “Market participants today are incorrectly playing the last war, which took place during the budget deliberations in August of last year. Those fears are misplaced.” Savita Subramanian of Bank of America Corp. says the index will rally to 1,600 on rising corporate profits and diminishing concerns about the global economy. John Stoltzfus, at Oppenheimer & Co., forecasts the gauge will climb to 1,585 and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin estimates 1,575, based on support from the Federal Reserve’s third round of bond purchases. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pledged in September that the central bank will buy 40 billion of mortgage securities a month until the U.S. labor market recovers. Optimism is misplaced unless Obama and Republican leaders are able to agree on measures to avoid the mandated cuts and tax increases, according to James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC in Chicago. The 607 billion burden could cause the world’s largest economy to shrink 0.5 percent next year, according to a Nov. 8 Congressional Budget Office report. “Up until the election day no one had priced in a fiscal cliff because the thinking overwhelmingly on Wall Street was there wasn’t going to be one,” Bianco said in a Nov. 14 Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re only now starting to price it in and we’ve only been pricing it in for a week. If we continue to keep our pencils down, there’s going to be a lot more pain.” The economy is recovering at the slowest post-recession rate since World War II, as the housing market stagnated until this year and unemployment stayed above 8 percent through August. Lawmakers of both parties say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff’s economic shock while addressing the deficit. Boehner said Nov. 16 that Republicans are willing to consider revenue- raising measures in exchange for spending cuts. Obama said tax rates should rise without specifying that the top rate must return to the 39.6 percent stipulated. While the S&P 500 has doubled since Obama first took office, the index’s price-earnings ratio was lower than the 16.4 six-decade average for 38 of the rally’s 46 months, as earnings surged, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The multiple is up 35 percent since March 2009, compared with the average expansion of 55 percent in bull markets since 1962, Bloomberg data show. For the past 2 1/2 years, the S&P 500 hasn’t climbed higher than 16 times earnings, compared with the average ratio of 17.4 in past rallies. The valuation rose to a high of 13.8 from 7.3 during the first 15 months of the 1982 advance that pushed the S&P 500 up 229 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the 1990s rally led by technology companies, it almost doubled to 28.5 during the eight years. “As a country, we go from glum to glee and glum to glee over and over again,” James Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about 325 billion, said in a phone interview. “After the 2008 recession and the tech bubble, we’re back at glum, so what comes next?” he said. “Confidence, and the ability to rebuild it, is our biggest asset for the future.” Economists predict global GDP will increase 2.6 percent next year from 2.2 percent in 2012, the slowest since it contracted three years ago, according to a survey by Bloomberg. The pace of U.S. growth will be 2 percent in 2013, down from 2.2 percent this year, according to the median of 98 estimates. The tumble since Obama defeated Republican candidate Mitt Romney, with 332 electoral votes to 206, pushed the benchmark gauge to 13.7 times reported profits, lower than the 15.5 average ratio since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only one bull market since 1962 has ended with a lower valuation: the six-year cycle through 1980 in which the index gained 126 percent to 140.52, or 9.1 times profits. The ratio averaged 17.4 during the nine rallies and ended at about 19.9. Reaching the mean level would require a 26 percent gain in the S&P 500, holding earnings constant, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Should profits meet analysts’ 2013 projection, the index would need a 42 percent gain from the Nov. 16 closing price. Earnings are forecast to climb to a record 110.80 a share next year, almost double what companies posted in 2008, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. “Valuations are cheap given what we’ve seen in earnings,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania. His firm oversees 6.5 billion in assets. “Corporate America is strong, balance sheets are exceptionally strong and flush with cash. We do not believe we’ll have a contraction in earnings next year. We expect profit growth to re-accelerate in the second half of 2013.” Apple, which has fallen 25 percent from its high of 702.10 on Sept. 19 traded at 11.9 times reported profits, a 14 percent discount to its five-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ratio reached a record 23.3 times income 2 1/2 years ago, even after the Cupertino, California-based company posted record earnings in the first quarter. Profits for Dollar Tree, which sells everything from toys to pet food for 1 or less, will rise 24 percent in fiscal 2013, ending in January, and 13 percent the next year, according to analyst estimates. While the shares have almost tripled since March 2009, the price-earnings ratio at 16.7 is 21 percent below the five-year average. Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) trades 22 percent below its historic valuation, even though earnings at the Dallas-based company have surpassed analyst projections for the past five quarters and are forecast to rise 65 percent in 2013. The shares are up 4.3 percent in 2012. Of the 500 companies in the index, 245 have price-earnings ratios below their five-year means, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s up from 196 at this time last year and 174 two years ago, the data show. Bull markets “normally finish with a real burst of hyper enthusiasm,” Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management, which oversees 3.5 billion, said in a phone interview. “We haven’t seen the beginning of that yet.

I'll choose the first option, as it's more common. 2. \\"in the distance\\" - This can be translated as \\"en la distancia\\" or \\"a lo lejos\\". I'll choose \\"a lo lejos\\" as it's a more natural expression in Spanish. 3. \\"is\\" can be translated as \\"es\\". 4. \\"the Metropolitan Cathedral\\" - The proper noun \\"Metropolitan Cathedral\\" can be directly translated to Spanish as \\"la Catedral Metropolitana\\". 5. \\"a 19th century reconstruction\\" can be translated as \\"una reconstrucción del siglo XIX,\\" considering the adjective \\"19th century\\" translates to \\"del siglo XIX\\" and \\"reconstruction\\" translates to \\"reconstrucción\\". 6. \\"of the original church\\" can be translated as \\"de la iglesia original\\". 7. \\"of 1617\\" can be translated as \\"de 1617\\".

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","response":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences provide distinct information about the U.S. capacity. It is important to understand the meaning of each statement and analyze the relationship between them. Sentence 1 provides a specific numerical value of the current capacity in the U.S., stating that it is equal to 465 million pounds per year, or 233,000 tons. This presents a clear and quantifiable understanding of the present situation. Sentence 2, on the other hand, discusses a future expectation that the U.S. capacity will improve in the coming years. This suggests that there will be growth or development in the capacity, but does not provide a specific numerical value or a definite timeline as to when this improvement will occur. As the first sentence provides information about the present capacity, while the second sentence talks about the future expectations, they are not directly related and do not entail each other. The second sentence could be considered as additional information or a prediction, but it does not necessarily follow logically from the first sentence. To better understand the relationship between these two sentences, it would be helpful to have more context, background information, or data that could aid in making a connection between the current capacity and the anticipated improvement in capacity. For example, it would be useful to know if there are any specific projects, policies, or strategies in place aiming at increasing the capacity in the U.S. in the near future. In the absence of more information however, we cannot conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first."},{"question":"The Louvin Brothers were an American musical duo composed of brothers Ira Lonnie Loudermilk (1924–1965) and Charlie Elzer Loudermilk (1927–2011), better known as Ira and Charlie Louvin. The brothers are cousins to John D. Loudermilk, a Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? They weren't the first artists inducted in the hall of fame in their family","response":"From the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that the Louvin Brothers, Ira and Charlie Louvin, were not the first artists in their family to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, was a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, indicating that he was likely inducted before them. The Louvin Brothers started off by singing gospel music in their early career, eventually transitioning to secular country music. They were known for their close harmony vocals, making them an influential act in the history of country music. Their extensive repertoire includes classics like \\"When I Stop Dreaming,\\" \\"I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby,\\" and \\"Cash on the Barrelhead,\\" which showcased their signature harmony style and demonstrated their adept songwriting skills. Despite their significant impact on the country music scene, it is essential to verify the order in which they were inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame compared to their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, to confirm the sentence's accuracy. John D. Loudermilk, a singer and songwriter in his own right, is best known for writing a vast collection of hit songs for many other artists. Some of his renowned compositions include \\"Tobacco Road,\\" \\"Indian Reservation,\\" and \\"A Rose And A Baby Ruth.\\" He had a long and successful career in the music industry, earning him his induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1976. The Louvin Brothers were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, a separate entity from the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. It should be noted that there is a difference between these two honors, and induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame does not necessarily imply induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. However, being inducted into the former is also a prestigious achievement, showcasing the brothers' impact on country music both as performers and songwriters. Considering the information at hand, it could be inferred that the Louvin Brothers were not the first in their family to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, as their cousin, John D. Loudermilk, had been inducted in 1976. Meanwhile, the Louvin Brothers themselves were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, which is an honor that further affirms their contributions to country music and its growth."},{"question":"Tito's visits to the United States avoided most of the Northeast due to large minorities of Yugoslav emigrants bitter about communism in Yugoslavia.

He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. But I can use this background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. What is an answer for this question: Which lever would produce greater increase in force, lever A or lever B? A:","response":"In the given situation, Lever A is a hypothetical lever with an ideal mechanical advantage, while Lever B is a real-world lever. Before addressing the question of which lever would produce a greater increase in force, it is important to understand mechanical advantage and how it affects the increase in force. Mechanical advantage (MA) is a measure of how much a machine can amplify or change the input force into output force. In other words, it describes how effectively a machine or lever can convert an input force (effort) into a larger output force (load). The ideal mechanical advantage (IMA) is a theoretical measure of how much the input force would be increased or decreased if there were no friction or other losses in the machine. However, in the real world, there is always some friction to be overcome, which leads to a distinction between the ideal mechanical advantage and the actual mechanical advantage. Now, considering the two levers, Lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning that it can increase the input force to the maximum level without any loss due to friction. On the other hand, Lever B, being a real-world lever, is likely to have some friction and losses, which would result in a reduction of the actual mechanical advantage. Therefore, in terms of producing a greater increase in force, Lever A would be more effective as it has the ideal mechanical advantage. The ideal mechanical advantage aptly indicates that in a perfect, frictionless scenario, Lever A would provide the maximum possible increase in force. Meanwhile, Lever B, due to its real-world constraints like friction, would have a lower actual mechanical advantage, resulting in a less significant increase in force when compared to Lever A."},{"question":"Can we conclude from \\"A black man smoking a cigarette is in front of a government type building.\\" that \\"A man smokes.\\"?

He wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now called WWE) under the ring names 1-2-3 Kid and X-Pac intermittently between 1993 and 2002, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Syxx, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Syxx-Pac and Sean Waltman. He is currently signed with WWE working in their Legends program. Waltman has won a dozen championships between WWE, WCW, and TNA; the majority were cruiserweight and tag team titles. As The Lightning Kid, Waltman had his WWF tryout match in Phoenix, Arizona, the day after WrestleMania IX, against fellow hopeful Louie Spicolli (soon known as Rad Radford in the WWF). He reminisced that he was lucky to have an opponent with a vested interest in an impressive match, rather than (as was then typical) a disinterested WWF veteran jobber like Virgil or Jim Powers. After earning a contract, he made his TV debut as The Kamikaze Kid on Monday Night Raw on May 3, losing to Doink the Clown. He quickly became The Cannonball Kid, then simply The Kid. He scored an upset pinfall on Razor Ramon on the May 17 episode of Monday Night Raw, thus becoming The 1-2-3 Kid. Razor challenged him to a rematch, wagering 10,000 of his own money. Kid accepted the challenge, but grabbed the money and ran from the arena during the match. Ted DiBiase, who was feuding with Razor, taunted him over losing to a nobody. This angered Kid, and led to a match in which he upset DiBiase as well. Razor turned face shortly after and took Kid under his wing. The 1-2-3 Kid made his pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam, losing to DiBiase's tag partner Irwin R. Schyster after Razor had defeated DiBiase. At Survivor Series, Kid was on Razor's team in a four-on-four elimination match. He and Marty Jannetty were the sole survivors, which led to them forming a tag team and holding the Tag Team Championship for a week in January 1994 after beating The Quebecers. For the next two years, The 1-2-3 Kid was a natural underdog and fan favorite. He wrestled Bret Hart in an unusually long (for the time) and highly acclaimed match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in July 11, 1994 on Raw and had another brief (one-day) tag title reign in January 1995, with Bob Holly beating Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka at the 1995 Royal Rumble before losing to The Smoking Gunns on Raw.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did Waltman team up with any other wrestlers between 93-95?","response":"Yes, between 1993 and 1995, Waltman teamed up with several other wrestlers.

Is The earliest unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. a good answer to this question?","response":"Yes, the statement provided is a good answer to the question, but it can be expanded with additional details for a more comprehensive response. Answer: The animal found with 17,000-year-old damage from tuberculosis is a bison, specifically discovered in Wyoming, USA. This evidence involves the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis. The 17,000-year-old bison remains not only provide insights into the history of tuberculosis but also shed light on its evolutionary origins and transmission between species. Paleontological and molecular studies on the bison's remains led to the identification of tuberculosis-inflicted lesions on its bones. This finding suggests that tuberculosis has been present in the animal kingdom for an extended period, and the disease has evolved and adapted over thousands of years. Additionally, the presence of tuberculosis in a wild animal such as the bison implies that the bacterium could have been transmitted between different species through natural processes like inhalation, ingestion, or contact with infected bodily fluids. Furthermore, the discovery of tuberculosis in the ancient bison contributes to the understanding of the history and evolution of this disease in both humans and animals. Ancient human remains have also exhibited signs of tuberculosis, with some dating back to around 9,000 years ago. These findings indicate that the disease has affected various creatures, including wild animals, domesticated animals, and humans, throughout history. In conclusion, the animal found with 17,000-year-old damage from tuberculosis is a bison from Wyoming. This discovery provides significant evidence of the earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and important information about the disease's evolution and transmission across species. It is an invaluable contribution to the understanding of tuberculosis and offers a historical context for ongoing research and efforts to eradicate the disease."},{"question":"Choose from the options at the end.

When shopping for skincare products, look for facial moisturizers that contain collagen peptides. Collagen is a part of your skin that helps it remain moisturized and elastic. Over time, the collagen in facial skin breaks down, contributing to both sagging and wrinkles. Using a collagen cream may help replenish your skin’s natural collagen, making your skin appear tighter and more moisturized. Not all collagen creams contain the same added ingredients or percentage of collagen. When using a collagen cream, read the label carefully to see how often the cream should be applied. Vitamin C serums contain concentrated doses of vitamin C that can tighten skin, reduce sun and age spots, reduce redness, and boost the production of collagen. Unlike drinking vitamin C (which is also healthy!), serums allow your skin direct contact with the vitamin so that the benefits are absorbed right into your skin. Vitamin C serums are safe for most skin types, so this is a great option if you have any allergies or skin sensitivities. Serums often include other skin-tightening ingredients, including retinols, hyaluronic acid, and collagen peptides. Most vitamin C serums are safe to use 1 to 2 times per day. However, always check the label on your vitamin C serum to see how often it is safe to use. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally-produced molecule that binds water to the collagen in your facial skin. Like collagen, hyaluronic acid breaks down over time, leaving your skin vulnerable to dehydration and sagging. Applying a hyaluronic acid moisturizer daily can help re-hydrate your skin, making it appear tighter and healthier. Hyaluronic acid is generally considered a great option for all skin types and does not usually trigger allergic reactions, break outs, or rosacea. Thus, it can usually be added to your daily skincare routine. These products work through exfoliation, meaning they cause shedding of the surface skin. Be aware that using creams with glycolic or lactic acid can increase your skin’s sensitivity to UV. If you start noticing that your skin is getting redder in the sun than before you started using this cream, stop using it and try a different treatment. Check the ingredients before you buy, because the concentration of acid should be 10 percent or less to be safe. Retinol is one of the most popular skin-tightening ingredients and can be found at almost any pharmacy, drug store, or skincare retailer. Retinol creams have been shown to help reduce wrinkles, tighten skin, and make skin damage less visible. While retinol can be the most effective skin-tightening ingredient for some, it comes with a long list of potential side effects, including dryness, irritation, sensitivity to sunlight, redness, swelling, and blistering. Because retinols can cause irritation, it is generally recommended that you use them only 2 to 4 times per week. If you experience any side effects, decrease your usage to 1 time per week. Contact your doctor if the side effects persist or are extreme. Retinol may also help reduce acne outbreaks.

That possibility has been created by the discovery of a new class of insect repellant made in the laboratory of Vanderbilt Professor of Biological Sciences and Pharmacology Laurence Zwiebel and reported this week in the online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"It wasn't something we set out to find,\\" said David Rinker, a graduate student who performed the study in collaboration with graduate student Gregory Pask and post-doctoral fellow Patrick Jones. \\"It was an anomaly that we noticed in our tests.\\" The tests were conducted as part of a major interdisciplinary research project to develop new ways to control the spread of malaria by disrupting a mosquito's sense of smell supported by the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative funded by the Foundation for the NIH through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \\"It's too soon to determine whether this specific compound can act as the basis of a commercial product,\\" Zwiebel cautioned. \\"But it is the first of its kind and, as such, can be used to develop other similar compounds that have characteristics appropriate for commercialization.\\" The discovery of this new class of repellant is based on insights that scientists have gained about the basic nature of the insect's sense of smell in the last few years. Although the mosquito's olfactory system is housed in its antennae, 10 years ago biologists thought that it worked in the same way at the molecular level as it does in mammals. A family of special proteins called odorant receptors, or ORs, sits on the surface of nerve cells in the nose of mammals and in the antennae of mosquitoes. When these receptors come into contact with smelly molecules, they trigger the nerves signaling the detection of specific odors. In the last few years, however, scientists have been surprised to learn that the olfactory system of mosquitoes and other insects is fundamentally different. In the insect system, conventional ORs do not act autonomously. Instead, they form a complex with a unique co-receptor (called Orco) that is also required to detect odorant molecules. ORs are spread all over the antennae and each responds to a different odor. To function, however, each OR must be connected to an Orco. \\"Think of an OR as a microphone that can detect a single frequency,\\" Zwiebel said. \\"On her antenna the mosquito has dozens of types of these microphones, each tuned to a specific frequency. Orco acts as the switch in each microphone that tells the brain when there is a signal. When a mosquito smells an odor, the microphone tuned to that smell will turn \\"on\\" its Orco switch. The other microphones remain off. However, by stimulating Orco directly we can turn them all on at once. This would effectively overload the mosquito's sense of smell and shut down her ability to find blood.\\" Because the researchers couldn't predict what chemicals might modulate OR-Orco complexes, they decided to \\"throw the kitchen sink\\" at the problem. Through their affiliation with Vanderbilt's Institute of Chemical Biology, they gained access to Vanderbilt's high throughput screening facility, a technology intended for the drug discovery process, not for the screening of insect ORs. Jones used genetic engineering techniques to insert mosquito odorant receptors into the human embryonic kidney cells used in the screening process. Rinker tested these cells against a commercial library of 118,000 small molecules normally used in drug development. They expected to find, and did find, a number of compounds that triggered a response in the conventional mosquito ORs they were screening, but they were surprised to find one compound that consistently triggered OR-Orco complexes, leading them to conclude that they had discovered the first molecule that directly stimulates the Orco co-receptor. They have named the compound VUAA1. Although it is not an odorant molecule, the researchers determined that VUAA1 activates insect OR-Orco complexes in a manner similar to a typical odorant molecule. Jones also verified that mosquitoes respond to exposure to VUAA1, a crucial step in demonstrating that VUAA1 can affect a mosquito's behavior. \\"If a compound like VUAA1 can activate every mosquito OR at once, then it could overwhelm the insect's sense of smell, creating a repellant effect akin to stepping onto an elevator with someone wearing too much perfume, except this would be far worse for the mosquito,\\" Jones said. The researchers have just begun behavioral studies with the compound. In preliminary tests with mosquitoes, they have found that VUAA1 is thousands of times more effective than DEET. They have also established that the compound stimulates the OR-Orco complexes of flies, moths and ants. As a result, \\"VUAA1 opens the door for the development of an entirely new class of agents, which could be used not only to disrupt disease vectors, but also the nuisance insects in your backyard or the agricultural pests in your crops,\\" Jones said. Many questions must be answered before VUAA1 can be considered for commercial applications. Zwiebel's team is currently working with researchers in Vanderbilt's Drug Discovery Program to pare away the parts of VUAA1 that don't contribute to its activity. Once that is done, they will begin testing its toxicity. Vanderbilt University has filed for a patent on this class of compounds and is talking with potential corporate licensees interested in incorporating them into commercial products, with special focus on development of products to reduce the spread of malaria in the developing world. ||||| Write a summary.","response":"Researchers at Vanderbilt University have discovered a new class of insect repellent that is thousands of times more effective than DEET, the active ingredient in most commercial mosquito repellents. The new repellent, named VUAA1, works against all types of insects, including flies, moths, and ants. The compound was found to stimulate odorant receptor (OR)-Orco complexes in insects, overloading their sense of smell and preventing them from finding blood. While it is still too early to determine if VUAA1 can become the basis of a commercial product, it has the potential to be developed into a new class of agents that can be used to control the spread of malaria as well as disrupt other nuisance insects and agricultural pests."},{"question":"Here is a premise: \\"A group of people walking by a lake.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"There are people walking in warm weather\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","response":"No, the premise, or the short description you told me, about \\"a group of people walking by a lake\\" doesn't tell us anything about the weather.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Electrons are one of three main types of particles that make up the atom. They are extremely small and have an electric charge of -1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons. Choices: - nuclei and neutrons - photons and protons - electrons and neutrons - electrons and protons A: Answer:","response":"The detailed answer to the given question is that all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. This is evident in the provided paragraph, which states that \\"All atoms have the same number of electrons as protons.\\" Atoms are the building blocks of matter and are composed of three main types of particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles (-1 electric charge) that orbit the nucleus of the atom. In contrast, protons are positively charged particles (+1 electric charge) and are found within the nucleus, along with neutrons, which have no charge. The number of electrons and protons determines the atomic number and chemical properties of an atom. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, and it also equals the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus in a neutral atom. The balance between the negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons is what gives an atom its overall neutral charge. In the context of the provided paragraph and given options, the correct answer is that all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons. Other options such as nuclei and neutrons, photons and protons, or electrons and neutrons are not correct in this context. The number of neutrons can vary within the same atomic element, giving rise to isotopes, whereas photons are particles of light and are not components of an atom."},{"question":"I know that the answer to the question \\"The government in what area had an impact on Thailand?\\" is in \\"The Dutch East India Company (1800) and British East India Company (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies.

By itself, it does not provide enough information to determine the subject of her conversation or her actions. To state that \\"A woman is ordering food\\" as a logical follow-up, we would require more information or context to connect the two statements accurately. For instance, if we had additional information such as \\"A woman in a restaurant talking to a waiter\\" or \\"A woman in a restaurant looking at the menu and discussing her preferences,\\" it would be more reasonable to infer that she might be ordering food. However, there are many potential reasons for a woman to be talking in a restaurant. She could be engaged in a variety of conversations or activities unrelated to food ordering, such as: 1. Discussing business with a colleague. 2. Having a casual conversation with a friend or family member. 3. Talking to a restaurant staff member regarding her reservation, dietary restrictions, or other inquiries. 4. Speaking with the restaurant manager about a concern, compliment, or complaint. 5. Engaging in a phone call or participating in an online meeting. Additionally, considering the fact that restaurants can host various events or gatherings, a woman could be talking during a celebration, announcement, or presentation. In these cases as well, it would not automatically imply that she is ordering food. In conclusion, merely stating that \\"A woman in a restaurant is talking\\" does not provide sufficient evidence or context to deduce that \\"A woman is ordering food\\" logically. For a logical follow-up or inference to be made, we need more information to establish a clearer connection between the two statements. Furthermore, numerous possible reasons or scenarios can explain the woman's conversation in a restaurant, and not all of them are directly related to food ordering."},{"question":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Why does the dead body weigh so much? Movie plot title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version... Answer:","response":"The dead body in the movie \\"Imprint\\" weighs so much because the woman was heavily pregnant. The boatman deduces her pregnancy after noticing the weight and seeing her condition upon turning her over. This added weight is due to the developing fetus and the changes that occur within a woman's body during pregnancy, such as increased blood volume and amniotic fluid."},{"question":"Q: Title: Great singer/Great songs/Great Record!!

She stood up and smiled, without making any sound. The American teacher looked at himself and didn't see anything funny. So he asked her the question again. The girl just smiled but said nothing. The teacher was angry. He didn't know that the girl smiled to cover her embarrassment because she wasn't able to answer the question. In a dining room in Beijing, an Englishman was careless and dropped a plate. The Chinese who had seen this began to laugh. The Englishman felt uncomfortable and even got angry. \\"They are laughing at me,\\" he thought. In fact the Chinese laughed not at the Englishman or his bad luck--whether he is a foreigner or a Chinese. The smile or laughter has several feelings: don't take it so seriously; laugh it off, it's nothing; such things can happen to any of us. Question: What does the writer want to tell us? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Smile and laughter don't mean the same thing to different people.\\"? Answer:","response":"The writer wants to tell us that cultural differences play a significant role in how people perceive and interpret actions and emotions like smiling and laughter, and that misunderstandings can easily arise when people from different backgrounds interact with each other. In the examples provided in the article, both the American teacher and the Englishman misinterpret the smiles and laughter of their Chinese counterparts. In the first scenario, the Chinese girl uses her smile as a way to cope with her embarrassment at not being able to answer the teacher's question. The teacher, on the other hand, perceives her smile as laughter directed towards him, which angers him. Similarly, in the second scenario, the Chinese people's laughter after the Englishman drops a plate is not intended to ridicule him or his misfortune. Instead, it is their way of expressing empathy and showing that such things happen to everyone, regardless of nationality. Based on these examples, the answer to the question, \\"Smile and laughter don't mean the same thing to different people,\\" is \\"Yes.\\" The writer demonstrates that people from different cultural backgrounds might interpret or express emotions like smiling and laughing differently, and it is essential to be aware of these differences to avoid misunderstandings and promote better communication."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Eiffel Tower.

Examine your apartment for dirt. Examine your apartment for damage. Make sure your appliances are functioning properly. Talk to your landlord about any damage or problems you find. Article:","response":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Preparing for Your Move-out Inspection: Practical Tips for a Smooth Transition Introduction Moving out of a rented apartment can be an overwhelming task, especially when dealing with the pressure of ensuring that your living space is clean, undamaged and fit for the next tenant. Navigating the move-out process can be time-consuming, but a little planning and organization can help you avoid unpleasant surprises and additional charges. In this article, we will discuss practical tips on how to prepare for your move-out inspection effectively and ensure a smooth transition to your new home. Step 1: Review the Move-out Policy in Your Lease Before you start planning your move, it's crucial to review the move-out policy outlined in your lease agreement. The lease is a legally binding document that specifies your responsibilities as a tenant and the expectations of your landlord at the end of your tenancy. Carefully read through the policy to understand aspects like: - Notice period: the time frame within which you should inform your landlord about your intention to move out - Cleaning requirements: details about the expected level of cleanliness in the apartment - Repair responsibilities: the extent of your liability for any damages or repairs that might be required - Inspection timeline: when the move-out inspection will be conducted and how much notice will be given. Being informed about these crucial points will provide you with a clear picture of your obligations and help you in planning your move efficiently. Step 2: Examine Your Apartment for Dirt Now that you have reviewed your move-out policy, it's time to thoroughly examine your apartment for cleanliness. Remember that leaving a rental unit in pristine condition is not only crucial for getting your security deposit back but is also the best practice for fostering a positive relationship with your landlord. Pay attention to the following areas: - Walls: Check for stains, scuffs and marks on walls and baseboards and clean them using appropriate cleaning materials - Floors: Vacuum the carpets, sweep and mop the floors, ensuring all dirt, stains and crumbs are removed - Kitchen: Clean the countertops, empty and clean the cabinets and shelves, and scrub the sink - Bathroom: Remove any mold, mildew or soap scum, clean the toilet, bathtub, shower and sink, and sanitize the floor - Windows: Clean the glass, window sills and window tracks. Step 3: Examine Your Apartment for Damage After addressing the cleaning aspect, conduct a thorough examination of your apartment for any damages. Look for issues like chipped paint, broken fixtures, damaged appliances or cracked tiles that might have occurred during your tenancy. If you find any damage, make a list and take photos for your records. You should also consult your lease to determine whether you are responsible for repairing the damages or if it falls under your landlord's responsibilities. Step 4: Ensure Your Appliances Are Functioning Properly During your tenure in the apartment, appliances may experience wear and tear or malfunction. Before moving out, confirm that all the appliances provided by your landlord are in good working condition. This includes checking the refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, dishwasher and any other appliances that might be part of your rental agreement. If you identify any issues, repair them yourself or talk to your landlord to determine the best course of action. Step 5: Talk to Your Landlord About Any Damage or Problems Once you have inspected your apartment and identified any possible problems or damages, it's essential to communicate your findings with your landlord. Transparent communication will allow both parties to discuss amicable solutions and prevent misunderstandings. Provide them with copies of any photos or documentation that you have taken during your inspection and explain the nature of the problem. Your landlord will appreciate your honesty and proactive approach, which will go a long way in ensuring a smooth move-out process. Conclusion Preparing for a move-out inspection is a crucial aspect of transitioning from one apartment to another. By reviewing your lease, conducting thorough checks for dirt and damages, ensuring appliances are functioning properly, and maintaining open communication with your landlord, you will pave the way for a positive and stress-free moving experience."},{"question":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

There were many who knew Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii who passed away Monday, better than we did. But we had the good fortune of sitting with him this past summer, interviewing him and hearing some of the remarkable stories from his life in America's service. The portrait that emerged was that of a man of courage, character, and, perhaps above all, a singular spirit of peace and good will that was forged, paradoxically, amid some of the most horrendous carnage of the Second World War. News: Hawaii's Daniel Inouye, Senate's second longest-serving member, dead at 88. Some of Inouye's deeds -- his valor serving on the German front in one of America's most decorated (and heavily wounded) units, his Herculean political efforts on behalf of his home state -- have been well remarked. What we were especially struck by was his quiet, sagelike humanity. There was his story, for example, of the day during the war when he came upon a German soldier who appeared to be preparing to kill him. The German, as Inouye told it, put his hand into his shirt, and Inouye, thinking he was reaching for his weapon, \\"smashed him in the face.\\" As the man hit the ground, his hand fell out of his shirt, revealing photographs -- the soldier's wife, his kids. \\"So help me, up until that moment, I looked upon Germans as enemies, period,\\" said Inouye, who had by then killed many enemy soldiers already. \\"From that moment, I looked upon him as a father, son, uncle, boyfriend. He was human. And it's not easy to kill.\\" It was, he said, what he always told people when they expressed disbelief that he, a decorated veteran, could stand up against the war in Iraq. \\"You've got to convince me before we go to war,\\" he maintained. \\"You would never forget running over a dog -- the bump. If you don't forget that, how can you forget killing a human being?\\" To hear Inouye talk was to sit beside a still, fathomless pool -- he spoke with a measured calm and wisdom that made clear how deep the dignity beneath it ran. In that way, he called to mind an echo of former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield -- of whom, Inouye said, \\"If there was a mentor, it was him.\\" And he carried Mansfield's stoic ability to forge consensus and compromise with him, far into a legislative era known for its strident opposites. Of his 12 subcommittees, Inouye told us in July, \\"Nine of them have reported out their bills almost unanimously. About six were unanimous -- 30-0. The others were 29-1, 28-2. ... That's this month. It can be done! ... And 30-0 includes (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell!\\" His secret was deceptively straightforward: a steady practice of simple gestures -- sitting with senators who had objections, calling a senior Republican \\"vice chairman\\" instead of \\"ranking member\\" (\\"I hate that word 'ranking' -- it's something like 'stink'!\\"), not speaking ill of anyone to the press. \\"It might take some patience, but when I found out that you were pissed about (a) program, I'd sit down with you and talk about it,\\" he told us. \\"Little things like that make a difference.\\" It was a basic humanity and a largeness of vision that Inouye extended to individuals from all backgrounds, born not only out of his experiences seeing his own people -- Japanese-Americans -- vilified and interned during World War II (Inouye himself signed up as soon as the U.S. government lifted its ban on American-born Japanese enlistments), but from his own crucibles in the war. Describing the injury that cost him his right arm and very nearly his life, Inouye told us of being taken to the Army hospital, of being initially counted a hopeless case, of having his arm amputated without anesthesia, of ultimately receiving 17 blood transfusions to stay alive. Of those 17 transfusions, he explained:. \\"That made a little difference in my outlook on life. In our last battle, the regiment was attached to the 92nd Division -- all African-American. Hospitals were run by the 92nd Division, and in those days, I don't know about the other hospitals, but in the one I was in, (the blood) came in a glass bottle, with tape -- donated by so and so, private, 92nd Division. So you know he's African-American. Well I got 17 pints. \\"If it weren't for (the 92nd), I wouldn't be here. The war did a lot to change your ideas. I looked upon (people of color), as I do today, as brothers. What else can I do? After all, I've got the same blood.\\" Throughout its history, the nation has been blessed to have men like Inouye -- reserved, unboastful men, whose actions show the deep reservoir of quiet honor from which they draw their strength. Who show the courage that Hemingway called \\"grace under pressure.\\" When he was first brought to the Army field hospital after sustaining the wounds that would claim his arm, Inouye related, \\"The doctors looked at me; they're mumbling among themselves,\\" he recalled. \\"Two minutes later a chaplain comes up -- opening words: 'God loves you.' \\"I said: 'I know that. I love him too,\\" he recounted with a chuckle. \\"'But I'm not ready to meet him yet!'\\" No one can know the ways of the Lord, but we would be surprised if he wasn't happy to meet Dan Inouye today.

Returning to work was easy for Dan. He had liked doing nothing for weeks, and after his treatment he was complately what? Options: - sobering - work - painless - malaise - boredom Answer. painless What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","response":"The answer \\"painless\\" is justified through this step-by-step reasoning: 1. Understand the context: The question describes Dan's experience of returning to work after doing nothing for weeks and undergoing some sort of treatment. You must determine the word that best describes his post-treatment state. 2. Evaluate each option: a) sobering: Although this word typically means becoming more serious or thoughtful, it doesn’t fit the context as it doesn't directly relate to Dan's experience. b) work: This option simply refers to the general concept of work and does not provide an adjective to describe how Dan felt after the treatment. c) painless: In the context of the question, this term means that Dan experienced no discomfort or difficulty when returning to work after treatment. This option aligns with the information provided about how easy it was for Dan to return to work. d) malaise: This word indicates a general feeling of unease or discomfort. It contradicts the idea that Dan's return to work was easy. e) boredom: This term means a state of being weary and uninterested due to a lack of variety or excitement. It doesn't provide information about Dan's feelings when he returned to work. 3. Compare options: Based on the context and evaluation of each option, \\"painless\\" is the most appropriate choice, as it suggests that Dan faced no difficulties when he returned to work after the treatment. 4. Conclusion: The answer \\"painless\\" justifies that Dan's return to work was easy and comfortable after his treatment, a contrast to the weeks he had spent doing nothing."},{"question":"Given the question: Given the background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. and the situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.

Politico reports the former secretary of State “is strongly considering delaying the formal launch” of her campaign from April until July. The story cites unnamed Democrats and advisers. A Democrat familiar with Clinton’s thinking said: ‘She doesn’t feel under any pressure, and they see no primary challenge on the horizon. If you have the luxury of time, you take it.’ The 2016 presidential race seems to have gotten underway already, with several potential candidates in early stages of organizing. But none of the major candidates has officially launched a 2016 campaign. Republicans Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Scott Walker have created committees that would assist in fundraising and serve as vehicles to promote their ideas. Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rick Perry are among the Republicans who have brought on staff in anticipation of White House bids. On the Democratic side, Jim Webb announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. But the former Virginia senator is considered a long shot for the nomination, with early public opinion polls all showing Clinton far ahead of any potential Democratic rivals. By way of comparison, President Obama formally launched his re-election drive in April 2011 by sending an e-mail to supporters and posting a video on a campaign website. Romney did his official kick-off in June 2011, with a speech before supporters in New Hampshire. For her first presidential race, Clinton announced she was “in to win” with a message posted January 2007 on her website. Summary:","response":"Hillary Clinton is reportedly considering delaying the formal announcement of her likely presidential campaign to sometime this summer.

In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - UltraViolet is a women 's advocacy group based in the United States . The group conducts online campaigns using social media to highlight women 's issues such as violence against women , maternity leave , equal pay , and reproductive rights . - Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan. - The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health. It was established on 7 April 1948, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the United Nations Development Group. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations. - Social media are computer-mediated technologies that allow the creating and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition. However, there are some common features. - Violence against women (VAW), also known as gender-based violence, is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. Sometimes considered a hate crime, this type of violence targets a specific group with the victim's gender as a primary motive. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly because they are women. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states that: - Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health that vary amongst countries around the world. The World Health Organization defines reproductive rights as follows: - Within the framework of the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, reproductive health, or sexual health/hygiene, addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life. Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.

So, Popik came in first place, while Scott Stringer came in second place. On the other hand, Sentence 2 says that Popik received more than 40,000 votes but became second to Scott Stringer, who received more than 200,000 votes. In this sentence, the positions are reversed: Scott Stringer is the clear winner with over 200,000 votes, and Popik comes in second with more than 40,000 votes.

We then hear Raucher recalling the summer he spent on the island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old \\"Hermie\\" and his friends â jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie â spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind. They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores. Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, \\"giving\\" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\\" Options: A make the same old mistake B overcome them by themselves C experience the worst of things D grow up lacking self-confidence Answer: D grow up lacking self-confidence Question:","response":"What does Dr. Creswell imply may happen to a child if their fears are not properly addressed and managed?

After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

The Best Two Years portrays the experience of four missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints living in the same apartment in Haarlem in the Netherlands. The movie begins with Elder Rogers finding out that his new companion will be a \\"greenie\\", a newly trained missionary fresh from the Missionary Training Center. He and the other two missionaries that reside in the same apartment, Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt, go to the train station to meet the new elder. Elder Rogers finds out that the new missionary, Elder Calhoun, is exactly what he had jokingly predicted his new companion would be like. Elder Rogers used to be an excellent missionary, until his girlfriend married one of his former mission companions. That is why he and the other two missionaries residing in the same apartment are surprised that the mission president has assigned him to be the trainer (first companion and mentor) to a missionary new to the mission. The new missionary, Elder Calhoun, tackles mission work with unbounded enthusiasm. He attempts to talk to anyone although he has little knowledge of the Dutch language. Despite his poor Dutch, he continues to have an eager attitude. Fortunately for him, he soon encounters a man from the United States that speaks English. They speak briefly in the park before the man goes off with his girlfriend. Later, when he encounters the same man in a market, Calhoun gives him a Dutch Book of Mormon with his telephone number.

The race took place at Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, France, on June 24, 2018. This marked the return of the French Grand Prix to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year absence since its last edition in 2008. Starting from pole position, Lewis Hamilton demonstrated an impressive performance throughout the race, maintaining the lead in the majority of the laps and ultimately crossing the finish line first. This win was Hamilton's 65th career victory in Formula One, and the third win of the 2018 Formula One season. The 2018 season was quite successful for Hamilton, as he also won his fifth World Drivers' Championship title, making him one of the most successful drivers in the history of Formula One. In the French Grand Prix 2018, behind Hamilton were Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen who secured the second position and Scuderia Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen who finished third. The event was marked by a dramatic first lap accident which saw several drivers, including Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas, involved in a collision. As a result, Vettel had to fight his way back into the race, finishing fifth, while Bottas finished seventh. The 2018 French Grand Prix was an important milestone in the Formula One calendar, as it not only marked the return of the race to France but also saw Lewis Hamilton proving his dominance in the championship. In addition, Hamilton's victory at Circuit Paul Ricard further consolidated his lead in the World Drivers' Championship standings, which helped him secure his fifth world title later in the season, tying him with the legendary Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio and putting him just two titles behind Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles."},{"question":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","response":"Did you know that the honeybee, a vital insect playing a crucial role in pollinating plants, can recognize human faces and is capable of distinguishing and remembering more than 80,000 different floral odors?"},{"question":"Arsene Wenger fears Olivier Giroud will be ruled out until the New Year, leaving Arsenal to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before Monday’s deadline.

Kieran Gibbs: The left-back suffered a hamstring injury during Arsenal's opening game against Crystal Palace and was ruled out for around three weeks. 2. Mikel Arteta: Arsenal's captain had an ankle injury in the same game against Everton, which led to an extended absence from the team. 3.

A:","response":"Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, was a key figure in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which led to the overthrow of King James II of England, known as James VII in Scotland and also known as the last Catholic king of England. Sir Jonathan Trelawny was born in Cornwall in 1650 and served as both a bishop and a politician during his illustrious career. As a staunch anti-Catholic, Trelawny played a crucial role in opposing the increasingly pro-Catholic policies implemented by King James II. The tension between the king and Parliament boiled over in 1688, culminating in the Glorious Revolution, also known as the \\"Bloodless Revolution.\\" James II faced various challenges during his reign, such as religious conflicts and resistance from Parliament, which was increasingly alarmed by his pro-Catholic stance and efforts to expand his powers. An important turning point came in 1678 with the fictitious Popish Plot, which was a widespread belief that English Catholics were conspiring to kill King Charles II and place his Catholic brother James on the throne. The panic that ensued led to severe persecution of Catholics and a sharp increase in anti-Catholic sentiment. When James II came to power in 1685, he quickly made enemies in his quest to create a more inclusive environment for Catholics. With the birth of his son, James Francis Edward Stuart, fears grew that a Catholic dynasty would be established in England. Consequently, a group of seven British nobles, including Sir Jonathan Trelawny, sent an invitation to William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant prince married to James II's Protestant daughter, Mary Stuart. William of Orange successfully invaded England in November 1688, leading to a rapid collapse of James II's forces. Fearing for his life, James II decided to flee to France, effectively abdicating the throne. Parliament then declared that James II had forfeited the throne and offered it to William of Orange and Mary Stuart, who were jointly crowned King William III and Queen Mary II in February 1689. The Glorious Revolution signaled the end of James II's reign and marked the beginning of a Protestant monarchy under William III and Mary II, asserting the importance of Parliamentary power and the Protestant faith in England. Sir Jonathan Trelawny played a significant role in these events, as both a religious and political leader, working tirelessly to ensure that the new monarchy would align with the values and beliefs he championed."},{"question":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to dye a lacrosse head Plan out the stick design first.

After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","response":"Apollo 13 was the seventh crewed mission in the Apollo space program and the third lunar landing mission, which was launched on April 11, 1970. However, the mission was not successful, as an explosion occurred in the service module due to an oxygen tank failure. The astronauts had to use emergency procedures to return safely to Earth, landing on April 17, 1970. Despite the difficulties during the mission, there were no fatalities associated with Apollo 13. Regarding the question of whether deaths from the Apollo 13 mission were eclipsed by other space missions, the answer is no, as there were no fatalities in the Apollo 13 mission. However, other missions in the history of space exploration have experienced tragedies resulting in astronaut fatalities. Here are few such incidents: 1. Apollo 1: On January 27, 1967, a fire during a pre-flight test resulted in the deaths of Virgil \\"Gus\\" Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee. This tragic event led to significant advances in safety measures and spacecraft design. 2. Soyuz 1: On April 24, 1967, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov died when his capsule crashed due to a parachute failure during re-entry. 3. Soyuz 11: On June 30, 1971, cosmonauts Georgi Dobrovolski, Viktor Patsayev, and Vladislav Volkov lost their lives due to cabin depressurization during re-entry. 4. Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster (STS-51L): On January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven crew members aboard: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Christa McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnik. 5.

Usually, I don't incline towards writing negative reviews, but the lack of quality and terrible service we experienced at this restaurant left me with no choice. To begin with, we had made reservations well in advance. Still, upon arrival, our table was not ready, and we were asked to wait at the bar. It took the hostess almost 25 minutes to finally seat us at our table. We noticed that several other tables were vacant, and it appeared that the restaurant was understaffed, which made us question the unnecessary delay. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant failed to impress. The lighting was too dim to comfortably read the menu, and the temperature inside felt uncomfortably cold, compelling us to keep our jackets on. Additionally, the music was excessively loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation without straining our voices. When it came time to order, our server didn't seem knowledgeable about the menu, and their recommendations came across more as guesses rather than genuine suggestions. After waiting for 45 minutes, we were served our appetizers. Unfortunately, the warm crab cakes we ordered were lukewarm and had a rubbery texture. Even worse, my partner's shrimp cocktail tasted unacceptably stale and gave off a strong, unpleasant odor. Our main course arrived almost 40 minutes after we finished our appetizers. The lobster risotto I ordered was overly salty, and the lobster meat was severely overcooked. My partner's ribeye steak was ordered medium-rare, but it was served nearly well-done. The accompanying side dishes were unappetizing and uninspired; the mashed potatoes were bland and lumpy, and the asparagus was undercooked and chewy. As for the service, our server seemed preoccupied and rarely checked on us throughout our meal. Our water glasses remained empty for most of our dining experience, and we couldn't get our server's attention to rectify this. Added to the frustrations, it took more than 20 minutes to receive our check, and even longer for our server to process our payment. In spite of the glowing reviews and the promise of stunning ocean views, the Ocean View Restaurant did little to meet or exceed our expectations. The lack of quality in both food and service left us feeling extremely disappointed and regretful for having chosen this restaurant. We will not be returning in the future and cannot recommend it to others in good conscience. While I understand that every establishment can have an off night, it is my sincere hope that the management of the Ocean View Restaurant takes this review as constructive criticism and works towards addressing these issues. All their guests deserve a much better dining experience than what we encountered."},{"question":"Question: Given the background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. and the situation: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65. Answer the following question: Which group had a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases? Answer:","response":"Based on the background information provided, it can be concluded that Group A, which consists of people under 35 years old, has a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases as compared to Group B, comprising of people over 65 years old. During late adulthood, individuals experience an increased risk of developing various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. As people age, their bodily functions tend to decline, including strength, stamina, immune system efficiency, and sensory perceptions. These declines contribute to a higher susceptibility to various illnesses, with common diseases like the flu potentially becoming more serious and life-threatening. In contrast, younger individuals, such as those in Group A, have stronger immune systems, better physical strength and capacity, and are generally healthier in various aspects. Consequently, they are at a lower risk for developing cardiovascular diseases in comparison to their older counterparts in Group B. Furthermore, older adults like those in Group B are more likely to develop conditions such as arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. This information further emphasizes the differences in the general health status of the two age groups being studied by Dr. Jones. In summary, Group A, with people under 35 years old, has a smaller chance of developing cardiovascular diseases compared to Group B, which consists of individuals over 65 years old due to the physiological changes and increased risk of health complications that occur during late adulthood."},{"question":"i decided that i hate being a girl.1 ) i hate the fact that because of hormones i ( and genes , i guess ) gain weight more than the average boy.2 ) i hate how bad i cramp during that time of the month . i am tempted to rip out my ovaries . i m nauseous and irritable.3 ) i hate how i have to do my hair and make up everyday to look the slightest bit presentable . like , why ca nt i jump out of the shower , throw on a flannel shirt , slip on a baseball cap and be ready?4 ) I WISH I HAD A PENIS TO PEE WITH .

After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails.

If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, or an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grey and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are likely to be strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us. They have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference, and the effects that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you do so as soon as you open your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. Black is while light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one does, and a red dress adds warmth and cheer to sad winter days.

We have the equation: 0 = -3202*t + 2980*t - 7326 Imagine we have -3202 toy blocks with 't' written on them and another 2980 toy blocks with 't' written on them. Our goal is to find out how many 't' blocks we need to make the whole pile equal to zero. First, we need to combine the toy blocks with 't' on them: -3202*t + 2980*t = (-3202 + 2980)*t = -222*t Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -222*t - 7326 Next, let's think of -7326 as a big candy pile. We need to add enough 't' groups of toys blocks to cancel it out. To do this, we need to divide the candy pile (-7326) by the number of toy blocks in each 't' group (-222). So, the number of 't' groups we need is: t = (-7326) / (-222) When we divide these numbers, we get: t = 33 So, we need 33 groups of 't' toy blocks to cancel out the big candy pile and make the whole pile equal to zero."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Question: The person didn't like the varying size of the cake slices handed out, she demand more what? Options: - fairness - candies - compliments - well fed - arguements Explain why a human would choose \\"fairness\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","response":"A human would choose \\"fairness\\" to answer the question above because it directly relates to the issue presented in the scenario. In the given situation, the person is dissatisfied with the varying size of the cake slices handed out, which indicates an underlying concern for equitable distribution. Let us carefully analyze the provided options to understand why \\"fairness\\" is the most suitable answer. 1. Fairness - This option is the most relevant because it addresses the core problem in the scenario. The person demands equitable treatment when it comes to the distribution of cake slices. A sense of fairness ensures that everyone receives a similar share of something, thereby reducing potential conflicts or dissatisfaction. 2. Candies - While candies are a sweet treat, they do not directly address the person's concern in this situation. The issue is not with the presence of additional treats, but with the unequal distribution of the cake slices. 3. Compliments - Compliments do not resolve the problem at hand. Although they might make the person feel better momentarily, the primary issue of unequal cake distribution persists. 4. Well fed - The term \\"well fed\\" indicates that people are adequately nourished and satisfied with their food consumption. However, it does not address the specific issue of unequal cake distribution. Instead, it focuses on the general state of being content with one's food intake. 5. Arguments - Demanding more arguments in this situation is counterproductive. Arguing does not result in a resolution or address the person's unhappiness with the unequal cake slices. On the contrary, it may escalate tensions and create an uncomfortable atmosphere. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"fairness\\" as the answer to the question because it directly tackles the problem in the scenario - the varying size of cake slices handed out. By demanding fairness, the person seeks a solution that ensures an equitable distribution of cake, promoting harmony and satisfaction among everyone present. The other options fail to address this primary concern and do not provide a logical or suitable resolution to the problem."},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Spanish.

Located on the equator, Gabon is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west. It has an area of nearly and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Cameroon, officially the Republic of Cameroon, is a country in Central Africa.

These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana is a unitary presidential constitutional democracy, located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean, in the subregion of West Africa.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England.

They raise their hands to their faces as coffins containing five British servicemen are transported slowly through Carterton, Oxon. The cortege comes to a halt as mourners pay their respects to the five servicemen who were killed. Some lay flowers on the roofs of the hearses while others stand and watch on in solemn silence. All five families of the victims threw flowers on top of the hearses, with some mourners touching the glass and hearses as they wept. As the hearses passed the Memorial Garden in Carterton, more and more tearful friends and family stepped forward with flowers to pay their respects.

L/Cpl Thomas, 26, from Brecon in Powys, Mid Wales, had volunteered for deployment to Afghanistan and arrived there in December last year. His family described him as a 'truly amazing person, living his life to the full, while fulfilling some of his many dreams and adventures'. The helicopter in which the men were travelling is believed to have been from AAC 657 Squadron, a top unit based at RAF Odiham which provides support and transport for special forces troops. The aircraft went down in the Takhta Pul district of Kandahar, in what was the worst incident involving a British military helicopter in Afghanistan since the war began there in 2001. The crash caused the third biggest single loss of life of British troops since the conflict in Afghanistan began and brought the total number of service personnel killed there to 453. The incident equalled the previous worst disaster involving a British helicopter, when a Lynx aircraft crashed in Basra City, Iraq, in May 2006 killing the five service personnel on board. Crowds pay tribute as the coffins pass the Memorial Garden in Carterton after being repatriated to nearby RAF Brize Norton. Earlier in the day a Royal Air Force aircraft arrived at RAF Brize Norton carrying the bodies of the five men. As a Union flag-covered coffin is carried past, mourners throw white and red roses on to the roof of the hearse. Mourners lined the road on Norton Way, clutching flowers including red and white roses, lilies, brightly coloured tulips and yellow daffodils. Speaking after the moving service, Lynn Little, mayor of Carterton, described the large turnout as 'tremendous'. Councillor Little, who also acts as a liaison officer for the bereaved families, said: “It was a very sad occasion but then it always is. 'We are proud of our service families and serving personnel, when something tragic like this happens the least we can do is support them on a day like today. 'There are a tremendous amount of people here today, there are around 300 Army Air Corps and then a lot of local people too. 'As mayor, I am very proud so many have come out to offer their support. 'It is something we don’t want, we wish it didn’t happen but when it does we get out here for these families.' Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: 'My thoughts go out to the friends and families of the five servicemen being repatriated at RAF Brize Norton.' Loved-ones embrace and gather their strength as they wait for the coffins to arrive from nearby RAF Brize Norton. Tearful embrace: two women comfort each other as crowds gather to pay their respects. Following the deaths of the five men, the Ministry of Defence and their families issued touching tributes. Hundreds gathered for the poignant event. Lynn Little, mayor of Carterton, described the large turnout as ¿tremendous¿.

Alongside him, Captain Thomas Clarke, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, Flight Lieutenant Rakesh Chauhan, and Lance Corporal Oliver Thomas also died in the crash. The Ministry of Defence denied Taliban claims that the helicopter was shot down, stating initial investigations indicated a tragic accident as the cause. At RAF Brize Norton, over 1,000 mourners, including serving personnel, school children, and local residents, stood in silence as the five servicemen were flown in.

Pick your answer from: * negative. * positive.","response":"The given tweet is just a single word: \\"painting!\\" The sentiment of such a tweet could be somewhat ambiguous, as it heavily depends on the context in which the tweeter posted it. This tweet does not provide much information about the tweeter's feelings or opinions. However, we can still try to analyze this word and determine the sentiment based on the assumptions we may make. Generally, the exclamation mark after the word might suggest enthusiasm, excitement, or interest on the part of the tweeter towards painting. It might show that the tweeter is enjoying painting or is excited to share their painting with others. In this sense, the sentiment could be interpreted as positive. However, it is important to understand that there's no additional context provided, and the reason behind the tweet could have been because of frustration, surprise, or simply an outburst of emotion. Therefore, it is somewhat challenging to definitively categorize the sentiment based on a one-word tweet without further context. Considering the mentioned points, if we were to choose between positive and negative, it is more likely that the sentiment of the tweet is positive, given the exclamation mark after the word, which often denotes some level of excitement or enthusiasm. So, the answer would be positive. However, it is important to keep in mind that without additional context, it is impossible to be 100% certain of the underlying sentiment."},{"question":"Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room temperature.

Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Paragraph: Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Answer:","response":"Based on the provided information, Bill, the farmer with the grasslands, would likely observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil. This is because in grasslands, precipitation is equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which causes the soil to develop in relative drought conditions. These conditions lead to decreased leaching and migration of weathering products, such as calcium. This, in turn, results in a buildup of calcium and other large cations in the upper soil profile. Furthermore, when leaching is decreased, calcium can precipitate as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, forming a caliche layer."},{"question":"Q:Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building.

Context: How to deal with annoying teachers<br>Ask them what they are looking for. If your teacher is a hard grader, try to get more details when they give an assignment. Ask if there is anything specific they are looking for, and if there's anything you should avoid. Hypothesis: It is impossible to ask a teacher a question.","response":"No, the hypothesis you mentioned, \\"It is impossible to ask a teacher a question,\\" cannot be drawn from the given context. The context actually discusses a strategy for dealing with annoying teachers, specifically those who are hard graders. It suggests an approach in which students should proactively communicate with their teachers to gain an understanding of what their expectations are when assigning tasks. This communication can help students better meet teachers' expectations and potentially prevent or mitigate any frustrations or difficulties they may face due to their teachers' grading style. The context clearly encourages students to engage in dialogue with their teachers by suggesting they ask questions about their assignments, like the specific expectations and elements that should be avoided. It does not imply any inability or impossibility to ask teachers questions. Rather, it promotes open communication with teachers as a way to build understanding and manage challenging situations in the classroom. So, a more appropriate hypothesis based on this context could be: \\"Asking a teacher about their expectations and seeking clarifications on assignments can help students better deal with annoying teachers, especially those who are hard graders.\\" This hypothesis aligns with the context's main idea and does not contradict the intentions stated in the passage."},{"question":"If \\"Great show of skill as a young man is taken down in a karate competition.\\" does that mean that \\"Great show of skill as a young men is taken down in a karate competition.\\"? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","response":"The original sentence is: \\"Great show of skill as a young man is taken down in a karate competition.\\" The modified sentence is: \\"Great show of skill as a young men is taken down in a karate competition.\\" The main difference between the two sentences is the usage of \\"young man\\" in the first sentence and \\"young men\\" in the second one. Let us examine the possible meanings of both sentences and compare them. 1. The first sentence can be interpreted as a single young man demonstrating great skill in a karate competition but ultimately being defeated. In this case, the focus is on one individual who is highly skilled but still loses the match. 2. The second sentence can be understood as a group of young men, each showing great skill in a karate competition. However, the use of \\"is\\" suggests an incorrect grammatical structure since \\"young men\\" is plural and should be followed by \\"are\\". The correct sentence should be: \\"Great show of skill as young men are taken down in a karate competition.\\" To answer the question: No, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence discusses a single young man exhibiting great skill in a karate competition and being defeated, while the second sentence, when grammatically corrected, talks about a group of young men demonstrating great skill and being defeated in a karate competition."},{"question":"Are these paraphrases?

Griffin of Terre Haute, Ind., during a casualty return at Dover Air Force Base, Del. President Donald Trump is claiming his predecessors... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — After her Army son died in an armored vehicle rollover in Syria in May, Sheila Murphy says, she got no call or letter from President Donald Trump, even as she waited months for his condolences, wrote to him to say \\"some days I don't want to live,\\" and still heard nothing. In contrast, Trump called to comfort Eddie and Aldene Lee about 10 days after their Army son was killed in an explosion while on patrol in Iraq in April. \\"Lovely young man,\\" Trump said, according to Aldene. She thought that was a beautiful word to hear about her boy, \\"lovely.\\" Like presidents before him, Trump has made personal contact with some families of the fallen, not all. What's different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over who's done better to honor the war dead and their families. He placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that \\"I think I've called every family of someone who's died\\" while past presidents didn't place such calls. But The Associated Press found relatives of two soldiers who died overseas during Trump's presidency who said they never received a call or a letter from him, as well as relatives of a third who did not get a call. And proof is plentiful that Barack Obama and George W. Bush — saddled with far more combat casualties than the roughly two dozen so far under Trump, took painstaking steps to write, call or meet bereaved military families. The subject arose because nearly two weeks passed before Trump called the families of four U.S. soldiers who were killed in Niger nearly two weeks ago. He made the calls Tuesday. Meanwhile, Rep. Frederica Wilson said late Tuesday that Trump told the widow of a slain soldier that he \\"knew what he signed up for.\\" The Florida Democrat said she was in the car with Myeshia Johnson on the way to Miami International Airport to meet the body of Johnson's husband, Sgt. La David Johnson, when Trump called. Wilson says she heard part of the conversation on speakerphone. When asked by Miami station WPLG if she indeed heard Trump say that she answered: \\"Yeah, he said that. To me, that is something that you can say in a conversation, but you shouldn't say that to a grieving widow.\\" She added: \\"That's so insensitive.\\" Sgt. Johnson was among four servicemen killed in the Niger ambush. Wilson said that she didn't hear the entire conversation and Myeshia Johnson told her she couldn't remember everything that was said. The White House didn't immediately comment Trump's delay in publicly discussing the men lost at Niger did not appear to be extraordinary, judging from past examples, but his politicization of the matter is. He went so far Tuesday as to cite the death of chief of staff John Kelly's son in Afghanistan to question whether Obama had properly honored the war dead. Kelly was a Marine general under Obama when his Marine son Robert died in 2010. \\"You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?\\" Trump said on Fox News radio. Democrats and some former government officials were livid, accusing Trump of \\"inane cruelty\\" and a \\"sick game.\\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was attacked, said: \\"I just wish that this commander in chief would stop using Gold Star families as pawns in whatever sick game he's trying to play here.\\" For their part, Gold Star families, which have lost members in wartime, told AP of acts of intimate kindness from Obama and Bush when those commanders in chief consoled them. Trump initially claimed that only he among presidents made sure to call families. Obama may have done so on occasion, he said, but \\"other presidents did not call.\\" He equivocated Tuesday as the record made plain that his characterization was false. \\"I don't know,\\" he said of past calls. But he said his own practice was to call all families of the war dead. But that hasn't happened: No White House protocol demands that presidents speak or meet with the families of Americans killed in action — an impossible task in a war's bloodiest stages. But they often do. Altogether some 6,900 Americans have been killed in overseas wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the overwhelming majority under Bush and Obama. Despite the much heavier toll on his watch — more than 800 dead each year from 2004 through 2007 — Bush wrote to all bereaved military families and met or spoke with hundreds if not thousands, said his spokesman, Freddy Ford. Veterans groups said they had no quarrel with how presidents have recognized the fallen or their families. \\"I don't think there is any president I know of who hasn't called families,\\" said Rick Weidman, co-founder and executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. \\"President Obama called often and President Bush called often. They also made regular visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Center, going in the evenings and on Saturdays.\\" ___ Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.

John F. Kelly has gone out of his way to keep the death of his son free from politics. He did not talk about him when — just four days after his death in southern Afghanistan — Kelly found himself commemorating two other Marines killed in combat, in a moving speech in St. Louis. In fact, according to a Washington Post report, he specifically asked the officer introducing him not to mention his boy, 1st Lt. Robert M. Kelly, who was killed instantly when he stepped on a land mine while on patrol in 2010. Just last month, Kelly slipped away from the White House to attend a Marine Corps scholarship golf tournament in his son’s memory, with little fanfare or attention. But on Tuesday, Kelly’s boss, President Trump, thrust his son into the public and political glare, invoking the younger Kelly as part of a continuing attack on former president Barack Obama. In an interview with Fox News radio, Trump singled out Kelly, his chief of staff, as he attempted to bolster his false claim a day earlier that Obama never called families of fallen U.S. service members. President Trump's response to the deaths of four soldiers in Niger is causing an uproar after Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla) said he told Sgt. La David Johnson's widow that her husband \\"knew what he was signing up for.\\" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) “I think I’ve called every family of someone who’s died,” the president told the host, Brian Kilmeade. “As far as other representatives, I don’t know. You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?” The remark, which was almost immediately derided by Democrats and Obama allies as politicizing a tragedy, was unplanned, said two White House officials, who said they were caught off-guard by Trump’s comments. One said Kelly may have mentioned some details surrounding his son’s death to the president in private — and the president then repeated them in public, a relatively frequent occurrence with Trump. The president’s casual assertion sent both sides scrambling to recount their own version of events — underscoring again that in Trump’s White House, almost nothing is off limits and just about anything can be used to score political points. Leon Panetta, former defense secretary under Obama and former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, said Trump’s comments were below the dignity of the office. “I just think it demeans the presidency when you use John Kelly and his son, both of whom are patriots, to back up his excuses for whatever happened,” Panetta said. “I just think it creates a sense that there is no sacred ground for this president.” A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Kelly did not receive a call from Obama at the time. But in May 2011, Obama hosted a breakfast for Gold Star families — those who had lost a family member who was in uniform — and Kelly and his wife attended, according to White House records. Heather Kelly is enveloped in a goodbye hug from her father-in-law, Lt. Gen. John F. Kelly, as she leaves after a visit to his home in 2011. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) A person familiar with the event said the couple were seated at then-first lady Michelle Obama’s table. A former Obama White House official, meanwhile, flatly rebutted Trump’s initial claim that Obama never — he later backpedaled to suggest rarely — called families of military lost during his administration. “President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to Section 60 at Arlington, visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star families at the White House and across the country,” the official said. Kelly, who became the highest-ranking military official to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan, watched both his sons follow him into the Marine Corps. When Robert died, Kelly and his sons had participated in 11 combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. But Kelly has been private about his son’s death, even though both his and his sons’ military service clearly informs his thinking on White House foreign policy and national security decisions, which to him are not merely intellectual exercises, several White House officials said. Kelly has previously resisted White House efforts to link children’s deaths with politics and policy. Earlier this year, when Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to establish the VOICE office — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement — Kelly, then the homeland security secretary, at the rollout of the office tried to push back internally against efforts to highlight “angel” moms and families whose kids were killed by undocumented immigrants, one department official said. The families were featured at the event but did not have a speaking role. The official said Kelly is very sensitive to his son’s death being politicized, and recoils at attempts to politicize parents and families in this manner. Still, Kelly has spoken publicly about his son before. He participated in the 2011 Washington Post profile, largely, he said, to highlight the lives and challenges of military families. Even then, however, his reticence emerged. When first approached about the story, he replied in an email: “We are only one of 5,500 American families who have suffered the loss of a child in this war. The death of my boy simply cannot be made to seem any more tragic than the others.” Since joining Trump’s West Wing team, Kelly is almost always at the president’s side for public appearances. But he was notably absent Tuesday from a Rose Garden news conference with Trump and the Greek prime minister. The White House offered no explanation of why Kelly was not in attendance. Anne Gearan, David Nakamura and Philip Rucker contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","response":"This article talks about how President Donald Trump has called some families of soldiers who died during his time as president, but not all of them.

Sentence 1: 1. Long leather apron 2. White stulp gloves 3. An axe with a handle mounted on a brass Sentence 2: 1. Long leather apron 2. White gauntlet gloves 3. An axe with a brass mounted handle Now let's compare the elements: 1. Both sentences mention a long leather apron, so this part of the meaning is the same in both sentences. 2. Sentence 1 mentions \\"white stulp gloves,\\" whereas Sentence 2 mentions \\"white gauntlet gloves.\\" Stulp gloves are typically simple gloves without wrist-length cuffs. Gauntlet gloves, on the other hand, are a type of protective glove with a flared wrist-length cuff. While both types of gloves have some similarities, their specific designs may differ. In this case, there might be some differences in the meaning of these elements. 3. At first glance, the description of the axe in both sentences might seem to have the same meaning. However, there is a subtle difference. Sentence 1 mentions \\"an axe with a handle mounted on a brass,\\" whereas Sentence 2 says, \\"an axe with a brass mounted handle.\\" In the first sentence, the wording implies that the handle is mounted on a separate piece of brass. In contrast, the second sentence suggests that the handle itself has brass fixtures or elements. Thus, there is a slight difference in meaning. After comparing the above-mentioned elements, we can conclude that the two sentences do not have the exact same meaning.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","response":"If the magma rises less, it will likely result in fewer or less intense eruptions. The reduced rise of magma means that there will be less pressure building up within the magma chambers, which lowers the overall energy that could potentially lead to an eruption. Consequently, this perturbation would lead to a decrease in both the number and the power of eruptions. The second effect mentioned, the influence on explosive versus slow-moving eruptions, would also be impacted. With less magma rising, there is a greater likelihood that any eruptions that do occur will be slower, low-pressure flows of magma, rather than explosive events.

How are chocolate raw materials obtained and how is chocolate made? How is chocolate made?","response":"No, the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the chocolate-making process. Let me explain the difference between the two questions and provide detailed information for each. Question 1: How are chocolate raw materials obtained and how is chocolate made? This question is asking for information about two distinct stages in the chocolate-making process. First, it looks at how the raw materials for chocolate are obtained, and secondly, it delves into the actual process of making chocolate. 1. Obtaining raw materials: The primary raw material for making chocolate is the cacao bean, which is the seed of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). Cacao trees are grown in tropical regions, with the majority of production taking place in West Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. Here is the process of obtaining raw materials for chocolate: a. Harvesting: Cacao pods, which contain cacao beans, are harvested by hand from the cacao tree. This is usually done twice a year during the main and mid-crop harvests. b. Fermentation: The cacao beans are removed from the pods and placed in fermentation boxes or heaps, covered with banana leaves. The fermentation process, which usually takes about five to seven days, is vital for developing the chocolate's flavor profile. c. Drying: After fermentation, the beans are spread out on drying racks or platforms and left to dry in the sun. The drying process ensures that the beans do not mold or rot. It can take up to a week for the cacao beans to dry, after which they are inspected and sorted. d. Roasting: Once the cacao beans have been dried and cleaned, they are roasted to bring out the characteristic chocolate flavor. Roasting temperatures and times vary, depending on the desired flavor profile. 2. Making chocolate: The process of making chocolate involves several steps that transform the prepared cacao beans into a delicious final product. a. Grinding: Roasted cacao beans are ground into a paste called chocolate liquor. The grinding process generates heat, which melts the cocoa butter present in the beans, resulting in a smooth liquid. b. Separation: The chocolate liquor is further processed using pressing machines to separate the cocoa solids from the cocoa butter. This separation results in two products: cocoa powder and cocoa butter. c. Conching: Chocolate makers then mix cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and other ingredients such as sugar, milk powder (for milk chocolate), and vanilla, in a conching machine. This machine refines the texture and flavor of the chocolate, resulting in a smoother product. d. Tempering: The chocolate mixture is then tempered, which involves heating and cooling it to specific temperatures. This process ensures that the chocolate forms the right crystal structure, giving it a shiny appearance and a nice snap when broken. e. Molding: Finally, the tempered chocolate is poured into molds, where it cools and hardens into the desired shape. The chocolate can also be made into various products like chocolate bars, truffles, or confections. Question 2: How is chocolate made? This question only asks for information about the process of making chocolate, starting from the point where the raw materials have already been obtained. In this case, you can focus solely on the steps mentioned in the \\"making chocolate\\" section above (Steps 2a-2e). In summary, while the first question is looking for comprehensive information about the entire chocolate production process from raw material sourcing to the final product, the second question is focused on the specific steps involved in making chocolate from the obtained raw materials."},{"question":"Choose from the options at the end.

Here's what pundits say this means for the GOP nomination race: \\"The loss raises the possibility that Mr. Trump's strength is at least partly an illusion; he may not be quite as strong as he looks,\\" writes Nate Cohn at the New York Times. A long, three-way fight probably lies ahead, and Cruz now appears to have \\"a narrow but real path\\" to the nomination, involving success in Southern states after next week's New Hampshire primary, he writes. Rubio's third-place finish is great news for the GOP establishment seeking a clear alternative to both Cruz and Trump, Eli Stokols writes at Politico. Going into New Hampshire, Rubio is on the \\"sharpest upward trajectory while his two rivals, despite finishing ahead of him, are seeing their support tick down in recent weeks as the result of unrelenting attacks between them,\\" he writes. For the \\"Trump blimp,\\" we will soon find out whether this is \\"a small leak that he can patch over in plenty of time for New Hampshire or whether it's a catastrophic hole that will bring the whole enterprise down,\\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post, noting that it's bad news for Trump that the latter scenario is even being discussed. More bad news for Trump: Analysts had predicted that he would win if there was a high turnout in Iowa, but his loss came amid a record-breaking turnout of around 180,000 GOP caucus-goers, up 60,000 people from the record set in 2012, the Des Moines Register reports. Trump congratulated Cruz in what CNN describes as a \\"short but gracious\\" speech. \\"We will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie,\\" he told supporters. \\"We finished second, and I have to say I am just honored.\\" Cruz, meanwhile, was still on the offensive, saying the result \\"sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment.\\" Cruz and his campaign \\"invested considerable time and money to grind out a victory in this key state, and they were ultimately rewarded for their efforts,\\" notes Anthony Zurcher at the BBC, who predicts that while Trump will no doubt remain a factor, the next big showdown will be between Cruz and Rubio. Expand this summary.","response":"In the Iowa caucus, Ted Cruz won and Donald Trump came in second place, with Marco Rubio very close to Trump. Some people think this means that Trump might not be as strong as he looks. Cruz now has more chances to win in the Southern states after the next event in New Hampshire. Rubio coming in third place is good news for the Republican Party, because he is seen as a better choice than Cruz or Trump. We have to wait and see how this affects Trump's chances in New Hampshire, but many people are talking about if this is a big problem for him. In Iowa, a lot of people voted, which was supposed to be good for Trump, but he still lost. Trump is still saying that he thinks he can win the Republican nomination and beat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Cruz said that the results show that the media and the politicians in Washington won't be choosing the next president.

I don't understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. Yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. I don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it is. This TV movie was charming. An old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves pull it off. One reviewer found Riffen far to old. I would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. It is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I also think it is about the best thing Reeves ever did.

Belly fat can make your hips look smaller by comparison. Losing weight overall can cut down on belly fat, and make your hips look bigger. To lose weight, the first step is a healthy diet. Your diet should be primarily plant-based. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should make up the bulk of your diet. Go for brown rice over white rice, and whole wheat breads over white varieties. Stick to lean forms of protein, like fish and poultry, and low fat dairy products. For example, go for salmon for dinner instead of steak. Sugar can contribute to weight gain overall, so look into cutting back on sugar in your diet. Sugary beverages can be a big culprit, as many people fail to think about liquid calories in their diet. Avoid sugary beverages like soda, specialty latte drinks, and alcoholic beverages including cocktails, wine, beer, and wine coolers. Drink plenty of water instead and opt for unsweetened beverages like unsweetened iced tea and club soda. You can even flavor water and other zero calorie beverages with lemon or lime juice. Read labels before making a purchase. Sugar is found in surprising places, like breads, yogurts, and pasta sauces. You should also look for words like fructose, dextrose, and maltose in the ingredients list. These are all names of added sugar. For women, strive to limit added sugar to 24 grams a day, which is about 6 teaspoons. For men, limit added sugar to 36 grams, which is about 9 teaspoons. Many times, you are eating more calories than you realize. Portion sizes, especially when eating out, can be quite large. Be conscientious of portion size. Try to avoid going out to eat. When you do, split an entree with a friend to halve the calories. If a restaurant has a special menu of low calorie foods, try ordering off of that. Be aware of how much food you should eat at home. One serving of carbohydrates is about the size of a hockey puck. An ounce of dairy is about the size of six dice. A serving of protein should be no bigger than a deck of cards. It can also help to eat slowly. Your body will feel more satisfied, and you will realize you're full quicker. It can be helpful to keep a record of your eating habits, any weight loss you have, and any inches you lose off of your waist. This can help you stay on track and see what days of the week you're likely to slip up. It can also keep you motivated to have a running log of your progress to look at each day. You should also be sure to include other factors that can affect weight loss. For example, note things like your stress level, your sleep schedule, and your daily exercise.

(The full records are available here.) The results should be troubling for anyone who cares about privacy rights, judicial oversight of police activities, and the rule of law. The documents paint a detailed picture of police using an invasive technology — one that can follow you inside your house — in many hundreds of cases and almost entirely in secret. The secrecy is not just from the public, but often from judges who are supposed to ensure that police are not abusing their authority. Partly relying on that secrecy, police have been getting authorization to use Stingrays based on the low standard of “relevance,” not a warrant based on probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment. Records Show Widespread Stingray Use Last year, we sent public records requests to three dozen police and sheriffs’ departments in Florida seeking information about their use of Stingrays, also called “cell cite simulators” because they mimic cell phone towers and force phones in the area to broadcast information that can be used to identify and locate them. The records we obtained document millions of dollars spent purchasing the technology and show their use in many hundreds of investigations in every corner of the state. As we revealed last year, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has spent more than 3 million on Stingrays and related equipment since 2008. But it isn’t keeping the technology to itself. The FDLE has signed agreements with at least 11 local and regional law enforcement agencies allowing them to use the FDLE’s Stingrays and to share them with neighboring jurisdictions. (Though the version of the sharing agreement released by the FDLE is partially redacted, a local police department near Tampa provided an unredacted copy.) Use of the FDLE’s Stingrays has been extensive. In a May 2014 email, the FDLE identified a staggering 1,835 uses of cell site simulator equipment, likely reflecting deployment in both state and local investigations throughout Florida. The Tallahassee Police Department (TPD) provided the most extensive information about a local agency’s use of Stingrays on loan from the FDLE, including a detailed list of more than 250 investigations in which it used Stingrays from September 2007 through February 2014. Although law enforcement agencies often justify their purchase of Stingrays—and the excessive secrecy surrounding their use — on homeland security grounds, the Tallahassee list reveals not a single national security-related investigation. Robbery, burglary, and theft investigations represent nearly a third of the total, followed by “wanted person” investigations, and then a laundry list of other run-of-the-mill offenses. The list also shows that the TPD allowed other police departments to access Stingrays, even crossing state lines into Georgia on at least five occasions. Technology Hidden From the Courts In many of the investigations, police never sought a court order authorizing Stingray use. In others, they sought a court order on a low \\"relevance\\" standard, but not a warrant based on probable cause. Perhaps most troublingly, the records indicate a pattern of excessive secrecy, including concealment of information that should appear in investigative files and court filings. For example, the TPD provided a sample of judicial applications and orders it says were used to justify Stingray use, but not one of them contains a single mention or description of Stingray technology. This suggests that judges weren’t being fully informed about what they were approving. The TPD also released the full investigative files from 11 cases where the agency used Stingrays.* But officers’ notes and other documentation in the files never once mention Stingrays or provide descriptions of their use. Instead, there are only fleeting references that would likely be inscrutable to a defense attorney or judge not already on the lookout for signs of covert Stingray surveillance. Two files mention use of “electronic surveillance measures” to track a cell phone. Another says only that “Confidential intelligence” indicated the location of a phone. A fourth states that “Inv Corbett [sic] arrived and determined that [the tracked] telephone was on the second floor of the apartment.” We know from a court transcript that the ACLU successfully petitioned to unseal last year that Corbitt is the TPD officer who operates Stingrays for the department. The Tallahassee Police aren’t alone in obfuscating references to Stingray use in case files and court documents. As we have previously reported, for example, police in the Sarasota area were instructed by the U.S. Marshals Service to eliminate descriptions of Stingray cell phone tracking in court filings and replace them with the cryptic phrase “received information from a confidential source regarding the location of the suspect.” A new Washington Post article, based partly on the records obtained by the ACLU, provides further detail about how Stingray secrecy functions — and malfunctions — in Tallahassee. In one case detailed by the Post, prosecutors opted to offer a defendant a no-jail plea deal instead of revealing details about the Stingray as part of court-ordered pre-trial discovery. As we’ve seen elsewhere in the country, our justice system can’t properly function when judges and defense attorneys are kept in the dark about covert electronic surveillance by police. Excessive Secrecy Persists Below we detail our findings about Stingray use in other departments across the state, including records showing hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures and information on the number of cases in which they have been used. But for all these disclosures, many details about Stingray use in Florida are still shrouded in secrecy. Several agencies refused to comply with Florida's open records laws by properly providing documents. Some acknowledged that they had responsive records, but refused to release them. The Brevard County Sheriff’s Office, for example, denied our records request in full, partly relying on a “non-disclosure agreement or requirement” with a “federal agency.” (We know the FBI has been making local agencies sign non-disclosure agreements before buying Stingrays; a fully redacted copy of the FBI agreement is likely contained in the pages released by the FDLE. The FDLE also released a copy of a non-disclosure agreement with the Harris Corporation.) The Sheriffs’ Offices in Broward and Pinellas Counties issued similar denials. Police Departments in Pembroke Pines and Port St. Lucie failed to respond to the ACLU’s request at all. Other agencies tried to withhold records, but apparently forgot that they had already released documents on the web. The Miami Police Department responded only that it had “No departmental orders or standard operating procedures covering ‘cell site simulators,’” but did not reply to a follow-up request for other kinds of records. Documents posted on the city’s website, however, show that Miami spent tens of thousands of dollars buying and upgrading Stingrays in 2008. And in the City of Sunrise, the police at first refused to confirm or deny whether any responsive records existed. After the ACLU pointed out that Sunrise had already posted purchase records for Stingray devices on its public website, the city saw fit to send the ACLU copies of those already-publicly available documents . . . and a request for 20,000 to cover the expense of searching for additional records. Unanswered Questions Not a single department produced any policies or guidelines governing use of Stingrays or restricting how and when they could be deployed, suggesting a lack of internal oversight. And no department provided evidence that it gets warrants before using the technology. Indeed, records from Tallahassee and elsewhere indicate that police have not been getting warrants. That must change. In a strong ruling last year, the Florida Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment requires police to get a warrant before asking a phone company to track a cell phone user’s location in real time. The logic of that opinion should apply equally to cell phone tracking using Stingrays. And because Stingrays sweep up information not just about suspects, but also bystanders, the need for robust judicial oversight is all the greater. The documents we obtained add to the growing picture of surreptitious Stingray surveillance by local police around the country. By shining a light on police practices, we hope to help bring constitutional violations and a culture of impunity to an end. Details on Stingray Use by Departments Across Florida Records from elsewhere in Florida show how use of the technology and secrecy about it has proliferated. Following is what we found about particular departments across the state: * In consideration of the privacy interests of people named in the investigative files produced by several law enforcement agencies, we are releasing only those pages of the files that shed light on Stingray use, and are redacting personally identifiable information. ||||| The Berkshire Manor Apartments in Tallahassee, one location where the StingRay surveillance device was used extensively by the Tallahassee Police Department. (Phil Sears/AP) The case against Tadrae McKenzie looked like an easy win for prosecutors. He and two buddies robbed a small-time pot dealer of 130 worth of weed using BB guns. Under Florida law, that was robbery with a deadly weapon, with a sentence of at least four years in prison. But before trial, his defense team detected investigators’ use of a secret surveillance tool, one that raises significant privacy concerns. In an unprecedented move, a state judge ordered the police to show the device — a cell-tower simulator sometimes called a StingRay — to the attorneys. Rather than show the equipment, the state offered McKenzie a plea bargain. Today, 20-year-old McKenzie is serving six months’ probation ­after pleading guilty to a second-degree misdemeanor. He got, as one civil liberties advocate said, the deal of the century. (The other two defendants also pleaded guilty and were sentenced to two years’ probation.) McKenzie’s case is emblematic of the growing, but hidden, use by local law enforcement of a sophisticated surveillance technology borrowed from the national security world. It shows how a gag order imposed by the FBI — on grounds that discussing the device’s operation would compromise its effectiveness — has left judges, the public and criminal defendants in the dark on how the tool works. That secrecy, in turn, has hindered debate over whether the StingRay’s use respects Americans’ civil liberties. “It’s a terrible violation of our constitutional rights,” asserted Elaine Harper, McKenzie’s grandmother, who raised the young man. “People need to know — the public needs to know — what’s going on.” The StingRay is a box about the size of a small suitcase — there’s also a handheld version — that simulates a cellphone tower. It elicits signals from all mobile phones in its vicinity. That means it collects information not just about a criminal suspect’s communications but also about the communications of potentially hundreds of law-abiding citizens. The Tallahassee police used the StingRay or a similar device in more than 250 investigations over a six-year period, from mid-2007 through early 2014, according to a list of cases compiled by the Tallahassee Police Department and provided to the American Civil Liberties Union. That’s 40 or so instances a year in a city of 186,000, a surprisingly high rate given that the StingRay’s manufacturer, Harris Corp., has told the Federal Communications Commission that the device is used only in emergencies. At least 48 state and local law enforcement agencies in 20 states and the District of Columbia have bought the devices, according to the ACLU. The secrecy surrounding the device’s use has begun to prompt a backlash in cities across the country. In Baltimore, a judge is pushing back against the refusal of police officers to answer questions while testifying. In Charlotte, following a newspaper investigation, the state’s attorney is reviewing whether prosecutors ­illegally withheld information about the device’s use from defendants. In Tacoma, Wash., after a separate newspaper investigation found that judges in almost 200 cases had no idea they were issuing orders for the StingRay, the courts set new rules requiring police to disclose the tool’s use. The state legislature is weighing a bill to regulate police use of the equipment. The FBI and Tallahassee police say that the device is used only with an appropriate court order and that they do not collect the content of calls or text messages. The FBI also said it retains only location data that is relevant to an investigation and immediately discards all other data. So far, there is virtually no case law on how the Fourth Amendment — which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures — should apply to this technology. Pot purchase gone wrong The robbery, judging from police reports, legal documents and interviews, was small-time. At about 6 p.m. on March 4, 2013, McKenzie, then 18, and two friends met a young man named Jamal Williams at a local Taco Bell. They had set up a deal to buy some marijuana from Williams, whom McKenzie had first met at a party, with the intent of robbing him of the dope. During the robbery, one of McKenzie’s buddies pulled what appeared to be a 9mm handgun out of his pocket, pointed it at Williams and demanded “everything you got.” The other friend removed what looked to be a shotgun from the trunk of a car and leveled it at Williams. “I’m not scared to put a hole in you,” he said, Williams recalled. Both weapons were BB guns. But they scared Williams enough that he gave the men the pot, left behind his iPhone and fled in a car driven by a friend who had escorted him to the Taco Bell. That evening, Williams reported to police that he had been robbed of cash and his phone when he tried to buy marijuana from some dealers he did not know. Later he admitted that he, in fact, was the seller and assessed the stolen pot’s value at 130. The police had little to go on beyond vague descriptions of the three men, a license-plate number and a cellphone number that McKenzie had provided. A check of the tag number turned up nothing. McKenzie had not given his real name. The day after the robbery, the police obtained a court order from a judge to authorize Verizon to hand over data collected from cell towers that would show the approximate locations where the phone in question had been used. Two days after the robbery, shortly after 4 a.m., several police officers drove to a house at 3197 Springhill Rd., on the south side of town, and set up surveillance. About 6 a.m., McKenzie left the house, got into his car and pulled away. The officers tailed him past Sam’s Tires and Repairs, past the Family Dollar store, past Jerusalem Baptist Church, past Tony’s Gas. Three and a half miles later, they pulled him over. The youth, a senior looking to graduate, had been on his way to school, which began at 6:45 a.m. The police found some marijuana and zip-top bags in the car. They detained McKenzie and took him to the police station. He confessed, giving police the names of his two friends and showing investigators where they lived. All three were charged with robbery with a deadly weapon. Tracing a phone’s location Months passed. The case dragged along. In November 2013, after McKenzie’s original lawyer dropped out, his case was assigned to a public defender, Carrie McMullen. Around that time, the attorney for one of the co-defendants began to wonder: How did the police figure out that McKenzie was at 3197 Springhill Rd. that morning? McMullen’s office hired a lawyer with technology expertise. John Sawicki, the expert, produced a map on which he plotted all the locations provided by Verizon, and they clumped in three different areas of town. Cell-tower data can show general geographical areas where a phone was used, but “they will not tell you he’s in House X,” Sawicki said. “That’s how imprecise it is.” In March, the defense team deposed police investigator Robert Newberry. The lawyers tried to get Newberry to explain how the police zeroed in on 3197 Springhill Rd. He mentioned the cell-tower records and then, under probing, acknowledged that they had not been sufficient on their own to locate the suspect. He said a “Sergeant Corbitt” in the department’s technical operations unit had identified the phone’s location. “He would have to tell you how he got to that,” Newberry said, referring to Christopher Corbitt, who handles electronic surveillance operations. There were other questions about whether the police had reasonable suspicion to pull McKenzie over. The descriptions Williams gave of the suspects were vague, and in fact, none closely matched McKenzie’s appearance. The descriptions fit “two-thirds of the young black males living on the south side of town,” Sawicki said. Newberry could not fully explain how Corbitt determined the phone’s location. “I can’t address it because I don’t know the magic behind it,” he said. In April, the defense team deposed Corbitt. He told the attorneys that he turned up the address on Springhill Road by running phone numbers that the suspect’s phone had dialed through a subscription database, called Accurint, that helps law enforcement agencies locate individuals through data such as phone numbers, property records and court records. But how did he know that the phone was in the house at 6 in the morning? The phone was a “burner” — one not registered under McKenzie’s name. “We do have specific equipment that allows us to . . . direction-find on the handset, if necessary,” Corbitt said. “What is that, and how does that work?” McMullen asked. “I can’t go into that,” he said. “Due to [a] nondisclosure agreement with the FBI, we’re not able to get into the details of how the equipment operates.” He acknowledged that the device was a cell-tower simulator. He also acknowledged that the device, whose model name he could not give, was used to “assist in locating or determining the person in possession” of the cellphone, and that it could elicit signals from a target’s phone even when the phone was not in use. “It is not nearly as invasive or as sinister as it is sometimes characterized to be,” he said. “I so wish that I could tell you how this equipment operates, because I think I could put so many people at ease,” Corbitt said. “Unfortunately, I am not able to do that.” He said that if the defense wanted more specific information, then he had “a specific protocol” to follow requiring him to notify the FBI and the Justice Department. The Tallahassee police declined to comment for this article. ‘100 percent’ reliable In June, in response to a motion for public access by the ACLU, the state released a transcript from a closed court hearing in 2010 relating to a Tallahassee rape case in which Corbitt testified that he had used a cell-site simulator to identify a suspect in an apartment complex. “In essence, we emulate a cellphone tower,” he said. “We force that handset to register with us. We identify that we have the correct handset and then we’re able to — by just merely direction-finding on the signal emanating from that handset — we’re able to determine a location.” He noted that the equipment “is evaluating all the handsets in the area.” “Using portable equipment,” he said, “we were able to actually basically stand at every door and every window in that complex and determine, with relative certainty . . . the particular area of the apartment that that handset was emanating from.” He said the Tallahassee police began using the device in the spring of 2007. From that point until August 2010, he said, the police had used it “200 or more times” to locate a cellphone. How reliable was it? “Truthfully,” he said, “100 percent.” In September, McMullen drew up a motion to suppress the evidence obtained against McKenzie prior to his arrest, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the use of the StingRay. She argued that the police had not obtained a warrant based on probable cause to use the device. “By scooping up all manner of information from a target cellphone, as well as nearly all cellphones in the general area, a StingRay device engages in exploratory rummaging,” she wrote. McMullen also argued that the order the police did obtain not only failed to meet the requirements of a warrant but was also obtained without telling the judge that it would be used to operate a StingRay. Then, in October, McMullen sought a subpoena to compel Corbitt to show the device in court. In November, Florida Circuit Court Judge Frank Sheffield held a hearing on the issue. The state’s attorney, Courtney Frazier, argued that details of the equipment’s operation were protected from disclosure under a law enforcement exception to the state open-records law. Sheffield broke in. “What right does law enforcement have to hide behind the rules and to listen in and take people’s information like the NSA?” he said. Frazier protested that the information about the device was sensitive and that disclosure could inhibit the police’s ability to catch criminals. “Inhibiting law enforcement’s rights are second to protecting mine!” Sheffield thundered, gesturing with both hands and fixing his gaze on the prosecutor. On Dec. 2, Sheffield signed the subpoena forcing Tallahassee police to show the device they used. Two days before Corbitt was due to show up with the device, McMullen received notice of the plea deal from the prosecutor. She had never gotten such a sweet deal on a case. The defense attorneys were disappointed that they would not see the device, but they couldn’t refuse the plea bargain. “How do you not take it?” Sawicki said. “How do you take these kids’ future away?” Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","response":"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has released records obtained from law enforcement agencies across Florida about their acquisition and use of cell phone location tracking devices known as \\"Stingrays\\". The records show that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has spent more than 3 million on Stingrays and related equipment since 2008 and has signed agreements with at least 11 local and regional law enforcement agencies allowing them to use Stingrays. However, in many cases, police never sought a court order authorizing Stingray use, and only sought a court order on a low \\"relevance\\" standard, not a warrant based on probable cause. The records also indicate that information about Stingray use is often concealed in investigative files and court filings.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

As a dedicated and hardworking individual, Jason relies on coffee as an essential part of his daily routine to maximize his performance and stay alert, particularly during long hours of work or study. Leslie, on the other hand, either doesn't share the same affinity for coffee or may have other personal reasons or lifestyle choices that affect her decision not to consume it in the same manner as Jason. Perhaps Leslie might be more sensitive to caffeine and may experience adverse side effects such as increased anxiety, jitteriness, or insomnia. It could also be that Leslie prefers alternative methods or beverages to stay energized, like herbal teas or natural energy-boosting supplements. Furthermore, it's possible that Leslie's dietary preferences or restrictions limit her consumption of coffee. Those who follow specific diets, like paleo, keto, or vegan, might choose not to drink coffee due to the potential additional caloric intake from added sugars, creamers, and sweeteners, or the presence of animal-derived ingredients in certain additives. Leslie may also be aware of medical conditions such as acid reflux, which could be aggravated by coffee, or may simply not enjoy the taste or aroma of it. Additionally, Leslie might prioritize physical activity or regular breaks during the day to recharge and maintain her energy levels naturally, rather than relying on caffeine. This could be in the form of exercise, meditation, or engaging in a hobby to refresh her mind and body. In any case, Jason's decision to consume 4 cups of coffee every day stems from his belief that it's an effective way to boost his overall performance and stay actively engaged in his daily tasks.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: 1). no; 2). yes;","response":"First question: Is self-love selfish? To determine whether self-love is selfish, it is necessary to understand the concept of self-love and selfishness. Self-love refers to the practice of taking care of one's own wellbeing, showing compassion to oneself, and recognizing the essential worth and value of oneself as a person. It is about prioritizing one's mental, emotional, and physical health. Selfishness, on the other hand, is characterized by a lack of consideration for others, being concerned primarily with one's interests or welfare at the expense of others. It's important to note that self-love is not inherently selfish. Self-love does not entail disregarding or dismissing the needs and feelings of others, but rather, it means being responsible for our well-being and understanding our value. In fact, understanding and practicing self-love makes us better equipped to establish stronger relationships with others and be more compassionate towards their feelings and experiences. A healthy level of self-love also enables us to set boundaries, which is essential in preventing ourselves from getting engulfed by the needs of others, compromising our mental and emotional health. Second question: Is love selfish or selfless? Love is a complex concept that can manifest in different forms, such as romantic love, familial love, or love for friends. Love can be both selfish and selfless, or, ideally, a balanced mix of both. Selfish love may involve prioritizing one's own needs, desires, or feelings above those of the other person. While some level of self-interest is natural and necessary in any relationship, excessive selfishness can become problematic and harmful. If love becomes possessive or controlling, or if the wellbeing of one person is consistently put above the other(s), this indicates that the love has turned predominantly selfish. Selfless love, on the other hand, refers to putting the needs, wants, and feelings of others above our own. It involves giving and caring without expecting anything in return. However, too much selflessness may not be healthy, as total disregard for personal needs can lead to feelings of resentment or loss of self-identity over time. Ideally, love should maintain a balance of selfishness and selflessness, where both parties prioritize and respect the needs of each other. The most successful and fulfilling relationships allow for a mutual exchange of care, compassion, and consideration. Are these two questions asking the same thing? The answer is 2). yes. Despite the differences between self-love and love for others, the questions \\"Is self-love selfish?\\" and \\"Is love selfish or selfless?\\" share a common theme. Both questions fundamentally explore whether love, be it for oneself or others, should be entirely selfless or if it's acceptable and healthy to maintain some level of self-interest. As discussed, a balanced and nuanced approach is essential for both self-love and love for others, suggesting that the two questions are indeed asking the same thing."},{"question":"Question: The crab was when it saw something in the kitchen, what did it see?

The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

Led by frontman Crispian Mills, the band came to prominence during the Post-Britpop era of the late 1990s. The band enjoyed commercial success in the UK between 1996 and 1999, notching up a number of Top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart, including \\"Tattva\\", \\"Hey Dude\\", \\"Govinda\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"Sound of Drums\\". The band's debut album, K, reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The origin of Kula Shaker can be traced back to 1988 when Crispian Mills (grandson of Sir John Mills and son of actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting) met Alonza Bevan at Richmond upon Thames College in South-West London. The two went on to play together in a band named Objects of Desire, formed later that year. The band's initial line-up consisted of Mills on lead guitar, Bevan on bass, Marcus French (aka Frog) on drums, Leigh Morris on rhythm guitar, and Marcus Maclaine (then Hayley Mills' boyfriend) on lead vocals. In 1991, Paul Winterhart joined the band, replacing French on drums. During this period, Crispian and Alonza were also responsible for running the Mantra Shack, a psychedelic nightclub at the back of Richmond ice rink, and consequently, the Objects of Desire would often perform at the venue. The Objects of Desire disbanded acrimoniously in early 1993, after which, Mills went on a spiritual pilgrimage, backpacking around India. The trip had a profound effect on the guitarist, fostering a deep interest in Indian culture and Hinduism. Upon returning to the UK he formed a new band named The Kays, with Bevan, Winterhart, and Mills' cousin Saul Dismont (son of the Bermudan politician Russell Dismont) on vocals. The band's debut live performance was at the 1993 Glastonbury Festival. Within a year, Dismont had left the band, only to be replaced by organist Jay Darlington, who had previously been a member of several mod revival bands. After two years of touring and recording, The Kays elected to change their name and musical direction. In May 1995, Mills suggested that the band take the name Kula Shaker, in honour of one of the twelve Alvars (saints of south India), the ninth-century Indian emperor and holy man, King Kulashekhara. In Indian culture, the name Kulashekhara is thought to be lucky or auspicious, and this appealed to the struggling band. Mills also posited that Kula Shaker's music should follow a more spiritual and mystical direction in future, in line with his own growing interest in the philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. This new emphasis on Indian mysticism and instrumentation, dovetailed with the Beatlesque, 1960s derived influences already present in the band's music, to create a sound heavily indebted to 1960s psychedelia. What kind of music did they play?","response":"Kula Shaker is an English band that plays psychedelic rock music. This type of music is inspired by the sounds from the 1960s and is mixed with Indian mysticism and instruments. They create a special sound that is heavily influenced by the 1960s' psychedelic style."},{"question":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: farmer carrying harvested tobacco leaves in a basket on shoulders until his wooden cart","response":"The most important words in this sentence are: farmer, carrying, harvested, tobacco leaves, basket, shoulders, wooden cart.

Cincinnati scored first on a 22-yard TD pass to wide receiver Kelley Washington from Carson Palmer. The Browns responded with a 30-yard FG by kicker Phil Dawson. The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson. In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns. Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach. The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain. Center Rich Braham also suffered a leg injury, and was expected to be out for some weeks. Wide receiver, Chad Johnson appeared dinged up too. On his 8-yard touchdown reception, he appeared to have an injured shoulder (made noticeable by his unenthusiastic post-score celebratory dance). Even though he continued to play, he appeared to be in pain. Later in the game, during a Browns interception, he was blocked by a Brown's safety, which gave him a concussion.

Both sentences discuss the same subject matter: the action of conmen using deceptive appearances, specifically dressed as women, to commit their crimes. This main theme is central to both sentences, making them largely similar. Sentence 1, \\"Conmen dressed as women steal cash,\\" is a short, concise statement. It outlines a crime committed by conmen, who dress as women to steal money. However, the victims, the location, or the proof are left unspecified. Sentence 2, \\"CCTV: York conmen dress as women to trick pensioners,\\" provides more specific details about the same subject. It adds that there is CCTV footage of the incident. It also places the conmen in a specific location (York) and reveals the victims of the crime (pensioners). This sentence contains the same base information as the first one but offers additional knowledge about the circumstances of the crime. However, the slight differences in the specificity of the details mentioned in the second statement (CCTV footage, location, and specific victims, which are pensioners) are what pushes the similarity rating down from a perfect 5 to a 4. While the core theme of each sentence is identical, the particulars mentioned in the second sentence are not available in the first. Additionally, the action \\"steal cash\\" in the first sentence is slightly different from \\"trick pensioners\\" in the second; both indicate a con but don't necessarily involve the same methods, leading to a slight reduction in the overall similarity.

They are considered the founding fathers of the Israelites and significant to understanding the history and development of these faiths. There are four primary patriarchs in the Old Testament, which include Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. 1. Abraham: Abraham (originally called Abram) is the first of the four patriarchs and is often referred to as the father of three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He was born in the city of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and lived around 2000 BCE. His life story is found mainly in the book of Genesis, chapters 11-25. According to the Old Testament, God called Abraham to leave his homeland and go to the land of Canaan, which God promised to give to him and his descendants. This promise, known as the Abrahamic Covenant, is foundational to the Israelite's understanding of their relationship with God. Abraham demonstrated his faith and obedience to God in various situations, including the willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac upon God's command (later stopped by God). This faith and relationship with God form the basis of his importance as a patriarch. 2. Isaac: Isaac is the second patriarch and the only son of Abraham and his wife Sarah. His birth was considered miraculous, as Sarah was beyond childbearing age when he was born, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. His life story is found mainly in the book of Genesis, chapters 21-28. Isaac's significance comes from being the heir to the Abrahamic Covenant. He married Rebekah, and they had twin sons named Esau and Jacob. Isaac favored Esau, the elder son, while Rebekah favored Jacob. In a pivotal moment, Jacob, with his mother's help, deceived Isaac into giving him the blessing meant for Esau. This act marked the transition of the covenant from Isaac to Jacob. 3. Jacob: Jacob is the third patriarch and the son of Isaac and Rebekah. His life story is found in the book of Genesis, chapters 25-50. Jacob has twelve sons by his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and their two handmaidens, Zilpah and Bilhah. These sons went on to found the twelve tribes of Israel, making Jacob's role in Israel's history particularly significant. After a dramatic encounter with God, Jacob's name was changed to Israel, which means \\"he who struggles with God\\" (Genesis 32:28). The name Israel further cements the importance of Jacob in relation to the formation of the Israelite nation. 4. Joseph: Joseph is the fourth patriarch and the son of Jacob and Rachel. His life story can be found in the book of Genesis, chapters 37-50. As a young man, Joseph had dreams of greatness, which led to jealousy and animosity from his brothers. They sold him into slavery in Egypt, where he eventually rose to prominence as a skilled interpreter of dreams. Through divine guidance, Joseph was able to warn the Pharaoh of an impending famine, which ultimately saved Egypt and the surrounding lands. When the famine reached Canaan, Joseph's brothers traveled to Egypt for help, unaware that they were seeking assistance from the very brother they had betrayed years before. Joseph's significance lies in his wisdom, forgiveness, and ability to save his family, ultimately leading to Israel's settlement in Egypt. This set the stage for the later exodus of the Israelites from Egypt under Moses's leadership. In conclusion, the patriarchs of the Old Testament – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph – play crucial roles in shaping the spiritual and historical foundations of the Abrahamic faiths. As the founding fathers of the Israelite people, their narratives reflect the development of the Israelites' relationship with God and their notion of the divine promise."},{"question":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Strada, eatType = pub, food = Chinese, customer rating = average, near = Yippee Noodle Bar Sentence:","response":"Strada is a unique dining establishment that combines the lively atmosphere of a traditional pub with an exotic menu featuring an array of Chinese cuisine options, which garners an average customer rating owing to its fusion-style offerings, conveniently situated near the popular Yippee Noodle Bar enhancing the diverse gastronomic experience for food enthusiasts in the area."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station.

Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an \\"F\\" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an \\"A\\". It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was \\"self-aware\\". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm \\"reading too much\\" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he \\"didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend\\" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something \\"more adult\\". Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, \\"While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film\\". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

ISIL, also called ISIS, released a grisly video of his beheading Tuesday, claiming it killed him in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in the region. But another issue was money. The group had also captured French and Spanish journalists, but freed them after their governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay the group on behalf of Foley and other American captives. ISIL emailed Michael Foley and demanded 100 million euros—a sum he called “ridiculous”—for his brother’s release. “I just feel strongly that more can be done moving forward,” Michael Foley said. The Obama administration said this week that it had sent a special military operations force to try to rescue Foley and the other Americans over the summer, but that the mission failed. “I’d like to think it did happen, but I certainly wasn’t aware of it,” Foley said of the failed mission. ISIL has threatened to kill another captured American journalist, Steven Sotloff, next. Michael Foley said he hopes the U.S. government does more on his behalf, including considering trading prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. “I don't believe ISIL can be contained — containment is not a strategy. We need to recognize that they are a threat and we need to deal with them,” Michael Foley said. Michael Foley and his sister Katie, 26, told Couric that condolences have come pouring in from all around the world. Pope Francis called their family yesterday, telling them that James Foley’s death was an act of martyrdom. The family briefly had hope that they would be able to negotiate for his release, after an intermediary made contact with ISIL on their behalf. But then the U.S. government began bombing ISIL earlier this month. On August 12, ISIL sent Foley’s parents a “chilling” email saying their son would die to pay for the airstrikes, according to Michael Foley. “I don’t understand where that type of hate could come from,” Katie Foley said. The family believes that Foley volunteered to be the first American to be executed. “You can see from the clips from the video that he wasn’t afraid,” Michael Foley said. European journalists who were captured by ISIL but later freed told Foley’s family that the journalist made a makeshift board game out of objects they found and even taught his fellow captives Spanish as a way to keep hope alive. The U.S. government says they will hunt down and punish Foley’s killers. “We will be relentless,” President Barack Obama said this week. “When people harm Americans anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.” Foley’s friends have set up a scholarship fund in his name at Marquette University, where he graduated in 1996, for disadvantaged students.

ISIS militants have claimed responsibility for executing the American photojournalist. The group sent Foley's parents an email on Aug. 12, stating that their son would be \\"executed.\\" The email was the first communication the Foleys had received from their son's captors since December of 2013, which initially left them hopeful they could find a way to bring him home safely. Today John and Diane Foley \\"I actually was excited to see an email despite the conclusion that they would execute Jim,'' his father said. \\"We underestimated that point. I did not realize how brutal they were, and I actually hoped we could engage in negotiations with them if they were willing to send any sort of communication because we had none prior.\\" A French journalist who was released in April and shared a cell with Foley spoke about his courage and noted how he was treated more harshly because he was American. \\"Jim's courage and particularly his compassion and love in that box, which they called it, was an answer to prayer,'' his mother said. \\"We had so many people praying for Jimmy.

The killer and his terrorist group are responsible for Foley’s death. They should be the focus of public anger. But Foley’s execution is also a chilling wake-up call for American and European policymakers, as well as U.S. news outlets and aid organizations. It is the clearest evidence yet of how vastly different responses to kidnappings by U.S. and European governments save European hostages but can doom the Americans. Hostages and their families realize this fully — even if the public does not. “I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed,” Foley said moments before he was killed in a craven video released by the militant group on Tuesday. “I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.” Foley clearly spoke under duress. But his regret at being an American captive, real or not, reflected grim fact. This spring, four French and two Spanish journalists held hostage by the Islamic State extremists were freed — after the French and Spanish governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. The U.S. government refused to negotiate or pay a ransom in Foley’s case or for any other American captives — including my own abduction by the Taliban five years ago. With the help of an Afghan journalist abducted with me, I was lucky enough to escape. But today Foley is dead and the Islamic State militants now say Steven Sotloff, a journalist for Time magazine whom the group also captured, will be killed if the United States does not stop bombing its fighters in Iraq. There are no easy answers in kidnapping cases. The United States cannot allow terrorist groups to control its foreign policy. One clear lesson that has emerged in recent years, however, is that security threats are more effectively countered by united American and European action. The divergent U.S. and European approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims. Last month, a New York Times investigation found that al Qaeda and its direct affiliates had received at least 125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008 — primarily from European governments. In the last year alone, they received 66 million. “Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil,” Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wrote in a 2012 letter to the leader of an al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa, “which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.” Publicly, European governments deny making these payments. But former diplomats told the Times that ransoms have been paid through intermediaries. Kidnapping as a fundraising tactic is thriving and rates are going up. In 2003, a ransom of roughly 200,000 was paid for each captive, the newspaper found. Today, captors reap millions per captive. Abductions have become so lucrative that al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan help oversee negotiations for affiliates. Militants groups spread across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia are now following the same rough protocol. Hostage-taking by extremist groups is now so pervasive that at least one major aid organization is not sending U.S. aid workers to areas where they might be abducted. Instead, they are sending citizens from European countries with governments that will pay ransoms. The cases have taken on a grim pattern: Hostages are abducted, months pass with no news from the captors and a threatening video or email is then sent to families. In some cases, the militants ask that cases not be made public so ransom can be paid quietly. This was the case in Foley’s tortuous, 21-month abduction. For the first 16 months after Foley was taken captive, his family had no information regarding his whereabouts. They learned he was alive from two Spanish journalists who were freed by the Islamic State in March after a ransom was paid. In a subsequent email message, the captors instructed the family to keep the case quiet and not identify the Islamic State as the kidnappers. Fearing for Foley’s life, the family obeyed. Other American families with loved ones taken captive by militants have done the same. Privately, the Foleys and other families have grown intensely frustrated with the failure of American officials to negotiate with the captors. U.S. government officials also refused to coordinate their response in any way with European governments. In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions. Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government. A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing. James Foley must not die in vain.

James Foley's brother, Michael Foley, said he thinks the government of the United States could have done more to help free his brother and the other people who were taken. He wants the government to think about how they handle situations like this. Some governments from other countries paid money to the bad people to get their people back safely, but the United States did not do that. Sadly, James Foley was killed by the bad people. Now, the United States government and other people want to make sure those bad people are punished.

It can be an interesting or surprising detail, historical event, scientific discovery, or obscure fact that may not be widely known or discussed. Random facts are typically shared to spark interest or add to a conversation and can be fun, educational, or both. They can cover any area of knowledge, such as science, history, math, art, or popular culture – essentially, any topic where there is an unexpected or unique detail. For example, here's a random fact about octopuses: Unlike most animals, octopuses have three hearts. Two of their hearts are responsible for pumping blood through the gills to oxygenate it, while the third heart circulates the oxygenated blood throughout the rest of the body. This unique anatomy is a direct adaptation of octopuses' muscular and sophisticated arms, which require a lot of energy and oxygen to function efficiently. The three-heart system plays a crucial role in providing the necessary oxygen and nutrients to support the impressive dexterity and strength of their arms. This peculiar fact about octopuses may not be commonly known, even among people who are familiar with these marine creatures.

Translate to English","response":"The shipbuilding industry will certainly not benefit from it. The shipbuilding industry is a sector that specializes in the design, construction, maintenance, and repair of various types of ships, including commercial, military, and special-purpose vessels. This industry plays a critical role in the global economy by contributing to international trade, defense, and tourism. When discussing the factors that could potentially impact the shipbuilding industry negatively, it is important to consider various economic, political, social, and environmental aspects. 1. Economic factors: The global economy can have a significant impact on the shipbuilding industry. If the world economy experiences a downturn or crisis, this can potentially lead to a reduction in demand for new ships, as well as a decrease in international trade. In turn, this would affect the revenue and profits of the companies operating in this sector. 2. Political factors: Government policies and regulation can also play a significant role in the functioning of the shipbuilding industry. For example, changes in trade policies can impact the demand for vessels, especially if countries impose restrictions on imports or exports. Similarly, fluctuations in defense budgets can affect the demand for military ships. Furthermore, international relations and conflicts can have a negative impact on the climate within which shipbuilding companies operate, potentially leading to decreased trade and increased insecurity. 3. Social factors: Tourism, another important contributor to the shipbuilding industry, can be influenced by social factors such as global pandemics, changing consumer preferences, or other issues that affect people's desire or ability to travel. A decline in tourism can result in reduced demand for passenger vessels, such as cruise ships and ferries. 4. Environmental factors: The shipbuilding industry must also contend with growing concern for the environment, including climate change and pollution. Regulations aimed at reducing emissions from ships or protecting marine ecosystems might require substantial investments in research and development, as well as costly updates to facilities and equipment. While these goals are necessary from an environmental perspective, they can also lead to increased costs for the shipbuilding industry in the short term. 5. Technological factors: The pace of technological change can also pose challenges for the shipbuilding industry. Companies must constantly adapt to new technologies, materials, and processes to stay competitive. For instance, the increasing focus on autonomous and electric vessels requires substantial investment in the development of new systems and infrastructures. This can put additional pressure on the industry to innovate rapidly while remaining economically viable. In conclusion, the shipbuilding industry can be significantly impacted by various factors such as economic, political, social, environmental, and technological influences. The phrase \\"Laivanrakennusteollisuus ei varmasti hyödy siitä\\" suggests that there is a factor or situation at hand that will certainly not benefit the industry. Considering the potential challenges discussed above, any of those factors (or a combination of them) may be responsible for negatively affecting the shipbuilding industry."},{"question":"7reasonsforwritingthatbookyou’vebeentalkingabout|BookboonBlogSkipnavigation Generate a sentence using the above characters:","response":"To derive a meaningful sentence from the given string of characters, I will first separate the words, form a coherent phrase, and finally construct a sentence.

Hypothesis: You can exercise to be active before work.","response":"Based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis \\"You can exercise to be active before work\\" appears to be true. The paragraph suggests that incorporating morning workouts into one's routine requires choosing an enjoyable exercise that motivates the individual to wake up earlier than usual. By doing so, a person is more likely to engage in physical activity before work, hence leading to an active start of the day. Several factors contribute to the support of the hypothesis: 1. Decision-making: The paragraph emphasizes the decision-making process when it comes to selecting an exercise. By consciously choosing a type of exercise that one enjoys and is motivated by, the person can better ensure they remain committed to a morning workout routine before work. 2. Enjoyment: Enjoyment plays a significant role in the likelihood of consistently engaging in physical activity. When people find an exercise they enjoy, they are more likely to continue partaking in it and adjust their routines to accommodate the activity, in this case, waking up earlier before work. 3. Motivation: Waking up earlier than one is accustomed to demands a strong motivational factor. The paragraph suggests that looking forward to the chosen exercise could act as a driving force for waking up at an earlier time, thus enabling an individual to exercise before work. Considering these factors, the hypothesis \\"You can exercise to be active before work\\" holds true. By selecting an enjoyable and motivating exercise, an individual increases their probability of adjusting their morning routine to incorporate physical activity before work, thereby leading an active lifestyle."},{"question":"My boyfriend and I came here with a reservation on a Friday night around 6:30. We were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles. Our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief). The restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around. You might not even need a reservation. Our server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform). His interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than I expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated. The menu changes daily, so there are no specials. Everything is a special, in that sense. The wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle. Lovely! I ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience. We drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert. I was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than I expected, and I got to try five kinds of wine. Hard to beat. We had a Montravel from Spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their Riesling, which I loved. Both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store. Our appetizers were the Mac and Cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the Stuffed Poblano Peppers. The Mac 'n' Cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun. But the Peppers - just to die for. To. Die. They had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage. We were both bowled over. If this is on the menu, don't miss it. Their sausage is the real deal. Next we got two tasters of red, the Cotes-du-Rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines. Our entrees were the Suckling Pig and the Hanger Steak. The steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious. Great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual. Just high quality food. The pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better. The sweet potato mash alongside was great. My only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty. Anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste. I think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend. We absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but I'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt. For dessert I had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the \\"peanut butter ice cream sandwich\\" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining? It was very good and a great end to the meal. All this for about 75. The way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect. I'd recommend Toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers. It was such a treat, and didn't break the bank. Is this review positive or negative? Available options: (1). negative (2). positive Answer:","response":"(2). positive This review is positive because the writer describes their experience at the restaurant in a generally favorable light.

Translate this to English?","response":"Furthermore, the liberalization of the regional market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements will also increase the level of foreign direct investment, which is currently extremely low. In addition to the translation, it is essential to understand the context and implications of this statement. The sentence talks about the benefits of liberalizing a regional market and how it promotes increased foreign direct investment (FDI). The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that sets global trade rules and helps its member countries negotiate trade agreements. One of the main objectives of the WTO is to facilitate international trade and reduce barriers. Liberalization refers to the process of removing various restrictions and regulations that govern international trade, ideally making a market more open and competitive. This can take the form of reducing import tariffs, eliminating export subsidies, or lifting restrictions like quotas and licenses. Doing so allows companies from different countries to enter new markets easily, create jobs, and foster economic growth. FDI is a form of investment where a company or individual from one country acquires substantial ownership or control in a company based in another country. High levels of FDI indicate strong investor confidence, a healthy business environment, and a stable political climate. When foreign companies invest in a regional market, they bring capital, technology, know-how, and best practices from their home country, which can significantly contribute to the growth and development of the host country. The statement highlights the potential growth in FDI in the region as a result of the liberalization of the market through WTO regulations and bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements are those made between two countries, often covering trade, economic cooperation, and other areas of mutual interest. Countries negotiate their trade rules and tariffs, aiming for reduced trade barriers in these agreements, which can further promote investment and diversify their economies. In short, by adhering to WTO regulations and fostering bilateral agreements, countries can encourage the inflow of foreign investment, which in turn strengthens the overall economy and drives development."},{"question":"Valerie’s cookie recipe makes 16 dozen cookies and calls for 4 pounds of butter. She only wants to make 4 dozen cookies for the weekend. How many pounds of butter will she need? Let's answer step by step:","response":"Step 1: Determine the proportion of the desired amount of cookies to the original recipe. Valerie wants to make 4 dozen cookies, and the original recipe makes 16 dozen cookies. Proportion = (Desired amount of cookies) / (Original amount of cookies) = 4 dozen / 16 dozen Step 2: Simplify the proportion. 4 dozen / 16 dozen = 1/4 Step 3: Apply the proportion to the original amount of butter. Valerie's original recipe calls for 4 pounds of butter. To determine how much butter she'll need for 4 dozen cookies, multiply the original amount of butter by the proportion.

Question 2: Do teachers or professors look down on students who score low on test? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","response":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing, which is whether teachers or professors have a negative perception of students who score low on tests or have lower academic performance in general. To provide a detailed and long answer about this particular topic, it is important to acknowledge that teachers and professors have varying opinions of students based on their professional experience, teaching philosophy, and level of interaction with the students. 1. Empathetic Teachers: Many teachers recognize the fact that not all students have the same aptitude for learning and may perform poorly on tests. Such teachers often adopt the role of mentors, focusing on the growth and development of the student as an individual. They look for ways to improve the students' academic performance in the long term by suggesting different study strategies, offering supplementary materials for learning, or encouraging the student to seek help from tutors or other support resources. 2. Teachers With High Expectations: Some teachers may have higher expectations from their students as a way to challenge and push them to achieve greater academic success. While they may not necessarily look down on low-scoring students, these teachers may express disappointment if a student is not living up to their potential or not putting in enough effort. They believe that setting high expectations will help students strive for better results. 3. Objectivity and Fairness: A majority of teachers and professors strive for objectivity and fairness when assessing student performance. These educators are aware that every student has different strengths and weaknesses, learning styles, and backgrounds. They understand that low test scores may not necessarily indicate a lack of intelligence but could instead imply a struggling communication of knowledge and application. 4. Teachers Considering External Factors: Teachers are often aware that students may encounter situations outside of school that can affect their performance. These can include personal issues, family problems, or even health issues. Some educators try to be empathetic towards struggling students and offer support beyond the classroom, such as counseling or peer mentorship programs, to help the student overcome external challenges that may be causing their low scores. 5. Impact of Education System and Standardized Testing: The education system and standardized testing can sometimes cause teachers to judge their students based on test scores or academic performance because these metrics are quantifiable and easy to analyze. This may unintentionally lead some teachers to look down on low-scoring students due to a perceived lack of effort, intelligence, or motivation. In summary, while there may be instances where some teachers or professors look down on students with low test scores, most educators approach student performance with objectivity, empathy, high expectations, and an understanding of external factors influencing their students' lives. As teaching philosophies continue to evolve, there are increasing efforts to evaluate student progress via comprehensive and holistic methods to provide more accurate assessments and foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment."},{"question":"Translate \\"The Arab leaders also acknowledged this at the Tunis Summit in 2004.\\" to German?","response":"Natürlich kann ich das für dich tun!

The plants were the same, the trees were the same, but it still wasn't right Where did the monkey come from? Options: - rain forest - treetops - tundra - playful mood - brazil Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To determine where the monkey came from, let's evaluate each option and use logical reasoning. 1. Rainforest: The monkey might have come from a rainforest, as these environments are home to a variety of monkey species. In a rainforest, the monkey would be accustomed to the rich diversity of plants, trees, and animal life. This option seems very likely. 2. Treetops: Treetops refer to the uppermost branches of trees, where some monkey species live and spend most of their time. However, this option is not a specific habitat or region. Monkeys living in the treetops are often found in rainforests and other dense forests. Thus, this option is related to the rainforest option and doesn't provide a separate explanation. 3. Tundra: The tundra biome is characterized by cold climate, few plants, and no trees; it is mainly found in the Arctic and high-altitude regions. Monkeys typically do not live in such an environment due to the harsh conditions and lack of food sources. This option is very unlikely. 4. Playful mood: This phrase does not describe any geographical area or habitat, and so does not suggest where the monkey might have come from. 5. Brazil: Brazil is a country in South America that contains part of the Amazon rainforest, which is home to many monkey species. Therefore, the monkey may have come from Brazil, specifically the rainforest in Brazil. Based on our reasoning, we can conclude that the most likely options for where the monkey came from are the rainforest or Brazil, with Brazil referring to the rainforest in that country. These options both suggest that the monkey is native to a rainforest environment, which explains its discomfort in the zoo despite similarities in plant and tree life."},{"question":"Jump to the full entry & travel map Pompei , Campania , Italyand then came the aussies ... after venice it appeared that australians were nowhere to be foundin italy , and that americans had taken over as the travel-infesters.well that all changed in sorrento , capped by the lovely contiki tourbus keeping me up all night . anyways ... the train from roma to napoli started off well , being 90 minuteslate , and gaining lateness en route . excellent .

He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake.

Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus.

We returned the drill and opted to purchase a hammer, since the Choose from: 1). drill was useless for our building project. 2). hammer was useless for our building project.","response":"We returned the drill and opted to purchase a hammer, since the drill was useless for our building project. As we proceeded with the building project, it became more and more evident that a hammer was essential for our needs. The drill, although a valuable tool for some tasks, simply did not provide the versatility and necessary functions that the hammer could. The hammer allowed us to tackle a range of tasks, such as driving nails into various materials like wood or drywall, which were vital components in our building project. Additionally, the ability to dismantle and remove nails seamlessly was a crucial aspect for a successful project. A hammer, with its flat head, could easily get underneath a nail head and pull it out with minimal effort, making it an indispensable tool when adjustments and corrections were required. Moreover, a hammer was an effective tool for wedging and tapping items into place. During the building process, it was often necessary to make sure that the components of our structure were securely fixed and properly aligned. The hammer was the perfect tool for this purpose, as it allowed us to apply force to any part of the structure requiring a tighter connection. Versatility was another factor that made a hammer essential for our project. It proved to be useful in various stages, from the beginning of the construction process to the end. Whether we were framing walls, securing roofing materials, or installing fasteners, the hammer remained one of the most relied-upon tools we possessed. Furthermore, it became apparent that the shape and design of the hammer were highly advantageous. The curved claw on the back enabled us to extract nails efficiently, while the sturdy handle provided a comfortable grip, allowing for maximum control and precision. In contrast, the drill was not well-suited for our building project. While it excelled in drilling holes and driving screws, it simply did not have the ability nor the versatility that the hammer possessed. Drilling holes was a limited function in the context of our project, and the lack of adaptability with the tasks at hand rendered it an inessential tool. As the project progressed, the decision to exchange the drill for a hammer proved to be a wise choice. The numerous advantages of the hammer, coupled with its adaptability, made it an indispensable component of our toolkit, allowing us to complete our building project in a timely and efficient manner. Choosing the proper tool for the task at hand, in this case, opting for a hammer instead of a drill, ensured a smoother and more successful building process."},{"question":"Q: who wrote the song i like the sound of that?

Douras (1857-1935), a lawyer and judge in New York City; and Rose Reilly (1867-1928). Her father performed the civil marriage of Gloria Gould Bishop. She had three older sisters, Ethel, Rose, and Reine. An older brother, Charles, drowned at the age of 15 in 1906. Publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst and Davies lived as a couple for decades but were never married, as Hearst's wife refused to give him a divorce. At one point, he reportedly came close to marrying Davies, but decided his wife's settlement demands were too high. Hearst was extremely jealous and possessive of her, even though he was married throughout their relationship. Lita Grey, the second wife of Charlie Chaplin, wrote four decades later that Davies confided with her about the relationship with Hearst. Grey quoted Davies saying: God, I'd give everything I have to marry that silly old man. Not for the money and security--he's given me more than I'll ever need. Not because he's such cozy company, either. Most times, when he starts jawing, he bores me stiff. And certainly not because he's so wonderful behind the barn. Why, I could find a million better lays any Wednesday. No, you know what he gives me, sugar? He gives me the feeling I'm worth something to him. A whole lot of what we have, or don't have, I don't like. He's got a wife who'll never give him a divorce. She knows about me, but it's still understood that when she decides to go to the ranch for a week or a weekend, I've got to vamoose. And he snores, and he can be petty, and has sons about as old as me. But he's kind and he's good to me, and I'd never walk out on him. By the late 1930s, Hearst was suffering financial reversals. After selling many of the contents of St Donat's Castle, Davies sold her jewelry, stocks and bonds and wrote a check for 1 million to Hearst to save him from bankruptcy. Davies had developed a drinking problem over the course of many years, but her alcoholism grew worse in the latter 1930's and the 1940's, as she and Hearst lived an increasingly isolated life. The two spent most of the Second World War at Hearst's Northern California estate of Wyntoon, until returning to San Simeon in 1945. Hearst died on August 14, 1951. In his will, Hearst provided handsomely for Davies, leaving her 170,000 shares of Hearst Corporation stock, in addition to 30,000 he had established for her in a trust fund in 1950. This gave her a controlling interest in the company for a short-time, until she chose to relinquish the stock voluntarily to the corporation on October 30th 1951. She retained her original 30,000 shares and an advisory role with the corporation.

Tom and Kate receive an e-mail from the kidnappers demanding 2,000,000. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may have been behind it.

Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who is electronically disguising his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand the money over when Cubby fails to give him the directions Shaker had promised him. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby. He dies before he can reveal Sean's location. Shaker later arranges another drop off. While Tom initially agrees to take the money alone, he realizes there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive and instead appears on television to offer the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers' heads, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return his son alive and unharmed. Despite the pleadings of Kate and FBI Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance of having Sean returned.

One weekend all of the hotels were full because of a large business meeting being held in the city. On Sunday night, three men came into Mr. Black's hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Black told them that there were no more rooms available. The men didn't know what to do because they had no place to stay in. Mr. Black wanted to help them.

So, he asked the three men if they would mind sharing that small room. They replied that they would be very satisfied so long as there was a room for them to stay in for the night. Mr. Black then told them that the room would cost them 30 in total. On hearing this, each of the three men gave Mr. Black 10 before they left for their room.

Working with chemicals, especially those that are corrosive, acidic, alkaline, or have reactive properties, poses several potential dangers to the human eyes. When manipulated without proper safety measures, a chemical splash or accidental contact may occur, leading to the following negative consequences: 1. Eye irritation: Various chemicals, such as solvents or detergents, can cause mild to moderate irritation of the eye. This is characterized by redness, tearing, itching, and a burning sensation. In most cases, eye irritation can be treated effectively with flushing and over-the-counter eye drops, but persistent symptoms may require medical attention. 2. Chemical burns: Corrosive substances, such as strong acids (e.g., sulfuric or hydrochloric acid), strong bases (e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide), and some oxidizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or bleach) can cause chemical burns upon contact with the eyes. These burns can range from superficial to deep, potentially causing irreversible damage to the cornea, sclera, conjunctiva, and other ocular tissues. Chemical burns are considered a medical emergency and require immediate treatment, including extensive flushing and professional care. 3. Phototoxicity: Some chemicals, particularly photosensitizers like certain drugs or industrial compounds, can cause phototoxic reactions upon exposure to light. When absorbed by the eye, these chemicals heighten the sensitivity of ocular tissues to light, resulting in inflammation, redness, and discomfort. Proper safety measures, such as avoiding sunlight or wearing appropriate sunglasses, should be taken when dealing with photosensitizing agents. 4. Allergic reactions: Some individuals may develop allergic reactions to specific chemicals, leading to localized ocular symptoms like itching, swelling, and redness. In such cases, an individual should avoid further contact with the allergen and seek medical assistance as needed. 5. Permanent blindness: In extreme cases, exposure to certain chemicals, particularly those with corrosive properties, can lead to permanent blindness. Such damage may result from severe chemical burns or direct harm to ocular structures, such as the retina and optic nerves. To prevent these detrimental consequences, proper eye protection should be worn when working with chemicals. Safety goggles or full-face shields made from durable, impact-resistant materials are designed to safeguard the eyes from chemical splashes and contact. Additionally, following standard laboratory procedures, handling chemicals with care, maintaining adequate ventilation, and knowing the properties of the substances in use, are all important aspects of eye safety when working with chemicals. In conclusion, it is crucial to protect your eyes when working with chemicals, as different substances can easily cause a range of harmful effects, including irritation, burns, or even permanent vision loss when handled improperly. By wearing the appropriate protective equipment and following established safety practices, the risk of chemical-related eye injuries can be significantly minimized."},{"question":"Given the question: Q: What do all sound waves begin with?

Article: The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has to take care of children, her work is lightened by modern living conditions. This important change in women's life-patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls took a full-time job after they left school. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school- leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women usually marry older, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-or-part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them. Question: When she was over fifty, a late nineteenth-century mother _ .

Bruce Randall Hornsby (born November 23, 1954) is an American singer and pianist. Hornsby draws frequently from classical, jazz, bluegrass, folk, Motown, gospel, rock, blues, and jam band musical traditions. Hornsby's recordings have been recognized on a number of occasions with industry awards, including the 1987 Grammy Award for Best New Artist with Bruce Hornsby and the Range, the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album, and the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Hornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his touring band Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs and his appearances as a session and guest musician. Bruce Randall Hornsby was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, a son of Robert Stanley Hornsby (1920-1998), an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and his wife, nee Lois Saunier. Raised a Christian Scientist, he has two siblings: Robert Saunier \\"Bobby\\" Hornsby, a realtor with Hornsby Realty and locally known musician, and Jonathan Bigelow Hornsby, an engineer who has collaborated in songwriting. He graduated from James Blair High School in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1973, where he played on the basketball team. He studied music at the University of Richmond, as well as Berklee College of Music and the University of Miami, from which he graduated in 1977. In the spring of 1974 Hornsby's older brother Bobby, who attended the University of Virginia, formed the band \\"Bobby Hi-Test and the Octane Kids\\" to play fraternity parties, featuring Bruce on Fender Rhodes and vocals. The band, which is listed in Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads, performed covers of Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and predominantly Grateful Dead songs. Although Hornsby's collaboration with Bobby Hornsby would be relatively short-lived, Bobby's son R.S. was a recurring guest-guitarist with Hornsby's band and periodically toured with his uncle. His performances were often looked forward to by fans. R.S. Hornsby died on January 15, 2009 in a car accident near Crozet, Virginia. He was 28.

In 1980, he and his younger brother (and songwriting partner) John Hornsby moved to Los Angeles, where they spent three years writing for 20th Century Fox. Before moving back to his native southeastern Virginia, he also spent time in Los Angeles as a session musician. In 1982 Hornsby joined the band Ambrosia for their last album Road Island and can be seen in the band's video for the album's single \\"How Can You Love Me.\\" After Ambrosia disbanded, he and bassist Joe Puerta performed as members of the touring band for pop star Sheena Easton. Hornsby can clearly be seen in the music video for Easton's 1984 hit single \\"Strut.\\"","response":"This text is about Bruce Randall Hornsby, an American singer and pianist."},{"question":"Peter and Andrew like to run in the morning. Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew's 2 miles. After 5 days, how many miles have they both run? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","response":"To calculate the total number of miles run by Peter and Andrew over the 5 days, we'll need to break down the problem into a series of steps. Step 1: Determine the daily distance covered by Peter. Peter runs 3 miles more than Andrew, who runs 2 miles. So, we can calculate Peter's daily miles with the following expression: Peter's daily miles = Andrew's daily miles + 3 Peter's daily miles = 2 + 3 Peter's daily miles = 5 miles Step 2: Calculate the total distance covered by Peter over 5 days. Now that we know Peter runs 5 miles per day, we'll multiply that by the number of days he runs to get his total miles: Peter's total miles = Peter's daily miles × 5 Peter's total miles = 5 × 5 Peter's total miles = 25 miles Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by Andrew over 5 days. Andrew runs 2 miles per day, so we'll multiply that by the number of days he runs to get his total miles: Andrew's total miles = Andrew's daily miles × 5 Andrew's total miles = 2 × 5 Andrew's total miles = 10 miles Step 4: Find the combined total distance covered by Peter and Andrew in 5 days. Now, we'll add Peter's and Andrew's total miles together to find their combined total: Combined total miles = Peter's total miles + Andrew's total miles Combined total miles = 25 + 10 Combined total miles = 35 miles So, Peter and Andrew have run a combined total of 35 miles over the 5 days."},{"question":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: Sentence B","response":"Question: Which sentence contains a subtle contrast between two approaches?

As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges.

Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village was less thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","response":"The village that demonstrated less thoughtfulness about the environment, based on the information given in the paragraph, is the village of Forx. This conclusion can be drawn from the statement that explicitly mentions that they decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes due to its profitability, but did not consider the potential impact this activity could have on the environment. On the other hand, the village of Davin, continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, both of which have potential environmental effects, yet the paragraph does not denote whether or not they considered these effects. However, the criticism towards Davin is not as direct as it was towards Forx, which leads us to believe that Forx was less thoughtful about the environment. Sand mining can lead to significant environmental damage. The process typically involves removing massive amounts of sand from a particular area, which can lead to erosion, changes in local ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and potentially, the destruction of the homes of local wildlife. In coastal regions, sand mining can also lead to the depletion of protective beachfront sand dunes, which can increase the risk of flooding and storm damage to the community, accelerating coastal erosion and increasing the likelihood of damaging storm surges. On the contrary, commercial fishing and agriculture, while capable of causing environmental harm, have methods that can be followed to lessen that impact. This includes practices like sustainable fishing, where the population of the targeted species is allowed to maintain a healthy level, and the use of fishing techniques that do not unnecessarily harm other marine life. Similarly, sustainable farming practices can be employed that help reduce environmental harm - including rotating crops to keep the soil healthy, using natural fertilizers and pest control methods, and preventing runoff into local water sources. The absence of any explicit assertion in the paragraph that these steps were not taken by the village of Davin lets us draw the conclusion that Forx was less considerate towards the environment in their activities."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z? ? \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs.

Sweet limes, being less sour and bitter than the usual limes, would cater to Nelson's taste buds much better than the conventional variety. Hunter had always noticed that Nelson would tend to avoid sour and tangy flavors, as they were too sharp for his liking. In most social gatherings or while dining out, Nelson would tend to gravitate towards milder and sweeter food and beverages. This made Hunter quite confident that introducing the sweet lime to his friend might turn out to be a pleasant surprise and a newfound favorite for Nelson. Hunter knew that the sweet lime, with its lower acidity and higher natural sugar content, would be more in tune with Nelson's preferences. Having an entirely distinct flavor profile from the common lime, the sweet lime would exempt Nelson from experiencing the puckering sensation and the ever so subtle sense of discomfort that comes with the consumption of sour foods. Moreover, introducing the sweet lime to Nelson would not only provide him the opportunity to experience a new taste but also the chance to add a healthy and refreshing fruit to his diet. Sweet limes are known for being packed with essential nutrients such as Vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. By promoting the sweet lime, Hunter, in turn, was motivated by the desire to contribute to the overall well-being of his dear friend Nelson. In conclusion, Hunter wanted Nelson to try the sweet lime because he believed it would be much more enjoyable and palatable for Nelson, given its less sour flavor profile and numerous health benefits.

Now let's total the amount of kibble Luna was given: 1 cup (morning) + 1 cup (evening) + 1 cup (afternoon) + 2 cups (late evening) = 5 cups Since the bag started with 12 cups, and Luna was given 5 cups in total, the number of cups remaining in the bag will be: 12 cups - 5 cups = 7 cups So, Mary will find 7 cups of kibble remaining in the bag the next morning."},{"question":"What is the most logical completion of this news story?. New York (CNN) -- The United States and China could play a crucial role in helping finally to resolve the conflict that plagues the Korean Peninsula, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In one of the most violent incidents in decades, North Korea shelled a South Korean island Tuesday, killing four people. North Korea accused the South of provoking the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by holding a military exercise in the Yellow Sea. And South Korea responded by charging that the North's actions were a \\"definite military provocation.\\" In an interview with CNN, Zakaria said a long-term solution to the Korean conflict would require high-level secret talks aimed at assuring the government of China that if the two Koreas were reunified, it would not be faced with a nuclear-armed U.S. ally on its border. Zakaria: The Chinese have been pretty helpful on managing the situation, making sure that it doesn't spiral out of control, but we haven't been able to get to the next level with the Chinese, which is to say that the OPTIONS: - CNN sustain this regime. - China sustain this regime. - Chinese sustain this regime. - Fareed Zakaria sustain this regime. - Korean Peninsula sustain this regime. - Koreas sustain this regime. - New York sustain this regime. - North sustain this regime. - North Korea sustain this regime. - South sustain this regime. - South Korea sustain this regime. - South Korean sustain this regime. - U.S. sustain this regime. - United States sustain this regime. - Yellow Sea sustain this regime. - Yeonpyeong Island sustain this regime. - Zakaria sustain this regime.","response":"Chinese should actively participate in finding a permanent solution to the longstanding conflict between North and South Korea and firmly commit to the goal of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Korean Peninsula. Both the United States and China have a shared interest in maintaining regional stability, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and preventing any further escalation of violence. In recent years, however, China has been reluctant to exert significant pressure on North Korea due to fears of instability and the possibility of a unified Korea, aligned with the US, directly on its border. Conducting high-level secret talks, as suggested by Zakaria, could provide the necessary confidence-building measures for China and the US to cooperate jointly on resolving the Korean conflict. In these talks, the United States could offer reassurances to China that a reunified Korea would not pose a security threat. For instance, the US could agree to limit or remove their troop presence on the Peninsula in exchange for China's support in brokering a peaceful reunification process. On the other hand, China should also express its commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region. This could involve China engaging more actively in economic diplomacy and regional integration, opening channels for dialogue between North and South Korea, and using its influence to persuade North Korea to curb its aggressive behavior and return to negotiations. As the primary sponsors and allies of the two Koreas, the United States and China have the responsibility to facilitate dialogue and create the conditions necessary for a lasting peace. By working together in a cooperative and confidential manner, they can devise a plan that accommodates both nations' strategic interests while paving the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict. Ultimately, the most logical completion of this news story involves a concerted diplomatic effort between the United States and China, leading to a gradual reduction in tensions and the eventual reunification of the Korean Peninsula. This will require genuine commitment from both powers, trust-building measures, and sustained engagement to foster peace and prosperity in the region ─ a goal that would serve the interests of not only the Korean people but the entire international community."},{"question":"Mitchell Starc believes Australia's Tri-Series victory over England can help 'reopen a few scars' from last winter's miserable Ashes tour. England were whitewashed in the 2013/14 Test series down under and also lost both limited-overs legs, leaving the country humiliated and downtrodden. A year later they are back for a three-way one-day contest, which also involves India, before the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Ian Bell (left) was dismissed off the bowling of Mitchell Starc (centre) in the first ball of the match. Starc (second left) celebrates with his Australian team-mates after taking the wicket of Bell in the opening over. Their time away got off to a familiar start at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the home side claimed a three-wicket victory with a massive 61 balls to spare. Starc may not have had a big part to play in England's previous woes, but he started the rot this time by dismissing Ian Bell and James Taylor for ducks in the first over of the day. 'Hopefully we reopened a few scars tonight,' said the left-arm paceman. 'They're going to have to be out here for a few months now with this Tri-Series and the World Cup so there's no better way to kick off our campaign than getting one above them. 'I think we played really well with bat and ball, showed great intensity, and the only way to go is to try and improve on that.' Australia got off to the best possible start, and Starc (centre) hopes they can continue it through the series. Bell leaves the Sydney Cricket Ground pitch after being dismissed off the first ball of the match. Starc, who finished with four for 42, took man-of-the-match honours off Eoin Morgan and David Warner, who made 121 and 127 respectively. His speed helped rout England's top order and with Pat Cummins and the rested Mitchell Johnson also capable of serious pace, Starc feels that could be a key difference between the sides. 'I guess blokes bowling at 140-145kmph (87-90mph) plus is handy. It has that intimidation factor towards some of the batsmen,' he said. 'It's also about execution but having that pace is good. Pat bowled a few at 150kmph today and we obviously have Mitch coming back in at some point bowling rapid as well. It's a great combination.' Morgan excelled with the bat on his bow as England's permanent one-day captain, his century lifting the tourists towards respectability after slumping to 33 for four. Starc (right) took four for 42 and was named man-of-the-match after his impressive performance. Starc was all smiles at the end of the match, as Australia cruised to victory with 61 balls remaining. But the comprehensive defeat, which saw Australia claim a bonus point, meant he struggled to enjoy the moment. 'Overall I'm really disappointed,' he said. 'We came into the game with a lot of good preparation under our belt and within the side we would have had a lot of expectation on ourselves, so we have a lot of disappointed guys in the changing room. 'We're going to have to dust ourselves off and come back in four days (against India). 'There are certain positives we can take from the game but ultimately being four down so early has cost us. 'Simply, we weren't good enough to adapt the wicket and play accordingly. 'They bowled well up front, but nothing that we shouldn't be capable of dealing with.' England fly to Brisbane on Saturday before taking on the Indians at the Gabba on Tuesday. Write highlights for this article.","response":"Mitchell Starc, an Australian cricket player, thinks that Australia's big win in a game against England can bring back some bad memories for England. Last year, England's team lost a lot of matches and felt very sad about it. Mitchell Starc is hoping that the latest win will make England worry more and that Australia can keep playing well.

Context: The Three Rings of the Elves were called Narya, the Ring of Fire (set with a ruby); Nenya, the Ring of Water or Ring of Adamant (made of mithril and set with a \\"white stone\\"), and Vilya, the Ring of Air, the \\"mightiest of the Three\\" (made of gold and set with a sapphire). Question: elven rings of power lord of the rings?","response":"In the context of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and the larger legendarium, the Elven Rings of Power, also known as the Three Rings, are significant magical artifacts created during the Second Age by the Elf Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths of Eregion. These rings are called Narya, Nenya, and Vilya, representing the elements of Fire, Water, and Air, respectively. Narya, the Ring of Fire, is set with a ruby. It is associated with the power of inspiring others and providing resistance to weariness. This ring was initially given to Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor, and later to Círdan, the Shipwright. Eventually, it was passed on to Gandalf, who utilized it during his time in Middle-earth. Nenya, also known as the Ring of Water or Ring of Adamant, is made of mithril and set with a white stone. It possesses the power to preserve, protect, and conceal. Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlórien, carried Nenya throughout her time in Middle-earth, and she used it to protect her realm from both external threats and the passage of time. Vilya, the Ring of Air, is the mightiest of the Three Rings. Made of gold and set with a sapphire, it is ascribed with the powers of healing, preservation, and protection from weariness. Elrond, the Lord of Rivendell, bore Vilya throughout the events of \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" These Three Rings were created without the influence of Sauron, who was involved in the forging of the other Rings of Power. As a result, the Elven Rings were untainted by his malice. However, they were still subject to the power of the One Ring, which Sauron had created to dominate the other rings and their bearers. When the One Ring was destroyed at the end of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" the power of the Three Rings diminished and their time in Middle-earth came to an end."},{"question":"Translate \\"Mientras no se resuelva el problema del puente o la embarcación, será ocioso hablar de atravesar el río.\\" from Spanish to English.","response":"The translation of the Spanish sentence \\"Mientras no se resuelva el problema del puente o la embarcación, será ocioso hablar de atravesar el río\\" into English is: \\"As long as the issue of the bridge or the boat is not resolved, it will be pointless to talk about crossing the river.\\" This sentence conveys a situation where it is not worth discussing the topic of crossing a river until the problems related to the bridge or the boat have been addressed.

A:","response":"The review depicted for the C-IN2 Men's Underwear Contour Pouch Brief can be considered as both flattering and unflattering. Let's break down the review to better understand this. Flattering aspects: 1. The reviewer mentions that they really like the briefs. This implies that the product has an appealing design, quality, and overall appearance, which could potentially attract prospective buyers. 2. The fact that the reviewer took the time to write a review about the product suggests that they care about sharing their experience and opinion, indicating a level of satisfaction with the purchase. Unflattering aspects: 1. The main issue that the reviewer has with the product is the sizing, stating that the small size feels more like an extra-small. This can be considered unflattering as it may suggest inconsistencies in the sizing chart or a lack of accurate representation for customer expectations. This could deter potential buyers who are particular about the fit and comfort of their underwear. 2.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

The correct answer is \\"no.\\" The main country that influenced Japan in the region, according to the paragraph, was China. Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society, and many Japanese monks, scholars, and artists studied Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting. The paragraph mentions Christianity and Northern Europe as a comparison to illustrate how another religion (Christianity) brought a different culture to a different region (Northern Europe) but does not state that Northern Europe influenced Japan."},{"question":"Write a sentence not in English.","response":"Step 1: Choose a foreign language.

When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as dolly vardens and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish.

He is the son of April (Gholson) Tucker, who was seventeen when he was born, and Claude Neverson Jr. Raised as a military brat by his mother and stepfather, Songz did not have aspirations for a musical career as a child due to his shyness, saying \\"Singing wasn't a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good.\\" He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14. While recording his debut album in 2004, Songz released multiple mixtapes under the alias Prince of Virginia. One of the mixtapes featured an \\"answer track\\" to R. Kelly's \\"Trapped in the Closet\\", entitled \\"Open the Closet\\". The song gave Songz some notoriety. His debut album, I Gotta Make It was released on July 26, 2005. It debuted at #20 on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies in its first week of sales. It has sold 300,000 records in the US. Songz's debut single, Gotta Make It, featuring Twista, was released in March 2005 and reached #87 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. It garnered success in the R&B/urban community but failed to make a mark in mainstream music. The album's second and final single, Gotta Go, was released in July 2005 and reached #67 on the Hot 100 and #11 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming even more successful than his debut single in the R&B/urban community and in the mainstream community.

The album was going to be released on May 8, 2007, but was continually delayed in order for a successful single to precede the album, as the lead single failed to impact charts. His second album was preceded by the lead single, \\"Wonder Woman\\", which was released in February 2007. It reached #54 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to impact the Hot 100. Because of the single's failure, his second album was delayed from May 2007 to October 2007.

The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way.

Position your fingers. Remove the lens. Try the catch method. Use the suction cup method. Know when to call for help.","response":"Title: Contact Lens Removal Made Easy: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction As a contact lens wearer, it is essential to master the art of inserting and removing your lenses. It may seem daunting at first, but with practice and guidance, you'll soon be able to do it with ease. To help you overcome any apprehension, we've prepared a step-by-step guide covering the best methods to get those lenses out safely and effectively. Step 1: Get Yourself Ready Before you begin the lens removal process, it is essential to prepare yourself and your environment. First, wash your hands thoroughly using soap and water, and dry them with a clean towel. Ensure your workspace is clean and well-lit, with a mirror available to help guide your movements. Have your contact lens case or solution nearby for easy access during the process. Step 2: Position Your Fingers Whether you're using the catch method or the suction cup method, positioning your fingers correctly is crucial. Use your non-dominant hand to hold your upper eyelid open by gently pulling up on your lashes. Meanwhile, with your dominant hand, use your middle finger to hold your lower eyelid open. This step will help prevent your eyes from blinking during lens removal. Step 3: Remove the Lens Once your fingers are in position and your eye is steady, it's time to remove your contact lens. Option A: Try the Catch Method This method involves using your index finger and thumb to directly grasp the lens. Gently press your index finger and thumb together on the contact lens, pinching it slightly. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or touch your eye directly, as this may cause discomfort. Once you have a secure grip on the lens, pull it away from your eye and place it in your contact lens case or solution. Option B: Use the Suction Cup Method If you find the catch method challenging or have long fingernails, a suction device can be a helpful option. Press the suction cup onto the contact lens, ensuring it is centered and secure. Gently pull the lens away from your eye using the suction cup's handle. Once removed, release the lens from the suction cup and place it in your contact lens case or solution. Step 4: Know When to Call for Help If you are unable to remove your contact lens using the techniques above, or if you experience excessive discomfort or eye irritation, it is essential to know when to seek professional help. Contact your eye care professional or visit an urgent care center if you need assistance with lens removal. Conclusion Removing your contact lenses can be a simple process once you become familiar with the proper techniques. Practice makes perfect, and with time you'll gain the dexterity and confidence needed to remove your lenses with ease.

Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold. Instagram was alive with “OOOOOOOH MY GOD YOU GOT TO MEET HAROLLLLLD” Forget being a rockstar in this day and age, puppy dog eyes are all you need to make ladies weep and then squeal into their keyboards. We tumbled off the train, cheeks ruddy from the fresh the North Sea breezes (fresh from visiting the Seal colony with a litany of pups at Donna Nook, and nibbling fish and chips with the family in Cleethorpes) and went wandering. I’m going to make a big claim here – if you’re travelling through the UK and can only fit in one city visit outside of London, York or perhaps Bath would be excellent choices. Compact enough to really explore, full of ancient buildings and history, and good cake. What more do you even need?

Options: - yes - no The thought process:","response":"Yes, the above claim is true. This theory is commonly known as the Giant Impact Hypothesis or Theia Impact. Thought process: The Giant Impact Hypothesis posits that around 4.5 billion years ago, during the early formation and evolution of the Solar System, a Mars-sized celestial body (named Theia) collided with the proto-Earth. This massive collision resulted in the ejection of a substantial amount of debris into Earth's orbit. Over time, this debris coalesced and eventually formed the Moon. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: 1. The Moon's composition and isotopes: The isotopes found in Moon rocks are very similar to those found on Earth, supporting the idea that both bodies formed from the same source material. However, there are also some differences in the composition of the Moon and Earth, such as the Moon's lower iron content, which can be explained by the impact hypothesis. 2. Large angular momentum: The Earth-Moon system has a relatively large angular momentum, which is consistent with the idea of a giant impact event transferring significant amounts of angular momentum to the Earth-Moon system. 3. Computer simulations: Numerical simulations of the impact of a Mars-sized body with Earth have provided evidence that is consistent with the observed properties of the Earth-Moon system, including the relative masses and angular momentum. 4. The Moon's age: Radiometric dating of lunar samples has shown that the Moon is about 4.5 billion years old, which is consistent with the age of the Solar System and the proposed timing of the Giant Impact event. In conclusion, the Giant Impact Hypothesis is supported by various lines of evidence and is currently the most widely accepted explanation for the formation of the Moon."},{"question":"Although 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, this percentage has been declining since 1996.

Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers. and a hint : Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find. Please answer this question : Would companies in Sweden find return on investment harder or easier? Answer:","response":"Companies in Sweden would likely find return on investment harder when it comes to transmission and distribution due to the breaking up of large companies into smaller ones. This is because the smaller companies may struggle to find the same economies of scale and efficiency gains as larger companies, making it more challenging for them to achieve returns on investment in the transmission and distribution aspects of the electricity market.

This important river in the southeastern United States begins its journey in the Blue Ridge Mountains, specifically at the Chattahoochee Spring in Jacks Knob, Georgia, which is at an elevation of about 3,500 feet. The river travels approximately 430 miles (690 kilometers) before merging with the Flint River to form the Apalachicola River at the Florida border, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout its long course, the Chattahoochee River flows through a variety of landscapes, including forests, urban areas, and agricultural lands. Once it leaves the northern Georgia mountains, it flows through the Atlanta metropolitan area, making it an essential source of drinking water for millions of people. It then continues to course through western Georgia and eastern Alabama, providing water for numerous communities, industries, as well as agricultural and recreational activities. The Chattahoochee River plays a significant role in the ecology of the region. It supports a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems, fostering a healthy environment for numerous flora and fauna species to thrive. That includes many species of fish, such as striped bass, largemouth bass, and catfish, which have crucial ecological and economic value. A variety of recreational activities take place along the Chattahoochee River, including fishing, boating, and whitewater rafting. There are also several parks, walking trails, and protected areas along its banks, encouraging locals and visitors to engage in outdoor adventures and appreciate the river's natural beauty. The river has a rich history and cultural significance, too. Native Americans, like the Creek and Cherokee peoples, once inhabited the lands surrounding the Chattahoochee River, where they relied on the river as a vital source of water, food, and transportation. Additionally, the region witnessed significant events during the American Civil War. In summary, the Chattahoochee River, which forms the border between Georgia and Alabama, plays a vital role in various aspects, including the supply of drinking water, supporting ecosystems, recreational activities, and reflecting cultural heritage, making it an invaluable resource for the southeastern United States."},{"question":"Pick from: [1]. 500 [2]. 400 [3]. 10,000 [4]. 20,000 Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question.

Angel di Maria struggled - one of his shots ballooned out of the stadium. Argentine winger was signed for £60m from Real Madrid last summer. Di Maria started superbly but has struggled with injuries in England. Louis van Gaal has played him as a striker in recent weeks. Write an article based on these highlights.","response":"Title: Angel Di Maria's Journey From £60m Real Madrid Sensation to Struggling Manchester United Star Subtitle: Argentine winger's performance in recent 0-0 draw against Cambridge United sparks concern As Manchester United went head to head against Cambridge United on Friday night, a draw that ended in a goalless tie, speculations surrounding Angel Di Maria's form continue to arise. The Argentine winger struggled throughout the match, with one of his many shots ballooning out of the stadium. This has led to questions about Di Maria's position at the club, as well as the adjustments being made by United's manager, Louis van Gaal, who has been playing him as a striker in recent weeks. The 27-year-old Angel Di Maria was signed for a whopping £60m from the elite European club, Real Madrid last summer, making him the most expensive signing in the history of Manchester United. Upon his arrival in England, the Argentine international was widely regarded as one of the best football players in the world, having played an instrumental role in Real Madrid's famous 'La Decima' Champions League triumph. Di Maria started his Manchester United career superbly, scoring three goals and providing four assists in his first five appearances for the club. Unfortunately, injuries have plagued Di Maria's time in England. The winger has been in and out of the United line-up since his arrival and as a result, has struggled to find the kind of form that gained him a big-money move to Old Trafford. As the Premier League season advanced, Di Maria's performances began to falter. His inconsistent form drew criticisms from both fans and pundits alike, with some even suggesting that he has not lived up to his massive price tag. As a result, United manager Louis van Gaal decided to experiment with Di Maria's position on the field, opting to play him as a forward rather than in his preferred wide role. In the recent match against Cambridge United, Di Maria failed to make the desired impact. He repeatedly lost possession, missed goal-scoring opportunities and topped it off with an embarrassing shot that went way off target. While it may be only one match, this performance highlighted the issues surrounding Di Maria's form and begs the question - is he being properly utilized, or has he just failed to adapt to English football? Some argue that the change in position is to be blamed for Di Maria's recent struggles, pointing out that the Argentine star performed best when playing as a winger. They believe that Louis van Gaal's decision to play him as a striker is a direct cause of his decline in form, as the position may not suit the strengths of Di Maria's game. Others opine that Di Maria's inability to stay fit for long periods has had a significant effect on his performance. Injuries have forced him to miss key matches, and the lack of a consistent run of games has made it difficult for him to establish a steady form. In conclusion, Angel Di Maria's struggles in recent times can be attributed to various factors, including his change in position and a history of injuries. While it remains to be seen whether the Argentine winger would eventually adapt to the English game and truly live up to his £60m price tag, one thing is certain - Manchester United fans, as well as football enthusiasts, would be hoping that Di Maria rediscovers his sensational form to reclaim his position as one of the best football players in the world."},{"question":"Please answer the following question: What key details about alec skempton can be extracted from the following bio?

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","response":"more. If more rain falls, it increases the amount of water that seeps into cracks and pores of the soil and rock. As explained in the process description, rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere, soil, and decaying vegetation, forming a weak carbonic acid solution. This solution is responsible for dissolving calcite and forming solution cavities. As the amount of rainwater increases, the water will absorb more carbon dioxide, and the concentration of carbonic acid will be higher. This will result in a more intense dissolution of calcite and more salt being removed from the water. Since the question asks for how it will affect LESS salt being removed, the increased rainfall has a more significant effect on the second effect mentioned, which is the dissolution of calcite by the weak carbonic acid solution."},{"question":"In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list.
